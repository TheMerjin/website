Absolutely! Here’s a full LessWrong design style guide, starting from abstract principles and progressing all the way down to very specific UI/visual details — no rounded corners, minimal decoration, focused on clarity and neutrality, fitting the LessWrong ethos:
LessWrong Design Style Guide
1. Design Philosophy (Abstract Principles)

    Minimalism & clarity: Design to reduce visual clutter, distraction, and ambiguity. Use minimal styling to highlight content and function.

    Neutral and information-dense: Avoid flashy or decorative elements. Prioritize readability and ease of parsing large amounts of information.

    Consistency and predictability: UI elements behave and look consistently, reducing cognitive load and improving user confidence.

    Accessibility-first: Design interfaces that everyone can use, including keyboard navigation, screen readers, and color-blind friendly palettes.

    Function-driven aesthetics: Form follows function; every visual decision must serve clarity, legibility, or usability.

2. Layout & Structure

    Use simple grid or flexbox layouts with clear structure.

    Avoid complex or asymmetrical layouts unless necessary.

    Content is contained in max-width containers (~700-900px) centered horizontally on the page for readability.

    Use white space generously to separate content groups but avoid excess padding/margin that wastes space.

    No floating or overlapping elements.

    No sidebars or overlays that obscure primary content unless explicitly contextual.

3. Typography

    Use serif fonts for body text for readability and a scholarly feel (e.g., Georgia, serif).

    Use sans-serif fonts for UI, headers, and labels (e.g., Inter, Helvetica, Arial).

    Font sizes:

        Body text: ~16px (1rem)

        Headers: progressively larger but restrained (h1 ~1.2rem, h2 ~1.02rem, h3 ~1rem)

    Font weights: Use normal (400) or medium (500-600) for emphasis; avoid ultra-bold or light fonts.

    Line height: 1.4 to 1.6 for good readability.

    Avoid all caps, italics only for subtle emphasis or citations.

    Avoid decorative fonts.

4. Color Palette

    Use neutral colors for backgrounds and text:

        Background: Very light gray or off-white (#f9f9f9 or #fff)

        Primary text: Dark gray or near black (#1a1a1a)

        Secondary text: Medium gray (#444 or #666)

    Use blue tones for links and buttons (#2b6cb0 or similar).

    Use red shades for errors or urgent statuses (#b91c1c).

    Use yellow/orange for warnings or due soon (#92400e).

    Avoid bright or saturated colors.

    Avoid gradients, shadows, or glows.

    Maintain high contrast for accessibility.

    Avoid color combinations problematic for color blindness (use tools to check).

5. UI Elements — Specifics
Buttons

    Rectangular, no rounded corners (0 border-radius).

    Border: 1px solid neutral gray (#aaa) or blue (#2b6cb0) for primary.

    Background: light gray (#eee) or white for default; blue background for primary buttons.

    Text: dark gray or white depending on background.

    Hover: slightly darker background or border.

    Padding: 0.18rem vertical, 0.8rem horizontal.

    Font: Inter or similar, 1rem.

    No shadows or gradients.

    No icon-only buttons; always use text labels.

Links

    Underlined text by default.

    Color: blue (#2b6cb0).

    On hover: underline remains, color darkens (#232323).

    Border: 1px solid #bdbdbd for button-like links.

    Background: none or very subtle.

    Padding: 0.1rem vertical, 0.5rem horizontal.

    No rounded corners.

Inputs & Forms

    Borders: 1px solid #ddd or #ccc.

    Background: white.

    Text color: #1a1a1a.

    No rounded corners.

    Padding: 0.3rem vertical, 0.5rem horizontal.

    Font: inherit from body.

    Focus: outline with solid 2px blue (#2b6cb0), no shadows.

    Labels above inputs, left-aligned, medium font weight.

Tables

    Full width tables with border-collapse: collapse.

    Borders: 1px solid #ddd for cells.

    Header background: #f5f5f5.

    Header font-weight: 600.

    No rounded corners.

    Row hover: light gray background (#f9f9f9).

    Font: serif for content, sans-serif for headers.

6. Icons & Images

    Use icons sparingly and only where they add clarity.

    No decorative or flashy icons.

    Prefer simple line icons or small SVGs.

    Avoid drop shadows or color gradients on icons.

    Alt text required for accessibility.

7. Spacing & Sizing

    Use a modular scale for spacing, e.g. multiples of 4px or 8px.

    Margins and padding for text blocks: 0.5rem to 1rem.

    No excessive gaps or uneven spacing.

    Buttons and clickable elements should have minimum touch target of 44x44px.

8. Interactions & Animations

    Use minimal animations; only subtle fade or instant feedback.

    Avoid bouncing, sliding, or elaborate transitions.

    Focus states clearly visible (blue outline).

    No automatic pop-ups or modals that distract.

9. Accessibility

    Use semantic HTML5 tags: <main>, <section>, <nav>, <header>.

    Provide aria-label and roles where necessary.

    All interactive elements keyboard accessible.

    Sufficient color contrast (AA level).

    Screen reader friendly order and labels.
