	<h2>Who I Am</h2>
	<p>
		I'm a curious student who finds myself at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and human cognition. 
		I enjoy pushing for deep explanations whether in philosophy, literature, or technical tutorials, and I 
		have a particular fondness for humor, irony, and satire. Sometimes I test ideas with parody writing 
		or rhetorical games, but I'm genuinely interested in understanding how things work at their core.
	</p>

	<h2>Academic Pursuits</h2>
	<p>
		Currently navigating high school academics with a focus on history, physics, and debate. I've worked 
		on LEQs (Long Essay Questions) in history, tackled physics problems involving forces and slope angles, 
		and engaged in debate topics, particularly around religion and morality. I'm interested in arguments 
		for and against religious belief as a basis for morality, Hitchens's rhetoric, and evidence-based 
		moral frameworks.
	</p>

	<h2>Programming & Technology</h2>
	<p>
		I'm actively coding and experimenting across several domains:
	</p>
	
	<h3>Machine Learning & AI</h3>
	<p>
		Working on neuroevolution by modifying Karpathy's makemore project to evolve MLP weights. I've built 
		a DQN for a 5×5 grid system with action masking and explored reinforcement learning concepts. I'm 
		also interested in cognitive development models like MIMo (Multi-Modal Infant Model) and self-touch 
		learning, including goal-oriented babbling (PGBB) and bouba–kiki experiments.
	</p>

	<h3>Game Development</h3>
	<p>
		Created a Krunker.io FunMod and related userscript loader, hosted Pygame games with Pygbag on Vercel, 
		and built a Lichess bot using OpenAI completions for SAN moves. I enjoy the intersection of AI and 
		gaming, particularly in chess and strategy games.
	</p>

	<h3>Web Development</h3>
	<p>
		Building a forum-like site with posting, comment trees, voting, Markdown support, Supabase authentication, 
		profiles, feed sorting, and notifications. I'm working on adding features like user-created books 
		(similar to ReadTheSequences) and version control features (a simplified Git) for the site. I've also 
		considered building a "Rate My Teacher" style platform for high school teachers.
	</p>

	<h3>Chess & Strategy</h3>
	<p>
		Developing a Node.js chess application with Supabase for correspondence play, hosted on Vercel. 
		The project combines my interest in chess strategy with web development and real-time systems.
	</p>

	<h2>Writing & Literature</h2>
	<p>
		I want my writing to feel more like Gwern's articles: dense, nuanced, and essayistic. I sometimes 
		write satirical or parody essays (including bad writing advice) and enjoy Substack-style idea prompts. 
		I appreciate enthralling, nuanced fiction and have enjoyed works like Notes from the Underground, 
		The Trial, Metamorphosis, The Lord of the Rings, and The Wednesday Wars.
	</p>

	<h2>Philosophy & Politics</h2>
	<p>
		I've read and engaged with Hobbes (Leviathan), Machiavelli (The Prince), and Rousseau (The Social Contract), 
		asking for similarities and deep dives into their ideas. I'm particularly interested in the foundations 
		of morality, the role of religion in society, and evidence-based approaches to political philosophy.
	</p>

	<h2>Interests & Hobbies</h2>
	<p>
		Beyond academics and coding, I enjoy both dark humor and light jokes, explore vegetarian meal ideas, 
		and have interests in languages including Spanish, Portuguese, and Quichua. I attended LingHacks and 
		enjoyed deep workshop explanations on Python, NLP, ML, PyTorch, LLMs, and AI ethics. I also have 
		fitness goals focused on muscle growth and strength gains.
	</p>

	<h2>Current Projects</h2>
	<p>
		Right now I'm focused on improving the user experience of my web platform, particularly the notes 
		editor and book reader. I'm working on implementing LessWrong-style design principles: minimalism, 
		clarity, neutral colors, and function-driven aesthetics. The goal is to create tools that enhance 
		thinking and knowledge management without unnecessary visual clutter.
	</p>

	<h2>Reading</h2>
	<p>
		I maintain curated lists of books I've read and books I plan to read, complete with star ratings 
		and detailed summaries. Check them out:
	</p>
	<div class="reading-links">

	<h2>Contact & Collaboration</h2>
	<p>
		I'm always interested in discussing ideas at the intersection of technology, philosophy, and human 
		cognition. Whether it's debating the foundations of morality, exploring machine learning concepts, 
		or discussing literature and writing, I enjoy conversations that push for deeper understanding.
