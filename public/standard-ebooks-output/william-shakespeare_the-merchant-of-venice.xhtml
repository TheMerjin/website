									<span>What says this leaden casket?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This casket threatens. Men that hazard all</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Do it in hope of fair advantages:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I’ll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What says the silver with her virgin hue?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And weigh thy value with an even hand:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If thou be’st rated by thy estimation,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough</span>
									<br/>
									<span>May not extend so far as to the lady:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And yet to be afeard of my deserving</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Were but a weak disabling of myself.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As much as I deserve! Why, that’s the lady:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In graces and in qualities of breeding;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But more than these, in love I do deserve.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What if I stray’d no further, but chose here?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let’s see once more this saying graved in gold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why, that’s the lady; all the world desires her;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From the four corners of the earth they come,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For princes to come view fair Portia:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As o’er a brook, to see fair Portia.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One of these three contains her heavenly picture.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is’t like that lead contains her? ’Twere damnation</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To think so base a thought: it were too gross</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or shall I think in silver she’s immured,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was set in worse than gold. They have in England</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A coin that bears the figure of an angel</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stamped in gold, but that’s insculp’d upon;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But here an angel in a golden bed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lies all within. Deliver me the key:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!</span>
