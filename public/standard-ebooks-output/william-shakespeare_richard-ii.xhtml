									<span>That they are not the first of fortune’s slaves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That many have and others must sit there;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of such as have before endured the like.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thus play I in one person many people,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And so I am: then crushing penury</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Persuades me I was better when a king;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then am I king’d again: and by and by</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Think that I am unking’d by Bolingbroke,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And straight am nothing: but whate’er I be,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor I nor any man that but man is</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With being nothing. Music do I hear? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Music.</i></span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When time is broke and no proportion kept!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So is it in the music of men’s lives.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And here have I the daintiness of ear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To check time broke in a disorder’d string;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But for the concord of my state and time</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whereto my finger, like a dial’s point,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke’s proud joy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o’ the clock.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For ’tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</span>
