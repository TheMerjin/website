									<span>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</span>

									<span>I will be brief, for my short date of breath</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is not so long as is a tedious tale.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And she, there dead, that Romeo’s faithful wife:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I married them; and their stol’n marriage-day</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was Tybalt’s dooms-day, whose untimely death</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Banish’d the new-made bridegroom from this city,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You, to remove that siege of grief from her,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Betroth’d and would have married her perforce</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To County Paris: then comes she to me,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>To rid her from this second marriage,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then gave I her, so tutor’d by my art,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As I intended, for it wrought on her</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That he should hither come as this dire night,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To help to take her from her borrow’d grave,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Being the time the potion’s force should cease.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was stay’d by accident, and yesternight</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Return’d my letter back. Then all alone</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At the prefixed hour of her waking,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Came I to take her from her kindred’s vault;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But when I came, some minute ere the time</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And bear this work of heaven with patience:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All this I know; and to the marriage</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Miscarried by my fault, let my old life</span>
