				<span epub:type="label">Scene</span>
				<span epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">I</span>
			</h2>
			<p>The firemen’s forecastle of a transatlantic liner an hour after sailing from New York for the voyage across. Tiers of narrow, steel bunks, three deep, on all sides. An entrance in rear. Benches on the floor before the bunks. The room is crowded with men, shouting, cursing, laughing, singing⁠—a confused, inchoate uproar swelling into a sort of unity, a meaning⁠—the bewildered, furious, baffled defiance of a beast in a cage. Nearly all the men are drunk. Many bottles are passed from hand to hand. All are dressed in dungaree pants, heavy ugly shoes. Some wear singlets, but the majority are stripped to the waist.</p>
			<p>The treatment of this scene, or of any other scene in the play, should by no means be naturalistic. The effect sought after is a cramped space in the bowels of a ship, imprisoned by white steel. The lines of bunks, the uprights supporting them, cross each other like the steel framework of a cage. The ceiling crushes down upon the men’s heads. They cannot stand upright. This accentuates the natural stooping posture which shovelling coal and the resultant over-development of back and shoulder muscles have given them. The men themselves should resemble those pictures in which the appearance of Neanderthal Man is guessed at. All are hairy-chested, with long arms of tremendous power, and low, receding brows above their small, fierce, resentful eyes. All the civilized white races are represented, but except for the slight differentiation in color of hair, skin, eyes, all these men are alike.</p>

			</h2>
			<p>Two days out. A section of the promenade deck. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Mildred Douglas</b> and her aunt are discovered reclining in deck chairs. The former is a girl of twenty, slender, delicate, with a pale, pretty face marred by a self-conscious expression of disdainful superiority. She looks fretful, nervous and discontented, bored by her own anemia. Her aunt is a pompous and proud⁠—and fat⁠—old lady. She is a type even to the point of a double chin and lorgnettes. She is dressed pretentiously, as if afraid her face alone would never indicate her position in life. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Mildred</b> is dressed all in white.</p>
			<p>The impression to be conveyed by this scene is one of the beautiful, vivid life of the sea all about⁠—sunshine on the deck in a great flood, the fresh sea wind blowing across it. In the midst of this, these two incongruous, artificial figures, inert and disharmonious, the elder like a gray lump of dough touched up with rouge, the younger looking as if the vitality of her stock had been sapped before she was conceived, so that she is the expression not of its life energy but merely of the artificialities that energy had won for itself in the spending.</p>

			</h2>
			<p>The stokehole. In the rear, the dimly-outlined bulks of the furnaces and boilers. High overhead one hanging electric bulb sheds just enough light through the murky air laden with coal dust to pile up masses of shadows everywhere. A line of men, stripped to the waist, is before the furnace doors. They bend over, looking neither to right nor left, handling their shovels as if they were part of their bodies, with a strange, awkward, swinging rhythm. They use the shovels to throw open the furnace doors. Then from these fiery round holes in the black a flood of terrific light and heat pours full upon the men who are outlined in silhouette in the crouching, inhuman attitudes of chained gorillas. The men shovel with a rhythmic motion, swinging as on a pivot from the coal which lies in heaps on the floor behind to hurl it into the flaming mouths before them. There is a tumult of noise⁠—the brazen clang of the furnace doors as they are flung open or slammed shut, the grating, teeth-gritting grind of steel against steel, of crunching coal. This clash of sounds stuns one’s ears with its rending dissonance. But there is order in it, rhythm, a mechanical regulated recurrence, a tempo. And rising above all, making the air hum with the quiver of liberated energy, the roar of leaping flames in the furnaces, the monotonous throbbing beat of the engines.</p>

As for her, during his speech she has listened, paralyzed with horror, terror, her whole personality crushed, beaten in, collapsed, by the terrific impact of this unknown, abysmal brutality, naked and shameless. As she looks at his gorilla face, as his eyes bore into hers, she utters a low, choking cry and shrinks away from him, putting both hands up before her eyes to shut out the sight of his face, to protect her own.

			<p>Three weeks later. A corner of Fifth Avenue in the Fifties on a fine, Sunday morning. A general atmosphere of clean, well-tidied, wide street; a flood of mellow, tempered sunshine; gentle, genteel breezes. In the rear, the show windows of two shops, a jewelry establishment on the corner, a furrier’s next to it. Here the adornments of extreme wealth are tantalizingly displayed. The jeweler’s window is gaudy with glittering diamonds, emeralds, rubies, pearls, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, fashioned in ornate tiaras, crowns, necklaces, collars, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> From each piece hangs an enormous tag from which a dollar sign and numerals in intermittent electric lights wink out the incredible prices. The same in the furrier’s. Rich furs of all varieties hang there bathed in a downpour of artificial light. The general effect is of a background of magnificence cheapened and made grotesque by commercialism, a background in tawdry disharmony with the clear light and sunshine on the street itself.</p>

			<p>Night of the following day. A row of cells in the prison on Blackwells Island. The cells extend back diagonally from right front to left rear. They do not stop, but disappear in the dark background as if they ran on, numberless, into infinity. One electric bulb from the low ceiling of the narrow corridor sheds its light through the heavy steel bars of the cell at the extreme front and reveals part of the interior. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> can be seen within, crouched on the edge of his cot in the attitude of Rodin’s <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">The Thinker</i>. His face is spotted with black and blue bruises. A bloodstained bandage is wrapped around his head.</p>

			<p>Nearly a month later. An <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.W.W.</abbr> local near the waterfront, showing the interior of a front room on the ground floor, and the street outside. Moonlight on the narrow street, buildings massed in black shadow. The interior of the room, which is general assembly room, office, and reading room, resembles some dingy settlement boys club. A desk and high stool are in one corner. A table with papers, stacks of pamphlets, chairs about it, is at center. The whole is decidedly cheap, banal, commonplace and unmysterious as a room could well be. The secretary is perched on the stool making entries in a large ledger. An eye shade casts his face into shadows. Eight or ten men, longshoremen, iron workers, and the like, are grouped about the table. Two are playing checkers. One is writing a letter. Most of them are smoking pipes. A big signboard is on the wall at the rear, “Industrial Workers of the World⁠—Local <abbr>No.</abbr> 57.”</p>

			<p>Twilight of the next day. The monkey house at the Zoo. One spot of clear gray light falls on the front of one cage so that the interior can be seen. The other cages are vague, shrouded in shadow from which chatterings pitched in a conversational tone can be heard. On the one cage a sign from which the word “gorilla” stands out. The gigantic animal himself is seen squatting on his haunches on a bench in much the same attitude as Rodin’s <i epub:type="se:name.visual-art.sculpture">Thinker</i>. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> enters from the left. Immediately a chorus of angry chattering and screeching breaks out. The gorilla turns his eyes but makes no sound or move.</p>

I’m in de middle tryin’ to separate ’em, takin’ all de woist punches from bot’ of ’em. Maybe dat’s what dey call hell, huh? But you, yuh’re at de bottom. You belong! Sure! Yuh’re de on’y one in de woild dat does, yuh lucky stiff! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The gorilla growls proudly.</i> And dat’s why dey gotter put yuh in a cage, see? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The gorilla roars angrily.</i> Sure! Yuh get me. It beats it when you try to tink it or talk it⁠—it’s way down⁠—deep⁠—behind⁠—you ’n’ me we feel it. Sure! Bot’ members of dis club! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">He laughs⁠—then in a savage tone.</i> What de hell! T’ hell wit it! A little action, dat’s our meat! Dat belongs! Knock ’em down and keep bustin’ ’em till dey croaks yuh wit a gat⁠—wit steel! Sure! Are yuh game? Dey’ve looked at youse, ain’t dey⁠—in a cage? Wanter git even? Wanter wind up like a sport ’stead of croakin’ slow in dere? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The gorilla roars an emphatic affirmative. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> goes on with a sort of furious exaltation.</i> Sure! Yuh’re reg’lar! Yuh’ll stick to de finish! Me ’n’ you, huh?⁠—bot’ members of this club! We’ll put up one last star bout dat’ll knock ’em offen deir seats! Dey’ll have to make de cages stronger after we’re trou! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The gorilla is straining at his bars, growling, hopping from one foot to the other. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> takes a jimmy from under his coat and forces the lock on the cage door. He throws this open.</i> Pardon from de governor! Step out and shake hands! I’ll take yuh for a walk down Fif’ Avenoo. We’ll knock ’em offen de oith and croak wit de band playin’. Come on, Brother. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The gorilla scrambles gingerly out of his cage. Goes to <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> and stands looking at him. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> keeps his mocking tone⁠—holds out his hand.</i> Shake⁠—de secret grip of our order. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Something, the tone of mockery, perhaps, suddenly enrages the animal. With a spring he wraps his huge arms around <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> in a murderous hug. There is a crackling snap of crushed ribs⁠—a gasping cry, still mocking, from <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b>.</i> Hey, I didn’t say, kiss me. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The gorilla lets the crushed body slip to the floor; stands over it uncertainly, considering; then picks it up, throws it in the cage, shuts the door, and shuffles off menacingly into the darkness at left. A great uproar of frightened chattering and whimpering comes from the other cages. Then <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Yank</b> moves, groaning, opening his eyes, and there is silence. He mutters painfully.</i> Say⁠—dey oughter match him⁠—wit Zybszko. He got me, aw right. I’m trou. Even him didn’t tink I belonged. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Then, with sudden passionate despair.</i> Christ, where do I get off at? Where do I fit in? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Checking himself as suddenly.</i> Aw, what de hell! No squakin’, see! No quittin’, get me! Croak wit your boots on! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">He grabs hold of the bars of the cage and hauls himself painfully to his feet⁠—looks around him bewilderedly⁠—forces a mocking laugh.</i> In de cage, huh? <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">In the strident tones of a circus barker.</i> Ladies and gents, step forward and take a slant at de one and only⁠—<i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">His voice weakening</i>⁠—one and original⁠—Hairy Ape from de wilds of⁠—<i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">He slips in a heap on the floor and dies. The monkeys set up a chattering, whimpering wail. And, perhaps, the Hairy Ape at last belongs.</i></td>
