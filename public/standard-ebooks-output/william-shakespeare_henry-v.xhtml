									<span>Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,</span>

									<span>That owe yourselves, your lives and services</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To this imperial throne. There is no bar</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To make against your highness’ claim to France</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But this, which they produce from Pharamond,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“<i xml:lang="la">In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant</i>:”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“No woman shall succeed in Salique land:”</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which Salique land the French unjustly glose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To be the realm of France, and Pharamond</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The founder of this law and female bar.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet their own authors faithfully affirm</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That the land Salique is in Germany,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There left behind and settled certain French;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who, holding in disdain the German women</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For some dishonest manners of their life,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Establish’d then this law; to wit, no female</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Should be inheritrix in Salique land:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which Salique, as I said, ’twixt Elbe and Sala,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is at this day in Germany call’d Meissen.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then doth it well appear the Salique law</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was not devised for the realm of France;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor did the French possess the Salique land</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until four hundred one and twenty years</span>
									<br/>
									<span>After defunction of King Pharamond,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Idly supposed the founder of this law;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who died within the year of our redemption</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Beyond the river Sala, in the year</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did, as heir general, being descended</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Make claim and title to the crown of France.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hugh Capet also, who usurp’d the crown</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To find his title with some shows of truth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Though, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Convey’d himself as the heir to the Lady Lingare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could not keep quiet in his conscience,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was reunited to the crown of France.</span>

									<span>Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To bar your highness claiming from the female,</span>

									<span>Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies</span>

									<span>The well-appointed king at Hampton pier</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Play with your fancies, and in them behold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,</span>
									<br/>

									<span>You stand upon the rivage and behold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A city on the inconstant billows dancing;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For so appears this fleet majestical,</span>

									<span>Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>With one appearing hair, that will not follow</span>

									<span>These cull’d and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Behold the ordnance on their carriages,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Tells Harry that the king doth offer him</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner</span>

For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a’ breaks words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath heard that men of few words are the best men; and therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a’ should be thought a coward: but his few bad words are matched with as few good deeds; for a’ never broke any man’s head but his own, and that was against a post when he was drunk. They will steal anything, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for three half-pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the men would carry coals. They would have me as familiar with men’s pockets as their gloves or their handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood, if I should take from another’s pocket to put into mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs.

I am afeard there are few die well that die in a battle; for how can they charitably dispose of anything, when blood is their argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it will be a black matter for the king that led them to it; who to disobey were against all proportion of subjection.</td>

Besides, there is no king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder; some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have defeated the law and outrun native punishment, though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to fly from God: war is his beadle, war is his vengeance; so that here men are punished for before-breach of the king’s laws in now the king’s quarrel: where they feared the death, they have borne life away; and where they would be safe, they perish: then if they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of their damnation than he was before guilty of those impieties for the which they are now visited. Every subject’s duty is the king’s; but every subject’s soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained: and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think that, making God so free an offer, He let him outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach others how they should prepare.</td>

If I could win a lady at leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my armour on my back, under the correction of bragging be it spoken, I should quickly leap into a wife. Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God, Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation; only downright oaths, which I never use till urged, nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love of anything he sees there, let thine eye be thy cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: if thou canst love me for this, take me; if not, to say to thee that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that can rhyme themselves into ladies’ favours, they do always reason themselves out again. What! a speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the moon; or rather the sun and not the moon; for it shines bright and never changes, but keeps his course truly. If thou would have such a one, take me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier, take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love? speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.</td>

								<span>The brightest heaven of invention,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A kingdom for a stage, princes to act</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leash’d in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Crouch for employment. But pardon, gentles all,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The flat unraised spirits that hath dared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So great an object: can this cockpit hold</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The vasty fields of France? or may we cram</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Within this wooden O the very casques</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That did affright the air at Agincourt?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O pardon! since a crooked figure may</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Attest in little place a million;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On your imaginary forces work.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Suppose within the girdle of these walls</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are now confined two mighty monarchies,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose high upreared and abutting fronts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into a thousand parts divide one man,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And make imaginary puissance;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Think, when we talk of horses, that you see them</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Printing their proud hoofs i’ the receiving earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ’tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Carry them here and there; jumping o’er times,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Turning the accomplishment of many years</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into an hourglass: for the which supply,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Admit me Chorus to this history;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></span>
