When you are hearing a matter between party and party, if you chance to be pinched with the colic, you make faces like mummers; set up the bloody flag against all patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot, dismiss the controversy bleeding, the more entangled by your hearing: all the peace you make in their cause is, calling both the parties knaves.

									<span>Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women</span>
									<br/>
									<span>’Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,</span>

									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To imitate the graces of the gods;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o’ the air,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>More bound to’s mother; yet here he lets me prate</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like one i’ the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life</span>

									<br/>
									<span>When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Has cluck’d thee to the wars and safely home,</span>

					<p>When the First Folio was first published, a deficiency was discovered in act two, scene three of this play. Due to Shakespeare’s close adherence to Plutarch’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Parallel Lives</i>, editors were able to develop a solution for this gap. The two most popular corrections for the missing content are:</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
