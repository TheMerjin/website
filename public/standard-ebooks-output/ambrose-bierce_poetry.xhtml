			<section id="black-beetles-in-amber-preface" epub:type="preface">
				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>Most of the verses in this volume are republished from newspapers and periodicals of the Pacific Coast. Naturally, the collection includes few not relating to persons and events more or less familiar to the people of that interesting region⁠—to whom, indeed, the volume may be considered as especially addressed, though not without a hope that its contents may be found to have a sufficient intrinsic interest to commend it to others.</p>
				<p>In answer to the familiar criticism that the author has dealt mostly with obscure persons, “unknown to fame,” he begs leave to point out that he has done what he could to lessen the force of the objection by dispelling some part of their obscurity and awarding them such fame as he was able to bestow. If the work meet with acceptance commentators will doubtless be “raised up” to give them an added distinction and make exposition of the circumstances through which they took attention, whereby the work will have a growing interest to those with the patience to wait.</p>
				<p>Further to fortify this apologia, I quote from my publishers the following relevant and judicious remarks on a kind of literature that is somewhat imperfectly understood in this night of its neglect:</p>
				<p>“In all the most famous satires in our language the victims would now be unknown were it not that they have been preserved ‘in amber’ by the authors. The enlightened lover of satire cares little of whom it was written, but much for what is said, and more for how it is said. No one but critics and commentators troubles himself as to the personality of the always obscure hero of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Dunciad</i> and the nobodies distinguished by the pens of Swift, Butler, Wolcott and the other masters of English satire; yet the work of these men is no less read than it was in their day. The same is true of Aristophanes, Horace and the other ancient censors of men and manners.”</p>
				<p>Regarding the repeated appearance of certain offenders in the skits and drolleries of this book, I can only say that during the considerable period covered by the author’s efforts to reclaim them they manifested a deplorable, and doubtless congenital, propensity to continuance in sin.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Avalon</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I dreamed I was dreaming one morn as I lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In a garden with flowers teeming⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On an island I lay, in a mystical bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the dream that I dreamed I was dreaming.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The ghost of a scent⁠—had it followed me there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the place where I truly was resting?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It filled like an anthem the aisles of the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The presence of roses attesting.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet I thought in the dream that I dreamed I dreamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the place was all barren of roses⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it only seemed; and the place, I deemed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the Isle of Bedeviled Noses.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Full many a seaman had testified</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How all who sailed near were enchanted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And landed to search (and in searching died)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the roses the Sirens had planted.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For the Sirens were dead, and the billows boomed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the stead of their singing forever;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the roses bloomed on the graves of the doomed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though man had discovered them never.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I thought in my dream ’twas an idle tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A delusion that mariners cherished⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the fragrance loading the conscious gale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the ghost of a garden long perished.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I said, “I will fly from this island of woes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And acting on that decision,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By that odor of rose I was led by the nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’twas truly, ah! truly, Elysian.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I ran, in my madness, to seek out the source</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the redolent river⁠—directed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By some supernatural, sinister force</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To a forest, dark, haunted, infected.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And still as I threaded (’twas all in the dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I dreamed I was dreaming) each turning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There were many a scream and a sudden gleam</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of eyes all uncannily burning!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The leaves were all wet with a horrible dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mirrored the red moon’s crescent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all shapes were fringed with a ghostly blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dim, wavering, phosphorescent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the fragrance divine, coming strong and free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Led me on in my resolute seeking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till⁠—ah, joy!⁠—I could see, on the limbs of a tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine enemies hanging and reeking!</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">An Obituarian</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A newspaper Death-poet sat at his desk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wrapped in appropriate gloom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His posture was pensive and picturesque,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a raven charming a tomb.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Enter a party a-drinking the cup</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sorrow⁠—and likewise of woe:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Some harrowing poetry, Mister, whack up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All wrote in the key of O.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For the angels have called my old woman hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the strife⁠—where she fit mighty free.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s a nickel a line? Cond⁠⸺⁠n the expense!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For wealth is now little to me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Bard of Mortality looked him through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the piercingest sort of a way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It is much to me though it’s little to you⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’ve <em>taken</em> a wife to-day.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So he twisted the tail of his mental cow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made her give down her flow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grief of that bard was long-winded, somehow⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There was reams and reamses of woe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The widower man which had buried his wife</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew lily-like round each gill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For she turned in her grave and came back to life!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he cruel ignored the bill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Sorrow she opened her gates a-wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As likewise did also Woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the death-poet’s song, as is heard inside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is sang in the key of O.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Boruck and Waterman upon their grills</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Hades lay, with many a sigh and groan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hotly disputing, for each swore his own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were clearly keener than the other’s ills.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, truly, each had much to boast of⁠—bone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sinew, muscle, tallow, nerve and skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blood in the vein and marrow in the shin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Teeth, eyes and other organs (for the soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has all of these and even a wagging chin)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All Blazed and coruscated like a coal!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Lower Sacramento, you remember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has trying weather, even in mid-December.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now this occurred in the far future. All</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mankind had been a million ages dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each to her reward above had sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each to his punishment below⁠—I call</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quite a just arrangement. As I said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Boruck and Waterman in warmest pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crackled and sizzed with all their might and main.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For, when on earth, they’d freed a scurvy host</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of crooks from the State prison, who again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had robbed and ravaged the Pacific Coast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And (such the felon’s predatory nature)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even got themselves into the Legislature.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So Waterman and Boruck lay and roared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Hades. It is true all other males</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Felt the like flames and uttered equal wails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But did not suffer <em>them</em>; whereas <em>they</em> bored</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one the other. But indeed my tale’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not getting on at all. They lay and browned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Boruck (who long since his teeth had ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Away and spoke Gum Arabic and made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stump speeches even in praying) looked around</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to Bob’s incinerated shade:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Your Excellency, this is mighty hard on</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The inventors of the unpardonable pardon.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The other soul⁠—his right hand all aflame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’twas with that he’d chiefly sinned, although</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His tongue, too, like a wick was working woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the reserve of tallow in his frame⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said, with a sputtering, uncertain flow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with a gesture like a shaken torch:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Yes, but I’m sure we’ll not much longer scorch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although this climate is not good for Hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose joyous wing ’twould singe, I think the porch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Hell we’ll quit with a pacific slope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Last century I signified repentance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked for commutation of our sentence.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Even as he spoke, the form of Satan loomed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In sight, all crimson with reflection’s fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like some tall tower or cathedral spire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touched by the dawn while all the earth is gloomed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In mists and shadows of the night time. “Sire,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said Waterman, his agitable wick</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still sputtering, “what calls you back so quick?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It scarcely was a century ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You left us.” “I have come to bring,” said Nick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s answer (he is never slow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In correspondence) to your application</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For pardon⁠—pardon me!⁠—for commutation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He says that he’s instructed to reply</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(And he has so instructed me) that sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like yours⁠—and this poor gentleman’s who’s in</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For bad advice to you⁠—comes rather high;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But since, apparently, you both begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To feel some pious promptings to the right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fain would turn your faces to the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternity seems all too long a term.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So ’tis commuted to one-half. I’m quite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prepared, when that expires, to free the worm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And quench the fire.” And, civilly retreating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He left them holding their protracted meeting.</span>

					<span>Before him yawned invisible the cell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unheard, behind, the warden’s footsteps fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thrice in convention rising to his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thrice had been thrust back into his seat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thrice had protested, been reminded thrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nation had no need of his advice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Balked of his will to set the people right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His soul was gloomy though his hat was white.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fierce his mien, with provident accord</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The waiters swarmed him, thinking him a lord.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spurned them, roaring grandly to their chief:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Give me (Fred Crocker pays) a leg of beef!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wandering eye’s deluminating flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell upon Gorham and the crisis came!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Pixley scowled and darkness filled the room</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Gorham’s flashing orbs dispelled the gloom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The patrons of the place, by fear dismayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sprang to the street and left their scores unpaid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, when Jove thunders and his lightnings gleam</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sour the milk and curdle, too, the cream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And storm-clouds gather, o’er the shadowed hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ass forsakes his hay, the pig his swill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hotly the heroes now fell to⁠—their breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came short and hard, as in the throes of death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They clenched their hands, their weapons brandished high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cut, stabbed, and hewed, nor uttered any cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But gnashed their teeth and struggled on! In brief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One ate his bacon, t’other one his beef.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Be pleased, O Lord, to take a people’s thanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Thine avenging sword has spared our ranks⁠—</span>

					<span>That thou hast parted from our lips the cup</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Father of Mercies, with a heart contrite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We thank Thee that Thou goest south to smite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sparest San Francisco’s loins, to crack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy lash on Hermosillo’s bleeding back⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That o’er our homes Thine awful angel spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wings in vain, and Guaymas weeps instead.</span>

					<span>Attest Thy bounty and perform Thy will.</span>

					<span>These native messengers obey Thy call⁠—</span>

					<span>They summon singly, but they summon all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not, as in Mexico’s impested clime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can Yellow Jack commit recurring crime.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We thank Thee that Thou killest all the time.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Thy tender mercies, Father, never end:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon all heads Thy blessings still descend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though their forms vary. Here the sown seeds yield</span>

					<span>Abundant grain that whitens all the field⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the smit corn stands barren on the plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thrift reaps the straw and Famine gleans in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here the fat priest to the contented king</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Points to the harvest and the people sing⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There mothers eat their offspring. Well, at least</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast provided offspring for the feast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An earthquake here rolls harmless through the land,</span>

					<span>And Thou art good because the chimneys stand⁠—</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Man</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Casting to South his eye across the bourne</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his dominion (where the Palmiped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With leathers ’twixt his toes, paddles his marsh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amphibious) saw a rising cloud of hats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard a faint, far sound of distant cheers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below the swell of the horizon. “Lo,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried one, “the President! the President!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All footed webwise then took up the word⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hill tribes and the tribes lacustrine⁠—all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk riparian and littoral,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried with one voice: “The President! He comes!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some there were who flung their headgear up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In emulation of the Southern mob,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While some, more soberly disposed, stood still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And silently had fits; and others made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such reverent genuflections as they could,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Having that climate in their bones. Then spake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Court Dunce, humbly, as became him: “Sire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou, as heretofore thou hast, wilt deign</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reap advantage of a fool’s advice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By action ordered after nature’s way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in thy people manifest (for still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stupidity’s the only wisdom) thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wilt get thee straight unto to the border land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mark the President’s approach with such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Due, decent courtesy as it shall seem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We have in custom the best warrant for.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eyeing the storm of hats which darkened all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Southern sky, and hearing far hurrahs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of an exulting people, answered not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then some there were who fell upon their knees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And some upon their Governor, and sought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each in his way, by blandishment or force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To gain his action to their end. “Behold,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They said, “thy brother Governor to South</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Met him even at the gateway of his realm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crook-kneed, magnetic-handed and agrin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Backed like a rainbow⁠—all things done in form</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of due observance and respect. Shall we</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone of all his servitors refuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swift welcome to our master and our lord?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answered them not, but turned his back to them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as if speaking to himself, the while</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He started to retire, said: “He be damned!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To that High Place o’er Portland’s central block,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the Recording Angel stands to view</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sinning world, nor thinks to move his feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aside and look below, came flocking up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inferior angels, all aghast, and cried:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Pennoyer, Governor of Oregon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has said, O what an awful word!⁠—too bad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be by us repeated!” “Yes, I know,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the superior bird⁠—“I heard it too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And have already booked it. Pray observe.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Splitting the giant tome, whose covers fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Apart, o’ershadowing to right and left</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Eastern and the Western world, he showed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The newly written entry, black and big⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the credit side of thine account,</span>

					<span>The moon in the field of the keel-plowed main</span>

					<span>A luminous peasant was driving his wain,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But I nourished a sorrow uncommonly tall,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>“O, peasant,” I sang with a dying fall,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The water was weltering round my feet,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>I chanted my death-song loud and sweet:</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then I heard the swish of erecting ears</span>

					<span class="i1">Which caught that enchanting strain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ocean was swollen with storms of tears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fell from the shining swain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O, poet,” leapt he to the soaken strand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That ravishing song would make</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The devil a saint!” He held out his hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And solemnly added: “Shake.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We shook. “I crave a victim, you see,”</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“You’ll sing no worser for that,” said he,</span>

				<p>
					<span>I stood upon a hill. The setting sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was crimson with a curse and a portent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And scarce his angry ray lit up the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That lay below, whose lurid gloom appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Freaked with a moving mist, which, reeking up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From dim tarns hateful with some horrid ban,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Took shapes forbidden and without a name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gigantic night-birds, rising from the reeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With cries discordant, startled all the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bodiless voices babbled in the gloom⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ghosts of blasphemies long ages stilled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shrieks of women, and men’s curses. All</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These visible shapes, and sounds no mortal ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had ever heard, some spiritual sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interpreted, though brokenly; for I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was haunted by a consciousness of crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some giant guilt, but whose I knew not. All</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These things malign, by sight and sound revealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were sin-begotten; that I knew⁠—no more⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that but dimly, as in dreadful dreams</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sleepy senses babble to the brain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imperfect witness. As I stood, a voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But whence it came I knew not, cried aloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some words to me in a forgotten tongue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet straight I knew me for a ghost forlorn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Returned from the illimited inane.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again, but in a language that I knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in reply to something which in me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had shaped itself a thought, but found no words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It spake from the dread mystery about:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Immortal shadow of a mortal soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That perished with eternity, attend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thou beholdest is as void as thou:</span>

					<span>As thou, his soul as thine, long dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not like thine outlasted by its shade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His dreams alone survive eternity</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As pictures in the unsubstantial void.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Excepting thee and me (and we because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The poet wove us in his thought) remains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of nature and the universe no part</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor vestige but the poet’s dreams. This dread,</span>

					<span>Unspeakable land about thy feet, with all</span>

					<span>’Tis but a phantom world. So long ago</span>

					<span>That God and all the angels since have died</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That poet lived⁠—yourself long dead⁠—his mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Filled with the light of a prophetic fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And standing by the Western sea, above</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The youngest, fairest city in the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Named in another tongue than his for one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ensainted, saw its populous domain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plague-smitten with a nameless shame. For there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Red-handed murder rioted; and there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people gathered gold, nor cared to loose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The assassin’s fingers from the victim’s throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But said, each in his vile pursuit engrossed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Am I my brother’s keeper? Let the Law</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look to the matter.’ But the Law did not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there, O pitiful! the babe was slain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within its mother’s breast and the same grave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Held babe and mother; and the people smiled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still gathering gold, and said: ‘The Law, the Law.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the great poet, touched upon the lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a live coal from Truth’s high altar, raised</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His arms to heaven and sang a song of doom⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang of the time to be, when God should lean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Indignant from the Throne and lift His hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that foul city be no more!⁠—a tale,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dream, a desolation and a curse!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No vestige of its glory should survive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fact or memory: its people dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its site forgotten, and its very name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disputed.”</span>

				<p>
					<span class="i3">“Was the prophecy fulfilled?”</span>

					<span>The sullen disc of the declining sun</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Freaked with a moving mist, which, reeking up</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And bodiless voices babbled in the gloom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not to me came any voice again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, covering my face with thin, dead hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wept, and woke, and cried aloud to God!</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Fall of Miss Larkin</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Hear me sing of Sally Larkin who, I’d have you understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Played accordions as well as any lady in the land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I’ve often heard it stated that her fingering was such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Professor Schweinenhauer was enchanted with her touch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that beasts were so affected when her apparatus rang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they dropped upon their haunches and deliriously sang.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This I know from testimony, though a critic, I opine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Needs an ear that is dissimilar in some respects to mine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She could sing, too, like a jaybird, and they say all eyes were wet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Sally and the ranch-dog were performing a duet⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which I take it is a song that has to be so loudly sung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to overtax the strength of any single human lung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, at least, would seem to follow from the tale I have to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which (I’ve told you how she flourished) is how Sally Larkin fell.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day there came to visit Sally’s dad as sleek and smart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A chap as ever wandered there from any foreign part.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though his gentle birth and breeding he did not at all obtrude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was somehow whispered round he was a simon-pure Dude.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Howsoe’er that may have been, it was conspicuous to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he was a real Gent of an uncommon high degree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Sally cast her tender and affectionate regards</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On this exquisite creation was, of course, upon the cards;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he didn’t seem to notice, and was variously blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To her many charms of person and the merits of her mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And preferred, I grieve to say it, to play poker with her dad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And acted in a manner that in general was bad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One evening⁠—’twas in summer⁠—she was holding in her lap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her accordion, and near her stood that melancholy chap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaning up against a pillar with his lip in grog imbrued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinking, maybe, of that ancient land in which he was a Dude.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Sally, who was melancholy too, began to hum</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And elongate the accordion with a preluding thumb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sighs of amorosity she painfully exhaled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her music apparatus sympathetically wailed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In the gloaming, O my darling!” rose that wild impassioned strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her eyes were fixed on his with an intensity of pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till the ranch-dog from his kennel at the postern gate came round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And going into session strove to magnify the sound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He lifted up his spirit till the gloaming rang and rang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the song that to <em>his</em> darling he impetuously sang!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then that musing youth, recalling all his soul from other scenes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where his fathers all were Dudes and his mothers all Dudines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From his lips removed the beaker and politely, o’er the grog,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said: “Miss Larkin, please be quiet: you will interrupt the dog.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Posterity’s Award</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I’d long been dead, but I returned to earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some small affairs posterity was making</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mess of, and I came to see that worth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Received its dues. I’d hardly finished waking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grave-mould still upon me, when my eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perceived a statue standing straight and high.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas a colossal figure⁠—bronze and gold⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nobly designed, in attitude commanding.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A toga from its shoulders, fold on fold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell to the pedestal on which ’twas standing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nobility it had and splendid grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all it should have had⁠—except a face!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It showed no features: not a trace nor sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of any eyes or nose could be detected⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the smooth oval of its front no line</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where sites for mouths are commonly selected.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All blank and blind its faulty head it reared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let this be said: ’twas generously eared.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Seeing these things, I straight began to guess</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whom this mighty image was intended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The head,” I cried, “is Upton’s, and the dress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is Parson Bartlett’s own.” True, <em>his</em> cloak ended</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flush with his lowest vertebra, but no</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sane sculptor ever made a toga so.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then on the pedestal these words I read:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<em>Erected Eighteen Hundred Ninety-seven</em>”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Saint Christofer! how fast the time had sped!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of course it naturally does in Heaven)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<em>To</em> ⸻” (here a blank space for the name began)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<em>The Nineteenth Century’s Great Foremost Man!</em>”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“<em>Completed</em>” the inscription ended, “<em>in</em></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><em>The Year Three Thousand</em>“⁠—which was just arriving.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By Jove! thought I, ’twould make the founders grin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To learn whose fame so long has been surviving⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To read the name posterity will place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that blank void, and view the finished face.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Even as I gazed, the year Three Thousand came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then by acclamation all the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Decreed whose was our century’s best fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then scaffolded the statue like a steeple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make the likeness; and the name was sunk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep in the pedestal’s metallic trunk.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whose was it? Gentle reader, pray excuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The seeming rudeness, but I can’t consent to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be so forehanded with important news.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twas neither yours nor mine⁠—let that content you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If not, the name I must surrender, which,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a dead man’s word, was Deacon Fitch!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Who are you?” asked <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter. Massett said:</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Opened the gates and said: “I’m glad to know you,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Don’t mention it,” said Stephen, looking bland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was about to enter, hat in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from a cloud below such fumes arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As tickled tenderly his conscious nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He paused, replaced his hat upon his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned back and to the saintly warden said,</span>

					<span>O’er his already sprouting wings: “I swear</span>

					<span>Strolling at sunset in my native land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fruits and flowers thick on either hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I crossed a Shadow flung athwart my way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Emerging on a waste of rock and sand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The apples all are gone from here,” I said,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Is risen who eternally was dead!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I turned and saw an angel standing there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Newly descended from the heights of air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sweet-eyed compassion filled his face, his hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A naked sword and golden trumpet bare.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, ’twas not death, the shadow that I crossed,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I said. “Its chill was but a touch of frost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It made me gasp, but quickly I came through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With breath recovered ere it scarce was lost.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas the same land! Remembered mountains thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grayed heads asky, and every dragging gust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In ashen valleys where my sons had reaped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stirred in familiar river-beds the dust.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Some heights, where once the traveler was shown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The youngest and the proudest city known,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifted smooth ridges in the steely light⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bleak, desolate acclivities of stone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Where I had worshiped at my father’s tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within a massive temple’s awful gloom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A jackal slunk along the naked rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Affrighted by some prescience of doom.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Man’s vestiges were nowhere to be found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save one brass mausoleum on a mound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(I knew it well) spared by the artist Time</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To emphasize the desolation round.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Into the stagnant sea the sullen sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sank behind bars of crimson, one by one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Eternity’s at hand!” I cried aloud.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Eternity,” the angel said, “is done.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For man is ages dead in every zone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The angels all are dead but I alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The devils, too, are cold enough at last,</span>

					<span>And God lies dead before the great white throne!</span>
				</p>

					<span>“ ’Tis foreordained that I bestride the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all are gone (as Gabriel did before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I had throttled the last man alive)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swear Eternity shall be no more.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O Azrael⁠—O Prince of Death, declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why conquered I the grave?” I cried. “What rare,</span>

					<span class="i1">Conspicuous virtues won this boon for me?”</span>

					<span>“You’ve been revived,” he said, “to hear me swear.”</span>

					<span>He rapped, and while the hollow echoes rang,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out at the door a curst hyena sprang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fled! Said Azrael: “His soul’s escaped,”</span>

					<span>What! Pixley, must I hear you call the roll</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the vices that infest your soul?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was’t not enough that lately you did bawl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your money-worship in the ears of all?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still must you crack your brazen cheek to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That though a miser you’re a sot as well?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still must I hear how low your taste has sunk⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From getting money down to getting drunk?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who worships money, damning all beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And shows his callous knees with pious pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaks with half-knowledge, for no man e’er scorns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His own possessions, be they coins or corns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ve money, neighbor; had you gentle birth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’d know, as now you never can, its worth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You’ve money; learning is beyond your scope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deaf to your envy, stubborn to your hope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if upon your undeserving head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Science and letters had their glory shed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If in the cavern of your skull the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of knowledge shone where now eternal night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Breeds the blind, poddy, vapor-fatted naughts</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of cerebration that you think are thoughts⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Black bats in cold and dismal corners hung</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That squeak and gibber when you move your tongue⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You would not write, in Avarice’s defense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A senseless eulogy on lack of sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor show your eagerness to sacrifice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All noble virtues to one loathsome vice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You’ve money; if you’d manners too you’d shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To boast your weakness or your baseness name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appraise the things you have, but measure not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The things denied to your unhappy lot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He values manners lighter than a cork</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who combs his beard at table with a fork.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hare to seek sin and tortoise to forsake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laws of taste condemn you to the stake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To expiate, where all the world may see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The crime of growing old disgracefully.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Distinction, learning, birth and manners, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that distinguishes a man from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pray damn at will: all shining virtues gain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An added luster from a rogue’s disdain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But spare the young that proselyting sin,</span>

					<span>A toper’s apotheosis of gin.</span>
					<br/>

				<p>
					<span>Are you not he who lately out of shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blew a brass trumpet to denounce the grape?⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who led the brave teetotalers afield</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Pray, in the catalogue of all your graces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have theft and cowardice no honored places?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yield thee, great Satan⁠—here’s a rival name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all thy vices and but half thy shame!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quick to the letter of the precept, quick</span>

					<span>To the example of the elder Nick;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With as great talent as was e’er applied</span>

					<span>To fool a teacher and to fog a guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With slack allegiance and boundless greed,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Bruce Douglas, nephew to a Scottish Earl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat in the City Prison, low in heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spirits. Round him lay the forms of men⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men of the people, of ignoble birth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prone or supine in sleep; but sleep and he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were out: the Douglas was too drunk for sleep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so he sat and moaned; and still his moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had all the cadences and stops of song⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Recurrent swells and measured silences</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which sought the ear as ocean’s billows roll,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At even spaces and with matching speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One after one ashore. Wherefore uprose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An old gray constable who in the morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And blossom of his life had courted fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As horse-reporter for a public print,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so was skilled in letters, and he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There to the sergeant, saying: “Surely, now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The man’s a poet. In his moan I hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pulsing and the passion of the sea⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hear the far beating of the waterfall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throbbing of noon-day insects in the grass⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All rhythmic movements of the universe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which poets echo in their thought and speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even in their inarticulate complaints</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of pain. My life I’ll hazard that the man’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bard disguised to look a gentleman.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, bringing his effects, which had till then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lain unconsidered⁠—from his pockets plucked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tossed aside⁠—all curiously they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Explored the papers. Odes and odes there were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every ode in praise of some fair scene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a fair land; and the fair land was this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our California. From the snowy peaks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That glitter in the skies of Siskiyou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down to the golden margin where the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slips underneath the San Diegan bay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from the dim Sierra, far across</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where old Ocean bears upon his breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Mongol horde returning to its own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its native land and its dear household gods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bruce Douglas, nephew of a Scottish Earl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had sung the beauty of the Golden State!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So then the Clerk, splitting the Book of Doom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Charged him therein with murder, arson, rape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Theft, libel, mayhem and intent to leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The State and so defraud his creditors⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With vagrancy, extortion and assault</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felonious, obtaining cash by false</span>

					<span>Pretenses⁠—with infanticide⁠—even him,</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">At the White House</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Among the notables one day that came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see the President was one whose name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was known from Puerto Rico to Luzon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although it wasn’t Smith nor even John.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Renowned in field and council too, for he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had tilled the soil and been a school trustee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Occasionally, just to pass the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He worked at patriotism and scowled at crime;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went up and down the land denouncing those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who loved him little as the country’s foes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Predicted famine when they scorned his story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for the ensuing harvest claimed the glory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His name indeed was famous, but because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My memory’s weak I know not what it was.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The President he came that day to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was as illustrious in his way as he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His name a household word⁠—that is to say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men damned him roundly to begin the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deplored him in the fireside’s rosy light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And grunted disesteem throughout the night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not all men⁠—some, the sons of pious mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prayed for him daily as upon him others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleek, snug, self-righteous, cunning as a rat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fish in fervor and in faith a cat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obscure by nature, he had ne’er been great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If Fortune had not kicked him into state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His name? Go ask Posterity, not me⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From words opprobrious my page is free.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So they were married⁠—no I mean they met;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For aught I know they are in session yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There in the White House, for each swore the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Belonged to him by God’s abounding grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, O, may He take measures to prevent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If both at once they would be President.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Old Nick from his place of last resort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came up and looked the world over.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw how the grass of the good was short</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the wicked lived in clover.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And he gravely said: “This is all, all wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And never by me intended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If to me the power ever belong</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I shall have this thing amended.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He looked so solemn and good and wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he made this observation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the men who heard him believed their eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of his reputation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So they bruited the matter about, and each</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reported the words as nearly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As memory served⁠—with additional speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring out the meaning clearly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The consequence was that none understood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the wildest rumors started</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of something intended to help the good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And injure the evil-hearted.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Robert Morrow was seen to smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a bright and lively joyance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A man,” said he, “that is free from guile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will now be free from annoyance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The Featherstones doubtless will now increase</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And multiply like the rabbits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While jailers, deputy sheriffs, police,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And writers will form good habits.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The widows more easily robbed will be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And no juror will ever heed ’em,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But open his purse to my eloquent plea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For security, gain, or freedom.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When Benson heard of the luck of the good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(He was eating his dinner) he muttered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It cannot help <em>me</em>, for ’tis understood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My bread is already buttered.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“My plats of surveys are all false, they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that cannot greatly matter</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me, for I’ll tell the jurors that they</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May lick, if they please, my platter.”</span>

					<span>The god of Bosh ascending from his pool,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where since creation he has played the fool,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clove the blue slush, as other gods the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, waiting but a moment’s space to dry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touched Bonynge with his finger-tip. “O son,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, “alike of nature and a gun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knowest not Mackay’s insufferable sin?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast thou not heard that he doth stand and grin?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arise! assert thy manhood, and attest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The uncommercial spirit in thy breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Avenge thine honor, for by Jove I swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt not else be my peculiar care!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He spake, and ere his worshiper could kneel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had dived into his slush pool, head and heel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full of the god and to revenges nerved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And conscious of a will that never swerved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bonynge set sail: our world beyond the wave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As gladly took him as the other gave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New York received him, but a shudder ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through all the western coast, which knew the man;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And science said that the seismic agitation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was due to mutable equilibration.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O goddess, sing what Bonynge next essayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did he unscabbard the avenging blade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long spear brandish and porrect the shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Havoc the town and devastate the field?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sacred thirst for blood did he allay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By halving the unfortunate Mackay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Small were the profit and the joy to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hew a base-born person, limb from limb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let vulgar souls to low revenge incline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That of diviner spirits is divine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bonynge at noonday stood in public places</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And (with regard to the Mackays) made faces!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before those formidable frowns and scowls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dogs fled, tail-tucked, with affrighted howls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And horses, terrified, with flying feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’erthrew the apple-stands along the street,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Involving the metropolis in vast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Financial ruin! Men themselves, aghast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Retreated east and west and north and south</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the menace of that twisted mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Jove, in answer to their prayers, sent Night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To veil the dreadful visage from their sight!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such were the causes of the horrid strife⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother-wrongs which nourished it to life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, for a quill from an archangel’s wing!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, for a voice that’s adequate to sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The splendor and the terror of the fray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The scattered hair, the coat-tails all astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parted collars and the gouts of gore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reeking and smoking on the banker’s floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The interlocking limbs, embraces dire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Revolving bodies and deranged attire!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Vain, vain the trial: ’tis vouchsafed to none</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sing two millionaires rolled into one!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My hand and pen their offices refuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hoarse and hoarser grows the weary muse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone remains, to tell of the event,</span>

					<span>Abandoned, lost and variously rent,</span>

					<span>Said he: “It is proper, when making a gift,</span>

					<span>To stimulate virtue by comforting thrift.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So he left all his property, legal and straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To “the cursedest rascal in all of the State.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the name he refused to insert, for, said he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let each man consider himself legatee.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In due course of time that philanthropist died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all San Francisco, and Oakland beside⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save only the lawyers⁠—came each with his claim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lawyers preferring to manage the same.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The cases were tried in Department Thirteen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Judge Murphy presided, sedate and serene,</span>

					<span>But couldn’t quite specify, legal and straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cursedest rascal in all of the State.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so he remarked to them, little and big⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To claimants: “You skip!” and to lawyers: “You dig!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They tumbled, tumultuous, out of his court</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And left him victorious, holding the fort.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas then that he said: “It is plain to my mind</span>

					<span>This property’s ownerless⁠—how can I find</span>

					<span>And out in space as far as Niles⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw their mortal parts in piles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One stack upreared its ridge so high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the azure of the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That some good soul, with pious views,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put up a steeple and sold pews.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No wagging tail the scene relieved:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never in my life conceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I swear it on the Decalogue!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such penury of living dog.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The barking and the howling stilled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The snarling with the snarler killed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All nature seemed to hold its breath:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silence was as deep as death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>True, candidates were all in roar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On every platform, as before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And villains, as before, felt free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To finger the calliope.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>True, the Salvationist by night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And milkman in the early light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lonely flutist and the mill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Performed their functions with a will.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>True, church bells on a Sunday rang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sick man’s curtain down⁠—the bang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of trains, contesting for the track,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the shadow called him back.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>True, cocks, at all unheavenly hours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crew with excruciating powers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cats on the woodshed rang and roared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fat citizens and fog-horns snored.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But this was all too fine for ears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accustomed, through the awful years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the nocturnal monologues</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And day debates of Oakland dogs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And so the world was silent. Now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What else befell⁠—to whom and how?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imprimis, then, there were no fleas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And days of worth brought nights of ease.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Men walked about without the dread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of being torn to many a shred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each fragment holding half a cruse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of hydrophobia’s quickening juice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They had not to propitiate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some curst kioodle at each gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But entered one another’s grounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unscared, and were not fed to hounds.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Women could drive and not a pup</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would lift the horse’s tendons up</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And let them go⁠—to interject</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A certain musical effect.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Even children’s ponies went about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All grave and sober-paced, without</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bulldog hanging to each nose⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proud of his fragrance, I suppose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dog being dead, Man’s lawless flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Burned out: he granted Woman’s claim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Children’s and those of country, art⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all took lodgings in his heart.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When memories of his former shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crimsoned his cheeks with sudden flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said; “I know my fault too well⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They fawned upon me and I fell.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah! ’twas a lovely world!⁠—no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I met that indisposing bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unseraphic cynogogue⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The man who’s proud to love a dog.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus in my dream the golden reign</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Reason filled the world again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all mankind confessed her sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Walnut Creek to San Jose.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“That’s awfully rough,” said the lady, “on me⁠—</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Vision of Resurrection</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I had a dream. The habitable earth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its continents and islands⁠—all was bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of cities and of forests. Naught remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of its old aspect, and I only knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(As men know things in dreams, unknowing how)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That this was earth and that all men were dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On every side I saw the barren land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even to the distant sky’s inclosing blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thick-pitted all with graves; and all the graves</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save one were open⁠—not as newly dug,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But rather as by some internal force</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Riven for egress. Tombs of stone were split</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wide agape, and in their iron decay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The massive mausoleums stood in halves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mildewed linen all the ground was white.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Discarded shrouds upon memorial stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hung without motion in the soulless air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While greatly marveling how this should be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard, or fancied that I heard, a voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Low like an angel’s, delicately strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweet as music.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i9">“Spirit,” it said, “behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The burial place of universal Man!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A million years have rolled away since here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sheeted multitudes (save only some</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose dark misdeeds required a separate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And individual arraigning) rose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To judgment at the trumpet’s summoning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And passed into the sky for their award,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaving behind these perishable things</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which yet, preserved by miracle, endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till all are up. Then they and all of earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rock-hearted mountain and storm-breasted sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>River and wilderness and sites of dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vanished capitals of men, shall spring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To flame, and naught shall be forevermore!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all are risen that wonder will occur.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas but ten centuries ago the last</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one came forth⁠—a soul so black with sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against whose name so many crimes were set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That only now his trial is at end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But one remains.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i8">Straight, as the voice was stilled⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That single rounded mound cracked lengthliwise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one came forth in grave-clothes. For a space</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He stood and gazed about him with a smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Superior; then laying off his shroud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disclosed his two attenuated legs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, like parentheses, bent outwardly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by the weight of saintliness above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so sprang upward and was lost to view.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Noting his headstone overthrown, I read:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sacred to memory of George <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">K.</abbr> Fitch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deacon and Editor⁠—a holy man</span>

					<span class="i1">I wonder if our future Grant or Sherman,</span>

					<span>As these youths pass their time, is passing his⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If eagles ever come from painted eggs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or deeds of arms succeed to deeds of legs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I know they tell us about Waterloo:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How, “foremost fighting,” fell the evening’s dancers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I don’t believe it: I regard it true</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That soldiers who are skillful in the Lancers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Less often die of cannon than of cancers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moreover, I am half-persuaded, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That David when he danced before the Ark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had the reporter’s word to keep it dark.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ed Greenway, you fatigue. Your hateful name</span>

					<span class="i1">Like maiden’s curls, is in the papers daily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You think it, doubtless, honorable fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And contemplate the cheap distinction gaily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As does the monkey the blue-painted tail he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Believes becoming to him. ’Tis the same</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With men as other monkeys: all their souls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crave eminence on any kind of poles.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But cynics (barking tribe!) are all agreed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That monkeys upon poles performing capers</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are not exalted, they are only “treed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A glory that is kindled by the papers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is transient as the phosphorescent vapors</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shine in graveyards and are seen, indeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But while the bodies that supply the gas</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are turning into weeds to feed an ass.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One can but wonder sometimes how it feels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To <em>be</em> an ass⁠—a beast we beat condignly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because, like yours, his life is in his heels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he is prone to use them unbenignly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ladies (bless them!) say you dance divinely.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I like <abbr>St.</abbr> Vitus better, though, who deals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His feet about him with a grace more just,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hops, not for he will, but for he must.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Doubtless it gratifies you to observe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Elbowy girls and adipose mamas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All looking adoration as you swerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way and that; but prosperous papas</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Laugh in their sleeves at you, and their ha-has,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If heard, would somewhat agitate your nerve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dames and maids who keep you on their shelves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Don’t seem to want a closer tie themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Gods! what a life you live!⁠—by day a slave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To your exacting back and urgent belly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Intent to earn and vigilant to save;</span>

					<br/>

					<span>Welcome, good friend; as you have served your term,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And found the joy of crime to be a fiction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hope you’ll hold your present faith, stand firm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not again be open to conviction.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Your sins, though scarlet once, are now as wool:</span>

					<span class="i1">You’ve made atonement for all past offenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And conjugated⁠—’twas an awful pull!⁠—</span>

					<span class="i1">The verb “to pay” in all its moods and tenses.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You were a dreadful criminal⁠—by Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think there never was a man so sinful!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ve all a pinch or two of Satan’s leaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But you appeared to have an even skinful.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Earth shuddered with aversion at your name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rivers fled backward, gravitation scorning;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea and sky, from thinking on your shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew lobster-red at eve and in the morning.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But still red-handed at your horrid trade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You wrought, to reason deaf, and to compassion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now with gods and men your peace is made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I beg you to be good and in the fashion.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What’s that?⁠—you “ne’er again will rob a stage”?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What! did you do so? Faith, I didn’t know it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was <em>that</em> what threw poor Themis in a rage?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I thought you were convicted as a poet!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I own it was a comfort to my soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And soothed it better than the deepest curses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To think they’d put one poet in a hole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where, though he wrote, he could not print his verses.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I thought that Welcker, Stuart, Brooks and all</span>

					<span class="i1">The ghastly crew who always are begriming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With villain couplets every page and wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might be arrested and “run in” for rhyming.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And then Parnassus would be left to me,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nor down a steep place run into the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As now he must be tempted to do daily.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well, grab the lyre-strings, hearties, and begin:</span>

					<span>’Tis sad, at your age, having to complain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of disillusion; but the fault is whose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When pigmies stumble, wearing giants’ shoes?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I humbly told you many moons ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For high preferment you were all unfit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A clumsy bear makes but a sorry show</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Climbing a pole. Let him, judicious, sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With dignity at bottom of his pit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And none his awkwardness will ever know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some beasts look better, and feel better, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seen from above; and so, I think, would you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why, you were mad! Did you suppose because</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our foolish system suffers foolish men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To climb to power, make, enforce the laws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, it is whispered, break them now and then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We love the fellows and respect them when</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ve stilled the volume of our loud hurrahs?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When folly blooms we trample it the more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For having cultivated it before.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Behold yon laborer! His garb is mean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His face is grimy, but who thinks to ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The measure of his brains? ’Tis only seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He’s fitted for his honorable task,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so delights the mind. But let him bask</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In droll prosperity, absurdly clean⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is that the man whom we admired before?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good Lord, how ignorant, and what a bore!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Better for you that thoughtless men had said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Noting your fitness in the humbler sphere):</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why don’t they make him Governor?” instead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of, “Why the devil did they?” But I fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My words on your inhospitable ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are wasted like a sermon to the dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still, they may profit you if studied well:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You can’t be taught to think, but may to spell.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Whence smiling innocence, its tribute paid,</span>

					<span>Dear lovely bowers of gossip and disease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose climate cures us that thy dames may tease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How often have I knelt upon thy green</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And prayed for death, to mitigate their spleen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How often have I paused on every charm</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mingled admiration and alarm⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The brook that runs by many a scandal-mill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The church whose pastor groans upon the grill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cowthorn bush with seats beneath the shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where hearts are struck and reputations flayed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How often wished thine idle wives, some day,</span>

					<span>Might more at whist, less at the devil, play.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unblest retirement! ere my life’s decline</span>

					<span>(Killed by detraction) may I witness thine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How happy she who, shunning shades like these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Finds in a wolf-den greater peace and ease;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who quits the place whence truth did earlier fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And rather than come back prefers to die!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For her no jealous maids renounce their sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Contriving malices to make her weep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No iron-faced dames her character debate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spurn imploring mercy from the gate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But down she lies to a more peaceful end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For wolves do not calumniate, but rend⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sinks piecemeal to their maws, a willing prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While resignation lubricates the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her prospects brighten at the last:</span>

					<span>So, Estee, you are still alive! I thought</span>

					<span>Society more pleasant than our own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In our brief respites from excessive work⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pointing out the hearts for you to dirk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What have you done since lately at this board</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We canvassed the deserts of all the horde,</span>

					<span>And chose what names would please the people best,</span>

					<span>Would give more satisfaction if at rest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But never mind⁠—the record cannot fail:</span>

					<br/>

					<br/>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Woeful Tale of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I should like, good friends, to mention the disaster that befell</span>
					<br/>
					<span><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose fate is full of meaning if correctly understood⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Admonition to the haughty, consolation to the good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It happened in the hot snap which we recently incurred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When ’twas warm enough to carbonize the feathers of a bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And men exclaimed: “By Hunky!” who were bad enough to swear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pious persons supervised their adjectives with care.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters was a pedagogue of honor and repute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His learning comprehensive, multifarious, minute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was commonly conceded in the section whence he came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the man who played against him needed knowledge of the game.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And some there were who whispered, in the town of Muscatel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That besides the game of Draw he knew Orthography as well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though, the school directors, frigidly contemning that as stuff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thought that Draw (and maybe Spelling, if he had it) was enough.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Withal, he was a haughty man⁠—indubitably great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But too vain of his attainments and his power in debate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mien was contumelious to men of lesser gift:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It’s only <em>me</em>,” he said, “can give the human mind a lift.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Before a proper audience, if ever I’ve a chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll see me chipping in, the cause of Learning to advance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just let me have a decent chance to back my mental hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I’ll come to center lightly in a way they’ll understand.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such was William Perry Peters, and I feel a poignant sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of grief that I’m unable to employ the present tense;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Providence disposes, be our scheming what it may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And disposed of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters in a cold, regardless way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It occurred in San Francisco, whither <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the cause of Education, feeling still the holy flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ambition to assist in lifting up the human mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To a higher plane of knowledge than its Architect designed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He attended the convention of the pedagogic host;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was first in the Pavilion, he was last to leave his post.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For days and days he narrowly observed the Chairman’s eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His efforts ineffectual to catch it on the fly.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The blessed moment came at last: the Chairman tipped his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The gentleman from ah⁠—um⁠—er,” that functionary said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gentleman from ah⁠—um⁠—er reflected with a grin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“They’ll know me better by-and-by, when I’m a-chipping in.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So William Perry Peters mounted cheerfully his feet⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And straightway was aglow with an incalculable heat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His face was as effulgent as a human face could be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And caloric emanated from his whole periphery;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For he felt himself the focus of non-Muscatelish eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the pain of their convergence was a terror and surprise!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As with pitiless appulsion all their heat-waves on him broke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was seen to be evolving awful quantities of smoke!</span>

					<span>Well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Kemble, you are called, I think,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A great divine, and I’m a great profane.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You as a Congregationalist blink</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some certain truths that I esteem a gain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drop them in the coffers of my brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pleased with the pretty music of their chink.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps your spiritual wealth is such</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A golden truth or two don’t count for much.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You say that you’ve no patience with such stuff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by Rénan is writ, and when you read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Why do you read?) have hardly strength enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To hold your hand from flinging the vile screed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the fire. That were a wasteful deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which you’d repent in sackcloth extra rough;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For books cost money, and I’m told you care</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lay up treasures Here as well as There.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I fear, good, pious soul, that you mistake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your thrift for toleration. Never mind:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rénan in any case would hardly break</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His great, strong, charitable heart to find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bats and owls of your myopic kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pained by the light that his ideas make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis Truth’s best purpose to shine in at holes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where cower the Kembles, to confound their souls!</span>

				<p>
					<span>We journey forward through the time allowed,</span>

					<span>I humbly bending, you erect and proud.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our heads alike will stable soon the worm⁠—</span>

					<span>The one that’s lifted, and the one that’s bowed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You in your mausoleum shall repose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I where it pleases Him who sleep bestows;</span>

				<p>
					<span>Charles Main, I had a friend who died one day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A metal casket held his honored clay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cyclopean architecture stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The splendid vault where he was laid away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A dozen years, and lo! the roots of grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had burst asunder all the joints; the brass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gilded ornaments, the carven stones</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay tumbled all together in a mass.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A dozen years! That taxes your belief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make it a thousand if the time’s too brief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twill be the same to you; when you are dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You cannot even count your days of grief.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Suppose a pompous monument you raise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till on its peak the solar splendor blaze</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While yet about its base the night is black;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But will it give your glory length of days?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Say, when beneath your rubbish has been thrown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some rogue to reputation all unknown⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Men’s backs being turned⁠—should lift his thieving hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Efface your name and substitute his own,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whose then would be the monument? To whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would be the fame? Forgotten in your gloom⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your very name forgotten⁠—ah, my friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The name is all that’s rescued by the tomb.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For memory of worth and work we go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To other records than a stone can show.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These lacking, naught remains; with these</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stone is needless for the world will know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then build your mausoleum if you must,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And creep into it with a perfect trust;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in the twinkling of an eye the plow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall pass without obstruction through your dust.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Another movement of the pendulum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, lo! the desert-haunting wolf shall come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, seated on the spot, shall howl by night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er rotting cities, desolate and dumb.</span>

					<span>One day when Satan visited the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In order that his eyes might feed his mirth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A loyal follower in sorrow said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Father of Falsehood, to our idols wed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We rear memorials in bronze and stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every kind of mortal greatness known;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not in this thy realm stands anywhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A monument or statue to declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy greater glory.” With the modest mien</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of violet that loves to bloom unseen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Satan replied: “All earthly fame I shun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Content with consciousness of work well done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Statues to heroes! Mine the humble glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell on every pedestal the story.”</span>

					<span>Mahatma Holden, Autocrat of Stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fixed to the telescope his curious eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And waited for some great phenomenon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To seek his field of vision. Years and years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Retiring early, rising with the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With patience proof against defeat, he still</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had sought some grand discovery; and still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dogging the footsteps of endeavor, came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grim disappointment and in mockery</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Derided him. But now, even as he gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A great white light crept up the sky, and lo!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the telescope’s illumined ken</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swam with a stately grace a noble orb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And paused in mid-field of the mighty tube!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mahatma Holden, Autocrat of Stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was found next morn beneath the instrument,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Senseless and motionless as one that’s dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By some emotion overcome,” said one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Sometime physician to the Ghug of Smat)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who with sharp stimulants and kindly words</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strove to revive him. Scarcely had the fresh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wholesome air saluted both his lungs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than, “Paper!” cried he⁠—“paper, pen and ink!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quick, ere the glorious memory fades! Ah, friends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not all in vain my vigils and my skill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To read the secrets of the upper deep:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last I’m famous and my name shall ring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adown the centuries unlinked with theirs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My menials, Burnham, Bar⁠—” he faltered then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet with a mighty effort peaced himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mastered his spirit, calmly gazed about</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, with angelic dignity, explained:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’ve found the Moon!” And it was even so.</span>

					<span>Once⁠—in the county of Marin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where milk is sold to purchase gin⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Renowned for butter and renowned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For fourteen ounces to the pound⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bull stood watching every turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wilson with a churn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As that deigning worthy stalked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About him, eying as he walked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>El Toro’s sleek and silken hide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His neck, his flank and all beside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinking with secret joy: “I’ll spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This mammal on a slice of bread!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wilson’s keen concern</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To get the creature in his churn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unhorsed his caution⁠—made him blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the fell vigor of bullkind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, filled with valor to the teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He drew his dasher from its sheath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bravely brandished it; the while</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He smiled a dark, portentous smile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A deep, sepulchral smile; a wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And open smile, which, at his side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The churn to copy vainly tried;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A smile so like the dawn of doom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all the field was palled in gloom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the trees within a mile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As tribute to that awful smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made haste, with loyalty discreet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fling their shadows at his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rose his battle-cry: “I’ll spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This mammal on a slice of bread!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To such a night the day had turned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Taurus dimly was discerned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wore so meek and grave an air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed as if, engaged in prayer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This thunderbolt incarnate had</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No thought of anything that’s bad:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This concentrated earthquake stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave his mind to being good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lightly and low he drew his breath⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This magazine of sudden death!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All this the thrifty Wilson’s glance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Took in, and, crying, “Now’s my chance!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the bull he sprang amain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To put him in his churn. Again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rang out his battle-yell: “I’ll spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This mammal on a slice of bread!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sing, Muse, that battle-royal⁠—sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deeds that made the region ring:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blows, the bellowing, the cries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dust that darkened all the skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thunders of the contest, all!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, none of these things did befall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A yell there was⁠—a rush⁠—no more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>El Toro, tranquil as before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still stood there basking in the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor of his legs had shifted one⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood there and conjured up his cud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And meekly munched it. Scenes of blood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had little charm for him. His head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He merely nodded as he said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’ve spread that butterman upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A slice of Southern Oregon.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Genesis of Crime</h3>
				<p>
					<span>God said, “Let there be Crime,” and the command</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brought Satan, leading Stoneman by the hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why, that’s Stupidity, not Crime,” said God⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Bring what I ordered.” Satan with a nod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied, “This is <em>one</em> element⁠—when I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The <em>other</em>⁠—Opportunity⁠—supply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In just equivalent, the two’ll affine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in a chemical embrace combine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Crime result⁠—for Crime can only be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stupiditate of Opportunity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So leaving Stoneman (not as yet endowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With soul) in special session on a cloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nick to his sooty laboratory went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Returning soon with t’other element.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Here’s Opportunity,” he said, and put</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pen, ink, and paper down at Stoneman’s foot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He seized them⁠—Heaven was filled with fires and thunders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Crime was added to Creation’s wonders!</span>

					<span>My ventures all miscarrying⁠—naught had</span>

				<p>
					<span>They say, George Perry, you’re a lawyer. Well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At least that’s your profession, but in fact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Law’s like religion (though, the truth to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The likeness is not otherwise exact)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this, that in them both, my learned brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Profession’s one thing, practice quite another.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But you do practice, for the other day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw you mentioned in a case in court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cross-questioning a witness. I must say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You did it as a cat that loves to sport</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With an unworthy mouse all too unwilling</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To accept the justice of repeated killing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This witness, so the tale is told to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fatigued of your attempt upon his life⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean his reputation⁠—made him free</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With yours, affirming that you beat your wife.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If that is true (they say that it upset you)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She must be monstrous cowardly to let you!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You hold it right to torture men who come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(Heaven knows unwillingly) to aid the law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that by terror of your tongue made dumb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They can’t tell rightly what they heard or saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Impeaching credibility,” you call it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, seeing an honest looking head, you maul it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Well, witnesses are fallible⁠—involved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes in scandals; and ’tis true that they</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are factors in the problem to be solved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The judge and jury led by what they say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lawyers⁠—they are factors too, their problem</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Being foolish clients and how best to rob them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They’ve more to say than witnesses, and more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Important ’tis that they be truthful, too.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were’t not, then, right the witness take the floor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mercilessly cross-examine <em>you</em>?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were truth your jewel (bless us! what a setting!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve certain questions that would set you sweating!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nay, don’t be fidgeting; to ask them here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were perilous, for I no license hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be a blackguard; and no judge is near</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To jail you for replies too sharp and bold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besides, it were no easy task to shame you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And till I’m paid a fee I’ll not defame you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You see I lack advantages that you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Possess, and therefore cannot be so brave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who has, and uses, them’s respected; who</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has not, yet bullies, is a scurril knave⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though, faith, the difference is narrow, very,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which a knave’s distinguished from a Perry.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You served, if rightly I remember, once</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A term in the State Legislature, where</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You figured merely as a harmless dunce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save when, ambitious, in the larger air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of rhetoric you held the floor a season</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give yourself for sin sufficient reason.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus a great bird whose nature is in doubt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With difficulty rises from the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His wide wings spreading with an effort out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shows by his unconscionable girth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’er yet the agitated air insult your</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resentful nose, he’s but a glutted vulture.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Touching these matters I would fain inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I but had you on the witness-grill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the slow but efficacious fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cross-examination; and I’d kill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The worm with quite insensible gradation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And quench the fire with great deliberation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What, you’re no worse than other lawyers? Well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I never said you were, my little man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you suppose I run this private Hell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one small soul? ’Tis your entire clan</span>

					<span>I’m trying to barbecue, despite their pleadings.</span>

					<span>The Devil one day, coming up from the Pit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All grimy with perspiration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Applied to Saint Peter and begged he’d admit</span>

				<p>
					<span>The Saint showed him in where the Master reclined</span>

					<span class="i1">On the throne where petitioners sought him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both bowed, and the Evil One opened his mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concerning the business that brought him:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For ten million years I’ve been kept in a stew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because you have thought me immoral;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And though I have had my opinion of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You’ve had the best end of the quarrel.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But now⁠—well, I venture to hope that the past</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With its misunderstandings we’ll smother;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you, sir, and I, sir, be throned here at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As equals, the one to the other.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Indeed!” said the Master (I cannot convey</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sense of his tone by mere letters)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What makes you presume you’ll be bidden to stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up here on such terms with your betters?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Why, sure you can’t mean it!” said Satan. “I’ve seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How Stanford and Crocker you’ve nourished,</span>

					<span>And Huntington⁠—bless me! the three like a green</span>

					<span>It matters very little, though, my boy,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Fling falsehoods as a sower scatters grain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, for security, invoke disdain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sir, there are laws that men of sense observe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No matter whence they come nor whom they serve⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laws of courtesy; and these forbid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You to malign, as recently you did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As servant of another State, a State</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein your duties all are concentrate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Branding its Ministers as rogues⁠—in short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inviting cuffs as suitable retort.</span>

					<span>Dear Bruner, once we had a little talk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(That is to say, ’twas I did all the talking)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About the manner of your moral walk:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How devious the trail you made in stalking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On level ground, your law-protected game⁠—</span>

					<span>“Another’s Dollar” is, I think, its name.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Your crooked course more recently is not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So blamable; for, truly, you have stumbled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On evil days; and ’tis your luckless lot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To traverse spaces (with a spirit humbled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Contrite, dejected and divinely sad)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where, ’tis confessed, the walking’s mighty bad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Jordan, the song says, is a road (I thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was a river) that is hard to travel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dublin, if you’d find it, must be sought</span>

					<span class="i1">Along a highway with more rocks than gravel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In difficulty neither can compete</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With that wherein you navigate your feet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As once George Gorham said of Pixley, so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say of you: “The prison yawns before you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The turnkey stalks behind!” Now will you go?</span>

					<span>So, Hall McAllister, you’ll not be warned⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And raised the cry upon him, he to-day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would lack your company, and you would lack his pay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Talk not of “hire” and consciences for sale⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You whose profession ’tis to threaten, rail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Calumniate and libel at the will</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>To you ’tis one, to challenge or defend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clients are means, their money is an end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In my profession sometimes, as in yours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always, a payment large enough secures</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A mercenary service to defend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The guilty or the innocent to rend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But mark the difference, nor think it slight:</span>
					<br/>
					<span><em>We</em> do not hold it proper, just and right;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of selfish lies a little still we shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And give our villainies another name.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hypocrisy’s an ugly vice, no doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But blushing sinners can’t get on without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Happy the lawyer!⁠—at his favored hands</span>

					<span>His brains for sale, morality for hire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every land and century a licensed liar!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No doubt, McAllister, you can explain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How honorable ’tis to lie for gain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Provided only that the jury’s made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To understand that lying is your trade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hundred thousand volumes, broad and flat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The Bible not included) proving that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have been put forth, though still the doubt remains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If God has read them with befitting pains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No Morrow could get justice, you’ll declare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If none who knew him foul affirmed him fair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ingenious man! how easy ’tis to raise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An argument to justify the course that pays!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I grant you, if you like, that men may need</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The services performed for crime by greed⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grant that the perfect welfare of the State</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Requires the aid of those who in debate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As mercenaries lost in early youth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fine distinction between lie and truth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who cheat in argument and set a snare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take the feet of Justice unaware⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who serve with livelier zeal when rogues assist</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With perjury, embracery (the list</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is long to quote) than when an honest soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scorning to plot, conspire, intrigue, cajole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reminds them (their astonishment how great!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’d rather suffer wrong than perpetrate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I grant, in short, ’tis better all around</span>

					<span>With others of the shrouded throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In San Mateo⁠—carted there</span>

					<span>One’s back-bone with another’s shin,</span>

					<span>A third one’s skull with a fourth one’s grin⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your eye was never, never fixed</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Go now among them there and blow:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twill be as good as any show</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see them, when they hear the tones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compiling one another’s bones!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But here ’tis vain to sound and wait:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Naught rises here but real estate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I own it all and shan’t disgorge.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Saint Peter, standing at the Gate, beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A soul whose body Death had lately felled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A pleasant soul as ever was, he seemed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His step was joyous and his visage beamed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Good morning, Peter.” There was just a touch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of foreign accent, but not overmuch.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Saint bent gravely, like a stately tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “You have the advantage, sir, of me.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Rénan of Paris,” said the immortal part⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A master of the literary art.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I’m somewhat famous, too, I grieve to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As controversialist and infidel.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“That’s of no consequence,” the Saint replied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why, I myself my Master once denied.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“No one up here cares anything for that.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But is there nothing you were always at?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“It seems to me you were accused one day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of <em>something</em>⁠—what it was I can’t just say.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Quite likely,” said the other; “but I swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My life was irreproachable and fair.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Just then a soul appeared upon the wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing a hymn as loud as he could bawl.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>About his head a golden halo gleamed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As well befitted one of the redeemed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A harp he bore and vigorously thumbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strumming he sang, and, singing, ever strummed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His countenance, suffused with holy pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Glowed like a pumpkin with a light inside.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah! that’s the chap,” said Peter, “who declares:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Rénan’s a rake and drunkard⁠—smokes and swears.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yes, that’s the fellow⁠—he’s a preacher⁠—came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From San Francisco. Mansfield was his name.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Do you believe him?” said Rénan. “Great Scott!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Believe? Believe the blackguard? Of course <em>not</em>!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Just walk right in and make yourself at home.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he pecks at you I’ll cut his comb.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“He’s only here because the Devil swore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wouldn’t have him, for the smile he wore.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Resting his eyes one moment on that proof</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of saving grace, the Frenchman turned aloof,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And stepping down from cloud to cloud, said he:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thank you, monsieur⁠—I’ll see if he’ll have <em>me</em>.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Rose up his figure for to speak:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Please, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Chair, I’m holding here</span>

					<span>A resolution which, I fear,</span>

				<p>
					<span>“No sooner was he seated than</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Each chap was primed with a reply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tried to snatch the Chairman’s eye.</span>

					<span>They stomped and shook their fists in air,</span>

					<span>And, O, what words was uttered there!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The Chair was silent, but at last</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hove up his proportions vast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stilled them tumults with a look</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which the undauntedest was shook.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He smiled sarcastical and said:</span>

					<span>‘If Argus was the Chair, instead</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Might maybe undertake to do</span>

					<span>Each other harm before you cease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve took some steps to keep the peace:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve ordered out⁠—alas, alas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Science e’er to such a pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should come!⁠—I’ve ordered out⁠—the gas!’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O if a tongue or pen of fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was mine I could not tell entire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What the ensuin’ actions was!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When swollered up in darkness’ jaws</span>

				<p>
					<span>Smit with a reverential awe,</span>

					<span>The great man’s figure there I saw.</span>

					<span>Legs crossed, arms folded and head bare.</span>

				<p>

				<p>
					<span>Had ever on a golden throne</span>

					<span>The giant telescope, reversed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed diving from the sky head first!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Its broader end remained at rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within two yards of Holden’s breast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O mighty scientist,” I cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let me beneath this dome abide.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The night is bad, and o’er your roof</span>

					<span>Seven crazy planets are aloof.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The trails are terrors to my shanks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dread the planetary pranks!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He deigned no word, but gave the nod.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That sign of an assenting god.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Meantime the telescope’s great eye</span>

				<p>
					<span>“ ’Tis little that I know of stars,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That if they have not “Faith,” they’ll go</span>
					<br/>

					<span>This dime I cannot, though I try,</span>

					<span>No doubt the happiness is great</span>

					<span>“By heaven!” he swore; “not only will I build,</span>

					<span>But purchase donkeys till the place is filled!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Needless expense,” they sneered in tones of ice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The owner’s self, if lodged there, would suffice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For three long months the awful war they waged:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With women, women, men with men engaged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While roaring babes and shrilling poodles raged!</span>

				<p>
					<span>Jove, from Olympus, where he still maintains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His ancient session (with rheumatic pains</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Touched by his long exposure) marked the strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interminable but by loss of life;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For malediction soon exhausts the breath⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If not, old age itself is certain death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! he holds high in heaven the fatal beam;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A golden pan depends from each extreme;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One feels of Porter’s fate the downward stress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One bears the destiny of all Van Ness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alas! the rusted scales, their life all gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deliver judgment neither pro nor con:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dooms hang level and the war goes on.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a divine, contemptuous disesteem</span>

					<span>Jove dropped the pans and kicked, himself, the beam:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, to decide the strife, with ready wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nickel that he did not care for it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twirled absently, remarking: “See it spin:</span>

					<span>Head, Porter loses; tail, the others win.”</span>

					<span>The conscious nickel, charged with doom, spun round,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Then, staggering beneath its load of fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sank rattling, died at last and lay in state.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Jove scanned the disk and then, as is his wont,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Raised his considering orbs, exclaiming: “Front!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With leisurely alacrity approached</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The herald god, to whom his mind he broached:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In San Francisco two belligerent Powers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as contended round great Ilion’s towers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fight for a stable, though in either class</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s not a horse, and but a single ass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Achilles Ashe, with formidable jaw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Assails a Trojan band with fierce hee-haw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Firing the night with brilliant curses. They</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With dark vituperation gloom the day.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With haste, good Mercury, betake thee hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And salivate him till he has no sense!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sheer downward shot the messenger afar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trailing a splendor like a falling star!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With dimming lustre through the air he burned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vanished, but with another sun returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sovereign of the gods superior smiled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beaming benignant, fatherly and mild:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Is Destiny’s decree performed, my lad?⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These many years of editoring? Why, it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seems hardly credible that you have made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So little, working at so good a trade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why, bless you! there is Mike de Young, a man⁠—</span>
					<br/>

					<span>He’s famous from the water-front to San</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He’s rich! Among the things he’s proved to own</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are half a million dollars and Frank Stone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So rich is he that many persons swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He ought as Senator to be elected.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’s rich enough to want the earth and air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although not rich enough to be respected.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You say that’s nothing to the purpose. True,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I meant to sing about, not him, but you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You’re hardly worth it, maybe: he who scorns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His opportunities of gain by mounting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then dismounting, other person’s corns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discredits journalism. There’s no accounting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For tastes; no doubt you think yourself as good</span>

					<span>As if in mail of black you proudly stood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do not think you so⁠—the rich are best.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>(What fowl so meditative on the nest⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So introspective as the glutted vulture?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Our Mike” is noble, I’m persuaded⁠—nay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’ll tell you so himself ten times a day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He <em>will</em> slip in: I can’t at all prevent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His reasonless and seasonless intrusion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wish that, like <abbr>Mo.</abbr> Gunst, the wretch “had went.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come, Deacon, let us drink to his confusion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On second thoughts, I can’t afford, I think⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No more can you⁠—to buy befitting drink.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, well, in all these long, contentious years</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis many an ill turn we’ve done each other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You ne’er could altogether stay your sneers,</span>

					<span class="i1">Nor I regard you as an elder brother.</span>

					<span>You every way invited my dislike,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Excepting by comparison with Mike.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The cause of quarrel (now at end of war</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hatchet we’ll inter and marble-slab it)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was plain to either adversary, for</span>

					<span>If there was aught behind I know not⁠—<em>that</em></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Explains full twenty years of dog-and-cat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, as you leave the field, let me be frank:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excepting various errors of the noddle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as made talk of “caving down the bank,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lately a bad flow of Sandlot twaddle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And always a bat’s blindness to my worth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your record’s clean and laudable from birth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fitch, here’s my hand; my heart is in it, too.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(That organ’s somewhat out of shape, however,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From use in football.) Really, ’twould not do</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our long relation sullenly to sever.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon comes the silence. May we then be laid</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Well, Towser (I’m thinking your name must be Towser),</span>

					<span class="i1">You’re a decentish puppy as puppy dogs go,</span>

					<span>But, dear me! your name⁠—if ’tis yours⁠—is a “poser”:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its meaning I cannot get anywise at,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When spoken correctly perhaps it is Toser,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And means one who toses. Max Muller, how’s that?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I ne’er was ingenious at all at divining</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A word’s prehistorical, primitive state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or finding its root, like a mole, by consigning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its bloom to the turnip-top’s sorrowful fate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And, now that I think of it well, I’m no nearer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The riddle’s solution than ever⁠—for how’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My pretty invented word, “tose,” any clearer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In point of its signification than “towse”?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, Towser (or Toser), I mean to rename you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In honor of some good and eminent man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the light and the heat of whose quickening fame you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May grow to an eminent dog if you can.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In sunshine like his you’ll not long be a croucher:</span>

					<span>Come here, sir. Stand up. I rechristen you Goucher.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Oh, deem it not presumption, Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In me to revise Thy holy Word⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No jot or tittle I’d efface,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No menace dire, nor pledge of grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No poetry I’d blot (although it’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well known to Thee that I hate poets),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But humbly, reverently try</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some missing mandates to supply.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For lo! I fall of dunces ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who’ve got by heart Thy written will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turn, behold! in tears away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From rogues Thy bidding who obey.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherever “Thou shalt not” occurs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d add “Thou shalt the exact reverse,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And many a virtue, too, compel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(By plain command and threat of hell)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which has no corresponding vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To interdict in terms precise.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Men Bible-clear, who ought to smart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the lash at tail of cart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each soul (masks, too, would then be thinner)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If not a saint, should be a sinner.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In error, Lord, if I am found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Observe how clouds my vision bound:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forgive my narrowness of sight,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Stanford, when recently you gave Tom Fitch</span>

					<span>(A circumstance of no importance, which</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the grand jury) did you calculate</span>

					<br/>
					<span>’Twere better, sir, to cast your bread-and-butter</span>

					<span>Tom Fitch’s “silver tongue” is very well</span>

					<span>For he must live by what he has to sell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And silver should be “free,” that’s very true.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You were not with them. I heard statesmen say</span>

				<p>
					<span class="i3">There was once a brave collision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">In Imaginary Bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">When a steamer with precision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Clove its comfortable way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through another, which had hospitably stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To receive it, as a civil steamer should.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Then the people on the latter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Said they didn’t understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">But they thought they’d better scatter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">To the most adjacent land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the people on the former said: “That’s so⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You will find it sixty fathoms down below.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Then the skipper of the vessel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Which was sinking in the brine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Said to t’other one: “I guess I’ll</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Trouble you to drop a line.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Well, just give me your address,” was the reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am busy but I’ll write you by-and-by.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Then the carpenter whose function</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Was to mend the leaky boat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Said: “So wide is our disjunction</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">That we cannot longer float.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See the rats already leave us!” And so he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up and hove his kit among them in the sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Though these incidents are cheerful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">For a landsman to relate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Yet the passengers were fearful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Of a melancholy fate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For their knowledge was imperfect of the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the fishes have of breathing in the bay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Some of them, who were accounted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Quite unmannerly and rude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">On the floating steamer mounted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Saying: “Hope we don’t intrude.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the others, with politeness rare and fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said their tickets were not good upon that line.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">But the skipper of the wetter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Ship, the pilot and the mate⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Nothing ever yet was better</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Than the way they met their fate;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the perils that beset them in their climb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They encountered with alacrity sublime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">When the troubles all were ended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">And the living safe in port</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Invitation was extended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">For them all to come to court.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the officers (they afterward explained)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were with deferential kindness entertained.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i3">Twenty Consuls, ten Inspectors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i4">Thirty Coroners were there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Eighty-seven skilled objectors</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And before that court the sailor-people sighed</span>

				<p>
					<span class="i3">The unanimous decision</span>

				<p>When a favourite dog has an incurable pain, you “put him out of his misery” with a bullet or an axe. A favourite child similarly afflicted is preserved as long as possible, in torment. I do not say that this is not right; I claim only that it is not consistent. There are two sorts of kindness; one for dogs, and another for children. A very dear friend, wallowing about in the red mud of a battle-field, once asked me for some of the dog sort. I suspect, if no one had been looking, he would have got it.</p>

				<p>It is to be feared that to most men the sky is but a concave mirror, showing nothing behind, and in looking into which they see only their own distorted images, like the reflection of a face in a spoon.

				<p>There is just as much true pleasure in walloping one’s own wife as in the sinful enjoyment of another man’s right.

				<h4 epub:type="title">Ye Idyll of Ye Hippopopotamus</h4>
				<p>
					<span>With a Methodist hymn in his musical throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Sun was emitting his ultimate note;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His quivering larynx enwrinkled the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like an Ichthyosaurian blowing his tea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When sweetly and pensively rattled and rang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This plaint which an Hippopopotamus sang:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O, Camomile, Calabash, Cartilage-pie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spread for my spirit a peppermint fry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crown me with doughnuts, and drape me with cheese,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Settle my soul with a codliver sneeze.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how I stand on my head and repine⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lollipop Lumpkin can never be mine!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Down sank the Sun with a kick and a plunge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up from the wave rose the head of a Sponge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ropes in his ringlets, eggs in his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tip-tilted nose in a way to surprise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These the conundrums he flung to the breeze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The answers that Echo returned to him these:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“Cobblestone, Cobblestone, why do you sigh⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Why do you turn on the tears?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My mother is crazy on strawberry jam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And my father has petrified ears.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“Liverwort, Liverwort, why do you droop⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Why do you snuffle and scowl?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My brother has cockle-burs into his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And my sister has married an owl.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“Simia, Simia, why do you laugh⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">Why do you cackle and quake?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My son has a pollywog stuck in his throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">And my daughter has bitten a snake.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Slow sank the head of the Sponge out of sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soaken with sea-water⁠—then it was night.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Moon had now risen for dinner to dress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When sweetly the Pachyderm sang from his nest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sang through a pestle of silvery shape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Encrusted with custard⁠—empurpled with crape;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was the burden he bore on his lips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And blew to the listening Sturgeon that sips</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the fountain of opium under the lobes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the mountain whose summit in buffalo robes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The winter envelops, as Venus adorns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An elephant’s trunk with a chaplet of thorns:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“Chasing mastodons through marshes upon stilts of light ratan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hunting spiders with a shotgun and mosquitoes with an axe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plucking peanuts ready roasted from the branches of the oak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Waking echoes in the forest with our hymns of blessed bosh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We roamed⁠—my love and I.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">By the margin of the fountain spouting thick with clabbered milk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under spreading boughs of bass-wood all alive with cooing toads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Loafing listlessly on boulders of octagonal design,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Standing gracefully inverted with our toes together knit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We loved⁠—my love and I.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hippopopotamus comforts his heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Biting half-moons out of strawberry tart.</span>

				<h4 epub:type="title">Communing with Nature</h4>
				<p>
					<span>One evening I sat on a heavenward hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The winds were asleep and all nature was still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wee children came round me to play at my knee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As my mind floated rudderless over the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I put out one hand to caress them, but held</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the other my nose, for these cherubim smelled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cast a few glances upon the old sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was red in the face from the race he had run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he seemed to be doing, for aught I could see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quite well without any assistance from me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so I directed my wandering eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around to the opposite side of the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the rapture that ever with ecstasy thrills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the heart as the moon rises bright from the hills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would in this case have been most exceedingly rare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Except for the fact that the moon was not there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the stars looked right lovingly down in the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, by Jupiter, Venus was winking at me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gas in the city was flaring up bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Montgomery Street was resplendent with light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I did not exactly appear to advance</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sentiment proper to that circumstance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it only remains to explain to the town</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a rainstorm came up before I could come down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the boots I had on were uncommonly thin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My fancy leaked out as the water leaked in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though dampened my ardour, though slackened my strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll “strike the wild lyre” who sings the sweet rain!</span>

				<p>
					<span>Old Zephyr, dawdling in the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looked down upon the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which slept unfretted at his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And balanced on its breast a fleet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That seemed almost to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suspended in the middle air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if a magnet held it there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternally at rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, one by one, the ships released</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their folded sails, and strove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the empty calm to press</span>
					<br/>
					<span>North, South, or West, or East,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain; the subtle nothingness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was impotent to move.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then Zephyr laughed aloud to see:⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No vessel moves except by me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, heigh⁠—ho! I shall sleep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lo! from out the troubled North</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tempest strode impatient forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And trampled white the deep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sloping ships flew glad away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laving their heated sides in spray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The West then turned him red with wrath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the North he shouted:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hold there! How dare you cross my path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As now you are about it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The North replied with laboured breath⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His speed no moment slowing:⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My friend, you’ll never have a path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless you take to blowing.”</span>

					<span>“Perfection of Creation’s plan,</span>

					<span>Thy final prayer shall now be heard:</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p>Of the verses republished in this volume and the next, some are censorious, and in these the names of real persons are used without their consent; so it seems fit that a few words be said of the matter in sober prose. Of my motive in writing and now republishing these personal satires I do not care to make either defense or explanation, except with reference to those, who, since my first censure of them, have passed away. To one having only a reader’s interest in the matter it may seem that the verses relating to those might properly have been omitted from this collection. But if these pieces, or, indeed, any considerable part of my work in literature, have the intrinsic interest, which, by this attempt to preserve some of it I have assumed, their permanent suppression is impossible; it is only a question of when and by whom they will be republished. Someone will surely search them out and put them into circulation.</p>
				<p>I conceive it to be the right of an author to have his fugitive work in newspapers and periodicals put into a more permanent form during his lifetime if he can; and this is especially true of one whose work, necessarily engendering animosities, is peculiarly exposed to challenge as unjust. That is a charge that can best be examined before time has effaced the evidence. For the death of a man whose unworth I have affirmed, I am in no way accountable, and however sincerely I may regret his passing, I can hardly be expected to consent that it shall affect my literary fortunes. If the satirist who does not accept the remarkable doctrine that while condemning a sin he should spare the sinner were bound to let the life of his work be coterminous with that of his subject his lot in letters were one of peculiar hardship.</p>
				<p>Persuaded of the validity of all this, I have not hesitated to reprint even certain “epitaphs,” which, once of the living, are now of the dead, as all the others must eventually be. The objection inheres in all forms of applied satire⁠—my understanding of whose laws, liberties and limitations, is at least derived from reverent study of the masters. That in respect of matters herein mentioned I have followed their practice can be shown by abundant instance and example.</p>
				<p>In arranging these verses for publication I have thought it needless to classify them as “serious,” “comic,” “sentimental,” “satirical,” and so forth. I do the reader the honor to think that he will readily discern the character of what he is reading, and I entertain the hope that his mood will accommodate itself without disappointment to that of his author.</p>

						<span>I know not if it was a dream. I viewed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A city where the restless multitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Between the eastern and the western deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had reared gigantic fabrics, strong and rude.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Colossal palaces crowned every height;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Towers from valleys climbed into the light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">O’er dwellings at their feet, great golden domes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung in the blue, barbarically bright.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But now, new-glimmering to-east, the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Touched the black masses with a grace of gray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Dim spires of temples to the nation’s God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Studding high spaces of the wide survey.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Well did the roofs their solemn secret keep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of life and death stayed by the truce of sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Yet whispered of an hour when sleepers wake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fool to hope afresh, the wise to weep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The gardens greened upon the builded hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the tethered thunders of the mills</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With sleeping wheels unstirred to service yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By the tamed torrents and the quickened rills.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A hewn acclivity, reprieved a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked on the builder’s blocks about his base</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And bared his wounded breast in sign to say:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Strike! ’tis my destiny to lodge your race.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“ ’Twas but a breath ago the mammoth browsed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon my slopes, and in my caves I housed</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Your shaggy fathers in their nakedness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While on their foeman’s offal they caroused.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Ships from afar afforested the bay.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within their huge and chambered bodies lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The wealth of continents; and merrily sailed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hardy argosies to far Cathay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Beside the city of the living spread⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strange fellowship!⁠—the city of the dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And much I wondered what its humble folk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see how bravely they were housed, had said.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Noting how firm their habitations stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Broad-based and free of perishable wood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">How deep in granite and how high in brass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The names were wrought of eminent and good,</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I said: “When gold or power is their aim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smile of beauty or the wage of shame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Men dwell in cities; to this place they fare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they would conquer an abiding fame.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>From the red East the sun⁠—a solemn rite⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crowned with a flame the cross upon a height</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Above the dead; and then with all his strength</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Struck the great city all aroar with light!</span>

						<span>I know not if it was a dream. I came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto a land where something seemed the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That I had known as ’twere but yesterday,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But what it was I could not rightly name.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It was a strange and melancholy land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Silent and desolate. On either hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Lay waters of a sea that seemed as dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dead above it seemed the hills to stand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Grayed all with age, those lonely hills⁠—ah me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How worn and weary they appeared to be!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Between their feet long dusty fissures clove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The plain in aimless windings to the sea.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One hill there was which, parted from the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood where the eastern water curved a-west.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Silent and passionless it stood. I thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw a scar upon its giant breast.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sun with sullen and portentous gleam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung like a menace on the sea’s extreme;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Nor the dead waters, nor the far, bleak bars</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cloud were conscious of his failing beam.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It was a dismal and a dreadful sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That desert in its cold, uncanny light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">No soul but I alone to mark the fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And imminence of everlasting night!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All presages and prophecies of doom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glimmered and babbled in the ghastly gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And in the midst of that accursed scene</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wolf sat howling on a broken tomb.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title" xml:lang="la">Elixir Vitae</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Of life’s elixir I had writ, when sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Pray Heaven it spared him who the writing read!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sealed upon my senses with so deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A stupefaction that men thought me dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The centuries stole by with noiseless tread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like spectres in the twilight of my dream;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw mankind in dim procession sweep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through life, oblivion at each extreme.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile my beard, like Barbarossa’s growing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loaded my lap and o’er my knees was flowing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The generations came with dance and song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each observed me curiously there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some asked: “Who was he?” Others in the throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied: “A wicked monk who slept at prayer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some said I was a saint, and some a bear⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These all were women. So the young and gay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Visibly wrinkling as they fared along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doddered at last on failing limbs away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though some, their footing in my beard entangled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell into its abysses and were strangled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last a generation came that walked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More slowly forward to the common tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then altogether stopped. The women talked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Excitedly; the men, with eyes agloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looked darkly on them with a look of doom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one cried out: “We are immortal now⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How need we these?” And a dread figure stalked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent, with gleaming axe and shrouded brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all men cried: “Decapitate the women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or soon there’ll be no room to stand or swim in!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So (in my dream) each lovely head was chopped</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From its fair shoulders, and but men alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were left in all the world. Birth being stopped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enough of room remained in every zone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Peace ascended Woman’s vacant throne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, life’s elixir being found (the quacks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their bread-and-butter in it gladly sopped)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas made worth having by the headsman’s axe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing which, I gave myself a hearty shaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crumbled all to powder in the waking.</span>

					<span>’Twas a Venerable Person, whom I met one Sunday morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All appareled as a prophet of a melancholy sect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in a Jeremaid of objurgatory warning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He lifted up his jodel to the following effect:</span>

					<span>“O ye sanguinary statesmen, intermit your verbal tussles!</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Lo! the time is close upon you when the madness of the season</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having howled itself to silence, like a Minnesota ’clone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will at last be superseded by the still, small voice of reason,</span>

					<span>And the politician’s paunch is round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he strokes it down and across as he sings:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’ve eaten my fill of the legs and wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The neck, the back, the pontifical nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Breast, belly and gizzard, for everything goes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The meat that’s dark (and there’s none that’s white)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exceeded the need of my appetite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I’ve bravely stuck to the needful work</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a hungry domestic hog would shirk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve eaten the fowl that the Fates commend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To reluctant lips of the People’s Friend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rank unspeakably, bitter as gall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is the bird, but I’ve eaten it, feathers and all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m a dutiful statesman, I am, although</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I really <em>don’t</em> like a diet of crow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I’ve dined all alone in a furtive way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But my platter I’ve cleaned every blessed day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They say that I bolt; so I do⁠—my bird;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They say that I sulk, but they’ve widely erred!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Lord! if my enemies only knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I’m full to the throat with the corvic stew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’d open their ears to hear me profess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The faith compelled by the corvic stress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For, alas! necessity knows no law)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the heavenly caucus⁠—‘Caw! Caw! Caw!’ ”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And that ornithanthropical person tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By flapping his arms on the air to ride;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I knew by the way that he clacked his bill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was just the poor, featherless biped, Dave Hill.</span>

				<p>
					<span>’Twas a sick young man with a face ungay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And an eye that was all alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he shook his head in a hopeless way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he sat on a roadside stone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O, ailing youth, what untoward fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has made the sun to set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On your mirth and eye?” “I’m constrained to state</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’m an ex-West Point cadet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ’Twas at cannon-practice I got my hurt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And my present frame of mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the gun went off with a double spurt⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before it, and also behind!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“How sad, how sad, that a fine young chap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When studying how to kill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should meet with so terrible a mishap</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Precluding eventual skill.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Ah, woeful to think that a weapon made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For mowing down the foe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should commit so dreadful an escapade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to turn about to mow!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No more he heeded while I condoled:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He was wandering in his mind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His lonely eye unconsidered rolled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his views he thus defined:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ’Twas O for a breach of the peace⁠—’twas O</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For an international brawl!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But a piece of the breech⁠—ah no, ah no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I didn’t want that at all.”</span>

					<span>You may say, if you please, Johnny Bull, that our girls</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are crazy to marry your dukes and your earls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I’ve heard that the maids of your own little isle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greet bachelor lords with a favoring smile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Nay, titles, ’tis said in defense of our fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are popular here because popular there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for them our ladies persistently go</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because ’tis exceedingly English, you know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whatever the motive, you’ll have to confess</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The effort’s attended with easy success;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And⁠—pardon the freedom⁠—’tis thought, over here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis mortification you mask with a sneer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It’s all very well, sir, your scorn to parade</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the high nasal twang of the Yankee maid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, ah, to my lord when he dares to propose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sound is so sweet as that “Yes” from the nose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, well, if the dukes and the earls and that lot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can stand it (God succor them if they can not!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your commoners ought to assent, I am sure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what they’re not called on to suffer, endure.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ’Tis nothing but money?⁠—Your nobles are bought?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to that, I submit, it is commonly thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That England’s a country not specially free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Croesi and (if you’ll allow it) Croesae.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You’ve many a widow and many a girl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With money to purchase a duke or an earl.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis a very remarkable thing, you’ll agree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When goods import buyers from over the sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alas for the woman of Albion’s isle!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She may simper; as well as she can she may smile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She may wear pantalettes and an air of repose⁠—</span>

					<span>The ironed anarchist no less.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thine altar-coals that touch the lips</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of prophets kindle, too, the brand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Discord flung with wanton hand</span>

				<p>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whose laws, imperfect and unjust,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Shall be so ruled in right and grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That men shall say: “O, drive afield</span>

					<span>No tongue infernal spake its name⁠—</span>

					<span class="i1">No tongue celestial.</span>

				<p>
					<span>So foul it was that even He</span>

					<span>The Thief Impenitent, his grim</span>

					<span>And savages their shining bodies warmed</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Armies went forth to battle on the plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far, far down in that unfathomed deep</span>

					<span class="i1">Nor even the widows could be heard to weep.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One might have thought their shaking was but laughter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, truly, most were married shortly after.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Above the wreckage of that silent fray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strange fishes swam in circles, round and round⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Black, double-finned; and once a little way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A bubble rose and burst without a sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a man tumbled out upon the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lord! ’twas an eerie thing to drift apace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that pellucid sea, beneath black skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And o’er the heads of an undrowning race;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when I woke I said⁠—to her surprise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who came with chocolate, for me to drink it:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“The atmosphere is deeper than you think it.”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Genius</h3>
				<p>
					<span>What is the thing called Genius? One has said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis general ability directed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into a special channel. One, instead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proffers a definition much respected</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By toiling dullards: genius, he explains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is infinite capacity for taking pains.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Max Nordau, seeing he has not the thing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has solemnly decided, with Lombroso,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That genius is degeneracy. Ring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The curtain down⁠—the show is only so-so;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d rather see a dog-fight than sit out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This inconclusive definition-bout.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What, then, is genius? Faith, I’m only sure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I am deep in doubt about the matter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But this I <em>think</em>: of two in literature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He is the greater genius who’s the fatter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas in an age less prosperous that those</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were kings of thought who starved by verse and prose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo! the lean rhapsodist whose soul surveys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ecstatic, his unprofitable vision,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interprets it in cleanly speech; arrays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His jeweled words with scholarly precision!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faith, he’s a dunce or he would never lack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The means to wedge his belly from his back.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twere passing easy to allay his pang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had he the genius⁠—that’s to say, the insight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commercial. If he would but sing in slang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He’d earn the wherewithal to make his skin tight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Genius (let’s now define the word afresh)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is the capacity to take on flesh.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Spirit of Letters, hail! Thy reign is Now;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy ministers are gentlemen that waddle⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Children of light and leading who avow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They swap, for tallow, speech that’s not a model⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For laminated kidney-suet trade</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unsavory words. You must be stout, George Ade.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Name nor fame had Picklepip:</span>

					<span>Ne’er a soldier nor a ship</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bore his banners in the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naught knew he of kingly sport,</span>

					<span>So it happened, as it ought,</span>

					<span>That his simple schemes he wrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the lagging summer’s day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a solitary way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it happened, as was best,</span>

					<span>This way eyed and that way tressed,</span>

					<span>Lying lead-like on a breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By cares of state enough oppressed.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Once to cask himself away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He prepared at close of day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he tugged with swelling throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At a most unkingly coat⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not to get it off, but on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the serving sun was gone⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passed a silk-appareled sprite</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward her castle on the height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seized and set the garment right.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned the startled Picklepip⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Splendid crimson cheek and lip!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned again to sneak away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she bade the villain stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bade him thank her, which he did</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a speech that slipped and slid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sprawled and stumbled in its gait</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a dancer tries to skate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the face of silk and lace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rags too bold should never be.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lady Minnow cocked her head:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mister Picklepip,” she said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Do you ever think to wed?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>

					<span>Wretched little Picklepip</span>

					<span>Nor to feed them any land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said he never in his life</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But the guilty stammer so</span>

					<span>That his meaning wouldn’t flow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he thought his aim to reach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By some figurative speech:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said his Fate had been unkind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had pursued him from behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(How the mischief could it else?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came upon him unaware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Caught him all too roughly⁠—there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gushed the little lady’s glee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a gush of golden bells:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Picklepip, why, that is me!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Town of Dae by the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grammar’s for great scholars⁠—she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loved the summer and the lea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Stupid little Picklepip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Allowed the subtle hint to slip⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Maundered on about the ship</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he did not chance to own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Told this grievance o’er and o’er,</span>

					<span>Lady Minnow, for reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cut him off with “So do I!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she reddened at the fib;</span>

					<span class="i1">Ne’er shall young and honest be.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Witless little Picklepip</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Manned again his mental ship</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And veered her with a sudden shift.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Painted to the lady’s thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How he wrestled and he wrought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stoutly with the swimming drift</span>

					<span class="i1">By the kindly river brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the mountain to the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fuel for the town of Dae.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tedious tale for lady’s ear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From her castle on the height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She had watched her water-knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the seasons of a year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Challenge more than met his view</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And conquer better than he knew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now she shook her pretty pate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stamped her foot⁠—’twas growing late:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mister Picklepip, when I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drifting seaward pass you by;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the waves my forehead kiss</span>

					<span>Sense of swooning and the beating</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a voice somewhere repeating</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something indistinctly heard!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the soul of Picklepip</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sprang upon his trembling lip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he spake no further word</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the wealth he did not own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that moment had outgrown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ship and mine and flock and land⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even his cask upon the strand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dropped a stricken star to earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Type of wealth and worldly worth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clomb the moon into the sky,</span>

					<span>Type of love’s immensity!</span>

					<span>Once I “dipt into the future far as human eye could see,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw⁠—it was not Sandow, nor John Sullivan, but she⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Emancipated Woman, who was weeping as she ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here and there for the discovery of Expurgated Man.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And that tardiest of mortals hadn’t evoluted yet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence the tears that she cascaded, hence the sighs that tore apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the tendinous connections of her indurated heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried Emancipated Woman, as she wearied of the search:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In Advancing I have left myself distinctly in the lurch!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeking still a worthy partner, from the land of brutes and dudes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have penetrated rashly into manless solitudes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now without a mate of any kind where am I?⁠—that’s to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where shall I be to-morrow?⁠—where exert my rightful sway</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the purifying strength of my emancipated mind?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can solitude be lifted up, vacuity refined?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Calling, calling from the shadows in the rear of my Advance⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the Region of Unprogress in the Dark Domain of Chance⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long I heard the Unevolvable beseeching my return</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To share the degradation he’s reluctant to unlearn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I’ve held my way regardless, evoluting year by year</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till I’m what you now behold me⁠—or would if you were here⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A condensed Emancipation and a Purifier proud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An Independent Entity appropriately loud!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Independent? Yes, in spirit, but (O, woeful, woeful state!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doomed to premature extinction by privation of a mate⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To extinction or reversion, for Unexpurgated Man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still awaits me in the backward if I sicken of the van.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O the horrible dilemma!⁠—to be odiously linked</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With an Undeveloped Species, or become a Type Extinct!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Emancipated Woman wailed her sorrow to the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stalking out of desolation came a being strange and rare⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plato’s Man!⁠—a biped, featherless from mandible to rump,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its wings two quilless flippers and its tail a plumeless stump.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First it scratched and then it clucked, as if in hospitable terms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It invited her to banquet on imaginary worms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it strutted up before her with a lifting of the head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in accents of affection and of sympathy it said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My estate is some’at ’umble, but I’m qualified to draw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near the hymeneal altar and whack up my heart and claw</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Which some do name a crematorium,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the vantage of whose greater maw’s</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Protested ’twere a sacrilege to burn</span>

					<span>God’s gracious images, designed to rot⁠—</span>

					<span>And bellowed for the right of way for each</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distempered carrion through the water pipes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With such a sturdy, boisterous exclaim</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They did discharge themselves from their own throats</span>

					<span>Against the splintered gates of audience</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twere wholesomer to take them in at mouth</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Blent indistinguishable in a mass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like winter-woven serpents in a pit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None vantaged with unfair precedency</span>

				<p>
					<span>The way was long, the hill was steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My footing scarcely I could keep.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The night enshrouded me in gloom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard the ocean’s distant boom⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The trampling of the surges vast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was borne upon the rising blast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“God help the mariner,” I cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whose ship to-morrow braves the tide!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then from the impenetrable dark</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A solemn voice made this remark:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For this locality⁠—warm, bright;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Barometer unchanged; breeze light.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Unseen consoler-man,” I cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whoe’er you are, where’er abide,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Thanks⁠—but my care is somewhat less</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Jack’s, than for my own, distress.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Could I but find a friendly roof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Small odds what weather were aloof.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For he whose comfort is secure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another’s pain can well endure.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“The latch-string’s out,” the voice replied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And so’s the door⁠—jes’ step inside.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then through the darkness I discerned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hovel, into which I turned.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Groping about beneath its thatch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I struck my head and then a match.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A candle by that gleam betrayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon lent paraffinaceous aid.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A pallid, bald and thin old man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw, who this complaint began:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Through summer suns and winter snows</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I sets observin’ of my toes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I rambles with increasin’ pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The path of duty, but in vain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Rewards and honors pass me by⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No Congress hears this raven cry!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Filled with astonishment, I spoke:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou ancient raven, why this croak?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“With observation of your toes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What Congress has to do, God knows!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“And swallow me if e’er I knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one could sit and ramble too!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To answer me that ancient swain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Took up his parable again:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Through winter snows and summer suns</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Weather Bureau here I runs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I calls the turn, and can declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jes’ when she’ll storm and when she’ll fair.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Three times a day I sings out clear</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Frivolity is seldom right.</span>

				<p>
					<span>“A scientist from times remote,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Not mine, O marvelous old man,</span>

					<span>The methods of your art to scan,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Yet here no instruments there be⁠—</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Did you (if questions you permit)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the asylum leave your kit?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That strange old man with motion rude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose to surprising altitude.</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>“My corns unleathered I expose</span>

				<p>
					<span>“No stockin’ from their ears keeps out</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sich delicacy some has got</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They know next summer’s to be hot.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This here one says (for that he’s best):</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Storm center passin’ to the west.’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“This feller’s vitals is transfixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With frost for Janawary sixt’.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“One chap jes’ now is occypied</span>

					<span>“By long a-studyin’ their throbs</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Much more, no doubt, he would have said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But suddenly he turned and fled;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For in mine eye’s indignant green</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay storms that he had not foreseen,</span>

					<span>The goblet’s edge; diced with his conscience; spread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like Sisyphus, a feast for Death, and spoke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His welcome in a tongue so long forgot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That even his ancient guest remembered not</span>

					<span>What race had cursed him in it. Thus my friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still conjugating with each failing sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The verb “to die” in every mood and tense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pursued his awful humor to the end.</span>

					<span>(So benign a Messalina!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said: “I’ll make a Naval Hero</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without fear⁠—O brave as Nero!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall dominate the ocean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By promotion, that’s my notion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my other sons of thunder</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then shall plunder vainly under</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Incomparable Person,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interspersin’ lively cursin’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With their futile strife to shiver</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every river-pirate’s liver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to ascertain the measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his treasure at their leisure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I’ll so arrange the looting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the shooting and the hooting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the making frightful faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(These grimaces are the bases</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of our tactics) that they never,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Howsoever brave and clever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall have any kind of inning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the skinning now beginning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I’ll see that in the story</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the gory game of glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The historian shall slight ’em</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or indict ’em⁠—maybe bite ’em.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the Hero of my making,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom I’m aching to be waking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into visible existence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall distance these Philistines.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fame’s loud trumpet⁠—he shall hear it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blown with spirit in his ear, it</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall extol his birth and breeding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His exceeding knack at leading</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In a sanguinary sea fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or a tea fight, or a flea fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till he burst with admiration</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his station in the nation!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then while all the people mock him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll unfrock him! That will shock him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus the Queen of Nether China,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Regina Mun-Kee-Shina,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made to Naval Evolution</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Confucian contribution.</span>

					<span>In Ballybazoo the young men woo</span>

				<p>

					<br/>
					<span>This sternly dissenting maiden (who,</span>

					<span>With a cheek of steel and a brow of brass.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Then all the young men of Ballybazoo</span>

					<span>(With the irresistible hob-nail shoe)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beautiful maiden from Ghargharoo.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As each fond lover with ardor threw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His heel in her upturned face there flew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A rain of sparks that consumed his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Affecting his mind with a great surprise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When all the young men had renounced their sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The metal-faced maiden she sat upright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remarking: “There’s nothing here to do⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dull, dull village is Ballybazoo.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From Ballybazoo to Ghargharoo</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cheek-whole maiden her armament drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her playmate lovers raised a hurroo</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That saddened the sightless in Ballybazoo.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A stranger there was who cherished a heel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of double-case-hardened, cold-rolled chrome steel!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And taking thought he decided to woo.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As ’twas his undoubted right to do.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To display his charms he removed his shoe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And boarding her visage, began to woo.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there in the gloaming, and not in vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old, old story was told again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was long ago in the sainted past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But traits long latent crop out at last;</span>

					<span>I dreamed, and in my dream came one who said:</span>

					<span>“Because thou art all sullen; and because</span>

					<br/>
					<span>(Or sayst thou didst) pour from thy riven vein</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In testimony to thy patriot zeal;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Or why it knoweth not; because all this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And much beside is true, I come⁠—”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Forbear,” I cried, “to name thine errand⁠—all</span>

					<span>Too well I know it for the sword, the scales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shrouded eyes (albeit methinks I catch</span>

					<span>A twinkle now and then beneath the band)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speak to my conscience of a traitor’s doom!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strike, then, but hear. To westward, roaring up</span>

					<span>The means of life of those who kindle them;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of Anglo-Saxon institutions, or</span>

				<p>
					<span>Captain Purvis, for aught <em>we</em> know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never slew a Filipino;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Played exceeding well at polo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But invited not the bolo.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though his form was big and burly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his fist was hard and knurly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his cocktail hour came early,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet he was devoid of thirst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the blood of the accurst.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inconsiderate Tagallo</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Seas of gore, however shallow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He regarded very lightly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As inutile and unsightly);</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he did not much frequent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That insurrectionary gent.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Captain Purvis went a-scouting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Truth to tell, he took an outing)⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Found a Filipino sleeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bound and took him into keeping.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Calling Sergeant-Major Gump,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They conveyed him to a pump,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laid him on his back beneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his tongue between his teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the captain: “We’ll not thump him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he is a spy⁠—we’ll pump him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s our duty; information,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Secrets useful to the nation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll wring from him. Tell me, sir,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me truly, why a cur</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wags its tail⁠—and, furthermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When a door Is not a door.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But that person obstinacious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answered, with a look ungracious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he’d see them (he was witty)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both in Helfurst⁠—that’s a city</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Silesia, I suppose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where no proper person goes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they pumped him full of water⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Son of Temperance, or Daughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er was half so full as that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor any poison-fevered rat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trying with a fervor frantic</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To abolish the Atlantic.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yes, that Filipino bloated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till his snowry liver floated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a lily on a pond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his soul to the Beyond</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drifted on the strong, full tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“By word of mouth,” from his inside.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Captain Purvis being duly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tried, the President said: “Truly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’s a water-warrior; he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would more fitly serve at sea.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the Navy broke his fall⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rearest-Admiral of all!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By his ironclad desk he’s sitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes writing, sometimes knitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For he’s Chief (and that’s enough)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the Bureau of Plum Duff.</span>

					<span>Would go philandering with another girl</span>
					<br/>

				<p>
					<span>See how she served McKinley! All his life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wooed her for his morganatic wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swore that he loved her better than his soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I’m half inclined to think, upon the whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She better did deserve his love) then vowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’d marry her alive, or even aloud!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What did she? Ere his breath he could recover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She heartlessly accepted that poor lover!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There’s William Bryan of the silver tongue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old in ambition, in discretion young⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He courts her with the song, the dance, the lute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But knows how suitors feel who do not suit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Teddy Roosevelt, plucking from its sheath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The weapon that he wears behind his teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Endeavors in his simple, soldier fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all in vain, to touch her heart by slashin’.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Beware, my web-foot friend, beware her wiles:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fly from her sighs and disregard her smiles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She’s no fool mermaid with a comb and glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Satan’s daughter with a breast of brass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put out your prow to sea again⁠—but hold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If Bryan and McKinley, all too bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Show up along the beach with little Teddy⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Each window noted, tried each door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scanned carefully the lidded hole</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For minstrels to cascade the coal⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In short, examined five-and-twenty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shortcuts from poverty to plenty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all were sealed, they saw full soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against the minions of the moon.</span>

				<p>
					<span>When I was young and full of faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And other fads that youngsters cherish</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A cry rose as of one that saith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With emphasis: “Help or I perish!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas heard in all the land, and men</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sound were each to each repeating.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It made my heart beat faster then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than any heart can now be beating.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For the world is old and the world is gray⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span>She’s cut her wisdom teeth, they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And doesn’t now go in for Pity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besides, the melancholy cry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was that of one, ’tis now conceded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose plight no one beneath the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Felt half so poignantly as he did.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Moreover, he was black. And yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sentimental generation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With an austere compassion set</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its face and faith to the occasion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then there were hate and strife to spare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And various hard knocks a-plenty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I (’twas more than my true share,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That all is over now⁠—the reign</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And the clear heavens arch again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above a land of peace and pensions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The black chap⁠—at the last we gave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him everything that he had cried for,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though many white chaps in the grave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twould puzzle to say what they died for.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">An Alibi</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A famous journalist, who long</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had told the great unheaded throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whate’er they thought, by day or night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was true as Holy Writ, and right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was caught in⁠—well, on second thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is enough that he was caught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, thrown into a jail, became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fuel of a public flame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Vox populi vox Dei</i>,” said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The jailer. Inxling bent his head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without remark: that motto good</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In bold-faced type had always stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above the columns where his pen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had rioted in praise of men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all they said⁠—provided he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was sure they mostly did agree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile a sharp and bitter strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take, or save, the culprit’s life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or liberty (which, I suppose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was much the same to him) arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside. The journal that his pen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Adorned denounced his crime⁠—but then</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its editor in secret tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the indictment set aside.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The opposition papers swore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His father was a rogue before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his wife’s relations were</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like him and similar to her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They begged their readers to subscribe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dollar each to make a bribe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That any Judge would feel was large</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enough to prove the gravest charge⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless, it might be, the Defense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put up superior evidence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The law’s traditional delay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was all too short: the trial day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dawned red and menacing. The Judge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat on the Bench and wouldn’t budge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the motions counsel made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could not move <em>him</em>⁠—and there he stayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The case must now proceed,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“While I am just, in heart and head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It happens⁠—as, indeed, it ought⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both sides with equal sums have bought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My favor: I can try the cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Impartially.” (Prolonged applause.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The prisoner was now arraigned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said that he was greatly pained</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be suspected⁠—<em>he</em>, whose pen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had charged so many other men</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crimes and misdemeanors! “Why,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, a tear in either eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If men who live by crying out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Stop thief!’ are not themselves from doubt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their integrity exempt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let all forego the vain attempt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make a reputation! Sir,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m innocent, and I demur.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat a thousand voices cried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he indubitably lied⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vox populi as loudly roared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As bull by <i xml:lang="es">picadores</i> gored,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his own coin receiving pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To make a Spanish holiday.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The jury⁠—twelve good men and true⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were then sworn in to see it through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each made solemn oath that he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As any babe unborn was free</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From prejudice, opinion, thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Respectability, brains⁠—aught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That could disqualify; and some</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Explained that they were deaf and dumb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A better twelve, his Honor said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was rare, except among the dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The witnesses were called and sworn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tales they told made angels mourn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Good Book they’d kissed became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Red with the consciousness of shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whenever one of them approached</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The truth, “That witness wasn’t coached,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your Honor!” cried the lawyers both.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Strike out his testimony,” quoth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The learned Judge: “this court denies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its ear to stories that surprise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hold that witnesses exempt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From coaching all are in contempt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both Prosecution and Defense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Applauded the judicial sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the spectators all averred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such wisdom they had never heard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas plain the prisoner would be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Found guilty in the first degree.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile that wight’s pale cheek confessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nameless terrors in his breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He felt remorseful, too, because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wasn’t half they said he was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I’d been such a rogue,” he mused</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On opportunities unused,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I might have easily become</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As wealthy as Methusalum.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This journalist adorned, alas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The middle, not the Bible, class.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With equal skill the lawyers’ pleas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attested their divided fees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each gave the other one the lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then helped him frame a sharp reply.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Good Lord! it was a bitter fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lasted all the day and night.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When once or oftener the roar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had silenced the judicial snore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The speaker suffered for the sport</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By fining for contempt of court.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twelve jurors’ noses good and true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unceasing sang the trial through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even vox populi was spent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rattles through a nasal vent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clerk, bailiff, constables and all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard Morpheus sound the trumpet call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To arms⁠—his arms⁠—and all fell in</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save counsel for the Man of Sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thaumaturgist stood and swayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wand their faculties obeyed⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That magic wand which, like a flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leapt, wavered, quivered and became</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A wonder-worker⁠—known among</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ignoble vulgar as a Tongue.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How long, O Lord, how long my verse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Runs on for better or for worse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In meter which o’ermasters me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Octosyllabically free!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A meter which, the poets say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No power of restraint can stay;⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A hard-mouthed meter, suited well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him who, having naught to tell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Must hold attention as a trout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is held, by paying out and out</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The people’s voice from heaven had caught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God’s inspiration took a change</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of venue⁠—it was passing strange!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight to his editor he went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that ingenious person sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Negro to impersonate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fugitive. In adequate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Disguise he took his vacant place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And buried in his arms his face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When all was done the lawyer stopped</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And silence like a bombshell dropped</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the court: Judge, jury, all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within that venerable hall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Except the deaf and dumb, indeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one or two whom death had freed)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awoke and tried to look as though</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slumber was all they did not know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now that tireless lawyer-man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Took breath, and then again began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Your Honor, if you did attend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To what I’ve urged (my learned friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nodded concurrence) to support</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The motion I have made, this court</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May soon adjourn. With your assent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve shown abundant precedent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For introducing now, though late,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New evidence to exculpate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My client. So, if you’ll allow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll prove an alibi!” “What?⁠—how?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stammered the judge. “Well, yes, I can’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deny your showing, and I grant</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The motion. Do I understand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You undertake to prove⁠—good land!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That when the crime⁠—you mean to show</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your client wasn’t <em>there</em>?” “O, no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot quite do that, I find:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My alibi’s another kind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of alibi⁠—I’ll make it clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your Honor, that he isn’t <em>here</em>.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Darky here upreared his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tranquillity affrighted fled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And consternation reigned instead!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Pray how do you manage these cumbersome wings?</span>

					<span>This halo⁠—I dare say I’m terribly green,</span>

					<span>But somehow I can’t make it hold my dudheen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This harp is all right, but the shamrock I miss,</span>

					<span>The Morey epistle, which lost you the vote</span>
					<br/>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then Garfield, his eyes on the cloud at his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Burned in the cheeks with a fervor divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That conquered his halo’s inferior shine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said, with a look that was level and far:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I fear (to be honest and frank) that you are.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The person who wrote that mysterious, queer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bad letter is here⁠—ah, exceedingly here.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he smiled in an infantile sort of a way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a man with a qualm, and went on to say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’m happy to meet you. What news from below?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did it look when you left there as if they would show</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who wrote, with a villainous purpose in view,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The peppery letters imputed to you?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Said <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Parnell: “Yes, it did, I must say⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fact, that’s the reason I hastened away.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they sang a psalm, and they sang so well</span>

					<span>That Murchison heard it while sobbing in Hell.</span>

					<span>Stood by to marvel at him when</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His slow advance along the street</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was but a vain cycloidal feat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And when ’twas fated that he fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a wide geographic sprawl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They signified assent by sounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard (faintly) at its utmost bounds.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And yet this <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Shanahan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast not on wine his thirsty eyes</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All malt, or spirituous tope</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He loathed as cats dissent from soap;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cider, if it touched his lip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Evoked a groan at every sip.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But still, as heretofore explained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He not infrequently was grained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I’m not of those who call it “corned”⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Coarse speech I’ve always duly scorned.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Though truth to say, and that’s but right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strong drink (it hath an adder’s bite!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was what had put him in the mud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The only kind he used was blood!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alas, that an immortal soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Addicted to the flowing bowl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The emptied flagon should again</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replenish from a neighbor’s vein!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Shanahan was so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Constructed, and his taste that low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not more deplorable was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In kind of thirst than in degree;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For sometimes fifty souls would pay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The debt of nature in a day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To free him from the shame and pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dread Sobriety’s misreign.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His native land, proud of its sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his unique inabstinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abated something of its pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At thought of his unfilled inside;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And some the boldness had to say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twere well if he were called away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To slake his thirst forevermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In oceans of celestial gore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But Hans Pietro Shanahan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knew that his thirst was mortal; so</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remained unsainted here below⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unsainted and unsaintly, for</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He neither went to glory nor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To abdicate his power deigned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where, under Providence, he reigned,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But kept his Boss’s power accurst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To serve his wild uncommon thirst.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which now had grown so truly great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was a drain upon the State.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Soon, soon there came a time, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he turned down an empty glass⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All practicable means were vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His special wassail to obtain.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In vain poor Decimation tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To furnish forth the needful tide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Civil War as vainly shed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its niggard offering of red.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Poor Shanahan! his thirst increased</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until he wished himself deceased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invoked the firearm and the knife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But could not die to save his life!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He was so dry his own veins made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No answer to the seeking blade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So weak that when he would have passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Away he could not breathe his last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas then, when almost in despair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Unlaced his shoon, unkempt his hair)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw as in a dream a way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wet afresh his mortal clay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, Hans Pietro Shanahan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Who was a most ingenious man)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw freedom, and with joy and pride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thalassa! (or Thalatta!)” cried.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Straight to the aldermen went he,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And the wonderful altitude of some</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was exceptionally splendid.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>While executing a shake of the head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the hand, as it were, of a master,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This agonizing old gentleman said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“ ’Twas a truly sad disaster!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Four hundred and ten longs and shorts in all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went down”⁠—he paused and snuffled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A single tear was observed to fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the old man’s drum was muffled.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“A very calamitous year,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And again his head-piece hoary</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shook, and another pearl he shed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if he wept con amore.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O lachrymose person,” I cried, “pray why</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should these failures so affect you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With speculators in stocks no eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That’s normal would ever connect you.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He focused his orbs upon mine and smiled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In a sinister sort of manner.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Young man,” he said, “your words are wild:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I spoke of the steamship <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hanner</i>.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“For she has went down in a howlin’ squall,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Four hundred and ten longs and shorts in all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will never need undertakin’!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“I’m in the business myself,” said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And you’ve mistook my expression;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I uses the technical terms, you see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Employed in my perfession.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That old undertaker has joined the throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the other side of the River,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I’m still unhappy to think I’m a “long,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a tape-line makes me shiver.</span>

					<span>Time was, not very long ago,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by historians time is reckoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When first of virtues here below</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was hatred of secession, though</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some swore it wasn’t even second;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But these (they mostly were down South)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have all renounced their view with candor⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some tardily by word of mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some, earlier, in a manner grander.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To stamp their error out, ’tis true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We paid enough of blood (the treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would pave with gold an avenue)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To float a battleship or two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If so the cost we choose to measure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas worth it all, we say and say⁠—</span>

					<span class="i1">The President has often said it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so it was⁠—to <em>us</em>; and they</span>

				<p>
					<span>“Times change and we change with them,” men</span>

					<span class="i1">Of old renown averred in Latin;</span>

					<span>And that’s as true on tongue or pen</span>

					<span>For see how many play their parts</span>

				<p>
					<span>O men of variable views,</span>

					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Nay, is it that you scent a gain</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Tale of a Crime</h3>

					<span>Once, in the olden time, a certain King</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(But where he reigned I know not) said: “Go bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Chief Adviser here before the throne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cut his head off clear down to the bone!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“With pleasure, Sire,” said⁠—keen to earn his wage⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The High Dissuader from the Sin of Age;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“But kings should still be civil, even when just:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll charge the villain with some crime, I trust?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Why, that’s no more than fair,” the King replied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They brought the culprit in, securely tied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the King said: “Let someone who can read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stand forward and unfold the Golden Screed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bright with the names of all the sins and crimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vices ever known from ancient times.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll fit the fellow for the headsman’s prank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With one appropriate to his face and rank.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In drowsy monotone the Lector read</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shining list, beginning at the head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Lèse-majesté was naturally first⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of crimes conceivable, the blackest, worst!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As each was named the prisoner addressed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The throne and, as the law compelled, confessed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas fatal not to: in that olden day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little was heard about the law’s delay.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But still the royal taste could find for him</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No crime well suited to the royal whim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, wearied by the reader’s droning voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sovereign fell asleep, nor made a choice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Snored like an organ till the stones were jarred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distinguishing the palace from the yard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meantime, the accused continued to confess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each nod said “guilty” and each look said “yes.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And still the monarch slept: each courtier feared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To wake him lest himself should “lose his beard.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(’Twas a fine euphemism, and meant his head⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some things for prudence are obliquely said.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Finis” the reader said, and roundabout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell silence like a loud awakening shout!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The startled sovereign left a snore half-snored⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That’s what the scoundrel’s guilty of!” he roared.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So there before the king upon his throne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cut his head off clean down to the bone!</span>
					<br/>

				<p>
					<span>Christmas, you tell me, comes but once a year.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One place it never comes, and that is here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, in these pages no good wishes spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No well-worn greetings tediously ring⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Christmas greetings are like pots of ore:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hollower they are they ring the more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here shall no holly cast a spiny shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor mistletoe my solitude invade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No trinket-laden vegetable come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No jorum steam with Sheolate of rum.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No shrilling children shall their voices rear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hurrah for Christmas without Christmas cheer!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No presents, if you please⁠—I know too well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What Herbert Spencer, if he didn’t tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I know not if he did) yet might have told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of present-giving in the days of old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Early Man with gifts propitiated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chiefs whom most he doubted, feared and hated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or tendered them in hope to reap some rude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Advantage from the taker’s gratitude.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since thus the Gift its origin derives</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(How much of its first character survives</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You know as well as I) my stocking’s tied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My pocket buttoned⁠—with my soul inside.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I save my money and I save my pride.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dinner? Yes; thank you⁠—just a baby’s body</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Done to a nutty brown, and a tear toddy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give me appetite; and as to drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About a half a jug of blood, I think,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will do; for still I love the good red wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Coagulating well, with wrinkles fine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fretting the satin surface of its flood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O tope of kings⁠—divine Falernian⁠—blood!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Duse take the shouting fowls upon the limb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The kneeling cattle and the rising hymn!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Has not a pagan rights to be regarded⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His heart assaulted and his ear bombarded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sentiments and sounds that good old Pan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even in his demonium would ban?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No, friends⁠—no Christmas here, for I have sworn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To keep my heart hard and my knees unworn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enough you have of jester, player, priest:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I as the skeleton attend your feast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the mad revelry to make a lull</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With shaken finger and with bobbing skull.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>However you my services may flout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Philosophy disdain and reason doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean to hold in customary state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My dismal revelry and celebrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My yearly rite until the crack o’ doom⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ignore the cheerful season’s warmth and bloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cultivate an oasis of gloom.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Free Trader’s Lament</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Oft from a trading-boat I purchased spice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shells and corals, brought for my inspection</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the fair tropics⁠—paid a Christian price</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was content in my fool’s paradise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where never had been heard the word “Protection.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas my sole island; there I dwelt alone⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No customs-house, collector nor collection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But a man came who in a pious tone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Condoled with me that I had never known</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The manifest advantage of Protection.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, when the trading-boat arrived one day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He threw a stink-pot into its mid-section.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The traders paddled for their lives away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor came again into that haunted bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The blessed home thereafter of Protection.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then down he sat, that philanthropic man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spat upon some mud of his selection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And worked it, with his knuckles in a pan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To shapes of shells and coral things, and span</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A thread of song in glory of Protection.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He baked them in the sun. His air devout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enchanted me. I made a genuflection:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“God help you, gentle sir,” I said. “No doubt,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered gravely, “I’ll get on without</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assistance now that we have got Protection.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thenceforth I bought his wares⁠—at what a price</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For shells and corals of such imperfection!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, now,” said he, “your lot is truly nice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still in all that isle there was no spice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To season to my taste that dish, Protection.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Subterranean Phantasies</h3>
				<p>
					<span>I died. As meekly in the earth I lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With shriveled fingers reverently folded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The worm⁠—uncivil engineer!⁠—my clay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tunneled industriously, and the mole did.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My body could not dodge them, but my soul did;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For that had flown from this terrestrial ball</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I was rid of it for good and all.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So there I lay, debating what to do⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What measures might most usefully be taken</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To circumvent the subterranean crew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of anthropophagi and save my bacon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My fortitude was all this while unshaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But any gentleman, of course, protests</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Against receiving uninvited guests.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>However proud he might be of his meats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not even Apicius, nor, I think, Lucullus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wasted on tramps his culinary sweets;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Aut Caesar</i>,” say judicious hosts, “<i xml:lang="la">aut nullus</i>.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And though when Marcius came unbidden Tullus</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aufidius feasted him because he starved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marcius by Tullus afterward was carved.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We feed the hungry, as the book commands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(For men might question else our orthodoxy)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But do not care to see the outstretched hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so we minister to them by proxy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Want, in his improper person, knocks he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Finds we’re engaged. The graveworm’s very fresh</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To think we like his presence in the flesh.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>So, as I said, I lay in doubt; in all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That underworld no judges could determine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My rights. When Death approaches them they fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And falling, naturally soil their ermine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And still below ground, as above, the vermin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That work by dark and silent methods win</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The case⁠—the burial case that one is in.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cases at law so slowly get ahead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even when the right is visibly unclouded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That if all men are classed as quick and dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The judges all are dead, though some unshrouded.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pray Jove that when they’re actually crowded</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Styx’s brink, and Charon rows in sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His bark prove worse than Cerberus’s bite.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah! Cerberus, if you had but begot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A race of three-mouthed dogs for man to nourish</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And woman to caress, the muse had not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lamented the decay of virtues currish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And triple-hydrophobia now would flourish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For barking, biting, kissing to employ</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Canine repeaters were indeed a joy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lord! how we cling to this vile world! Here I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose dust was laid ere I began this carping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By moles and worms and such familiar fry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Run through and through, am singing still and harping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of mundane matters⁠—flatting, too, and sharping.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hate the Angel of the Sleeping-Cup:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I’m for getting⁠—and for shutting⁠—up.</span>

					<span>Beauty (they called her) wasn’t a maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of many things in the world afraid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wasn’t a maid who turned and fled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sight of a mouse, alive or dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wasn’t a maid a man could “shoo”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By shouting, however abruptly, “Boo!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wasn’t a maid who’d run and hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If her face and figure you idly eyed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wasn’t a maid who’d blush and shake</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When asked what part of the fowl she’d take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I blush myself to confess she preferred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And commonly got, the most of the bird.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She wasn’t a maid to simper because</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She was asked to sing⁠—if she ever was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In short, if the truth must be displayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All naked⁠—Beauty wasn’t a maid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beauty, furry and fine and fat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yawny and clawy, sleek and all that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was a pampered and spoiled Angora cat!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I loved her well, and I’m proud that she</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wasn’t indifferent, quite, to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fact I have sometimes gone so far</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(You know, mesdames, how silly men are)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to think she preferred⁠—excuse the conceit⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span><em>My</em> legs upon which to sharpen her feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps it shouldn’t have gone for much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I started and thrilled beneath her touch!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah, well, that’s ancient history now:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fingers of Time have touched my brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I hear with never a start to-day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Beauty has passed from the earth away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gone!⁠—her death-song (it killed her) sung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gone!⁠—her fiddlestrings all unstrung.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gone to the bliss of a new regime</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of turkey smothered in seas of cream;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of roasted mice (a superior breed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To science unknown and the coarser need</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the living cat) cooked by the flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the dainty soul of an erring dame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who gave to purity all her care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neglecting the duty of daily prayer⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crisp, delicate mice, just touched with spice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the ghost of a breeze from Paradise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A very digestible sort of mice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let scoffers sneer, I propose to hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That Beauty has mounted the Stair of Gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To eat and eat, forever and aye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On a velvet rug from a golden tray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the human spirit⁠—that is my creed⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rots in the ground like a barren seed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is my creed, abhorred by Man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But approved by Cat since time began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till Death shall kick at me, thundering “Scat!”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Cynic’s Bequest</h3>
				<p>
					<span>In that fair city, Ispahan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwelt a problematic man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose angel never was released,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who never once let out his beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But kept, through all the seasons’ round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silence unbroken and profound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No Prophecy, with ear applied</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To key-hole of the future, tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Successfully to catch a hint</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what he’d do nor when begin’t;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sternly did his past defy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mild Retrospection’s backward eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though all admired his silent ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The women loudest were in praise:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ladies love those men the most</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who never, never, never boast⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who ne’er disclose their aims and ends</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To naughty, naughty, naughty friends.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet, sooth to say, the fame outran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The merit of this doubtful man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For taciturnity in him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though not a mere caprice or whim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not a virtue, such as truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>High birth, or beauty, wealth or youth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas known, indeed, throughout the span</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Ispahan, of Gulistan⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These utmost limits of the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knew that the man was dumb from birth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Unto the Sun with deep salaams</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Parsee spreads his morning palms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(A beacon blazing on a height</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Warms o’er his piety by night.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Moslem deprecates the deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cuts off the head that holds the creed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then reverently goes to grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Muttering thanks to Balaam’s Ass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For faith and learning to refute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Idolatry so dissolute!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But should a maniac dash past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With straws in beard and hands upcast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him (through whom, whene’er inclined</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To preach a bit to Madmankind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Holy Prophet speaks his mind)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our True Believer lifts his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devoutly and his prayer applies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But next to Solyman the Great</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reveres the idiot’s sacred state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Small wonder then, our worthy mute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was held in popular repute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had he been blind as well as mum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Been lame as well as blind and dumb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No bard that ever sang or soared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could say how he had been adored.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More meagerly endowed, he drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An homage less prodigious. True,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No soul his praises but did utter⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All plied him with devotion’s butter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But none had out⁠—’twas to their credit⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The proselyting sword to spread it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I state these truths, exactly why</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The reader knows as well as I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’ve nothing in the world to do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With what I hope we’re coming to</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If Pegasus be good enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To move when he has stood enough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Egad! his ribs I would examine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had I a sharper spur than famine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or even with that if ’twould incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To examine his instead of mine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where was I? Ah, that silent man</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who dwelt one time in Ispahan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had a name⁠—was known to all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Meerza Solyman Zingall.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There lived afar in Astrabad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man the world agreed was mad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wickedly he broke his joke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the heads of duller folk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So miserly, from day to day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He gathered up and hid away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vaults obscure and cellars haunted</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What many worthy people wanted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A stingy man!⁠—the tradesmen’s palms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were spread in vain: “I give no alms</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without inquiry”⁠—so he’d say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And beat the needy duns away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bastinado did, ’tis true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Persuade him, now and then, a few</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Odd tens of thousands to disburse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To glut the taxman’s hungry purse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still, so rich he grew, his fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was constant that the Shah might hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The Shah had heard it long ago,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And asked the taxman if ’twere so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who promptly answered, rather airish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The man had long been on the parish.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more he feared, the more he grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A cynic and a miser, too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until his bitterness and pelf</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made him a terror to himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, with a razor’s neckwise stroke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He tartly cut his final joke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So perished, not an hour too soon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wicked Muley Ben Maroon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From Astrabad to Ispahan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At camel speed the rumor ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, breaking through tradition hoar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And throwing all his kinsmen o’er,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The miser’d left his mighty store</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of gold⁠—his palaces and lands⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To needy and deserving hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Except a penny here and there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To pay the dervishes for prayer.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas known indeed throughout the span</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of earth, and into Hindustan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That our beloved mute was the</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Residuary legatee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people said ’twas very well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And each man had a tale to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of how he’d had a finger in’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By dropping many a friendly hint</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At Astrabad, you see. But ah,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They feared the news might reach the Shah!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To prove the will the lawyers bore’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before the Kadi’s awful court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who nodded, when he heard it read,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Confirmingly, his drowsy head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor thought, his sleepiness so great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Himself to gobble the estate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I give,” the dead had writ, “my all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Meerza Solyman Zingall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Ispahan. With this estate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I might quite easily create</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ten thousand ingrates, but I shun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Temptation and create but one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In whom the whole unthankful crew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rich man’s air that ever drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fat their pauper lungs I fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With vain vicarious desire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From foul Ingratitude’s base rout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pick this hapless devil out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bestowing on him all my lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My treasures, camels, slaves and bands</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wives⁠—I give him all this loot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And throw my blessing in to boot.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold, all men, in this bequest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Philanthropy’s long wrongs redressed:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak me ill that man I dower</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With fiercest will who lacks the power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Allah il Allah! now let him bloat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With rancor till his heart’s afloat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unable to discharge the wave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his benefactor’s grave!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Forth in their wrath the people came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And swore it was a sin and shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To trick their blessed mute; and each</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Protested, serious of speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That though he’d long foreseen the worst</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He’d been against it from the first.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By many means they vainly tried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The testament to set aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each ready with his empty purse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take upon himself the curse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For <em>they</em> had powers of invective</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enough to make it ineffective.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ingrates mustered, every man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And marched in force to Ispahan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Which had not quite accommodation)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And held a camp of indignation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The man, this while, who never spoke⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On whom had fallen this thunder-stroke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of fortune, gave no feeling vent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor dropped a hint of his intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereas no power to him came</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His benefactor to defame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some (such a length had slander gone to)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even whispered that he didn’t want to!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But none his secret could divine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If suffering he made no sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until one night as winter neared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all his haunts he disappeared⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Evanished in a doubtful blank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like little crayfish in a bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their heads retracting when you find ’em,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pulling in their holes behind ’em.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All through the land of Gul, the stout</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Young Spring is kicking Winter out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grass sneaks in upon the scene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Defacing it with bottle-green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stumbling lamb arrives to ply</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His restless tail in every eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eats nasty mint to spoil his meat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make himself unfit to eat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Madly his throat the bulbul tears⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every grove blasphemes and swears</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the immodest rose displays</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her shameless charms a dozen ways.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! now, throughout the utmost span</span>

					<span>Of Ispahan⁠—of Gulistan⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A big new book’s displayed in all</span>

					<span>The shops and cumbers every stall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The price is low⁠—the dealers say ’tis⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the rich are treated to it gratis.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Engraven on its foremost page</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These title-words the eye engage:</span>

					<span>“The Life of Muley Ben Maroon,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Of a person known as Peters I will humbly crave your leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An unusual adventure into narrative to weave⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William Perry Peters, of the town of Muscatel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A public educator and an orator as well.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters had a weakness which, ’tis painful to relate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was a strong predisposition to the pleasures of debate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would foster disputation wheresoever he might be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In polygonal contention none so happy was as he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas observable, however, that the exercises ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into monologue by Peters, that rhetorical young man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Muscatelian rustics who assisted at the show,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By involuntary silence testified their overthrow⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters, all unheedful of their silence and their grief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still effacing every vestige of erroneous belief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, he was a sore affliction to all heretics so bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to entertain opinions that he didn’t care to hold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One day⁠—’twas in pursuance of a pedagogic plan</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the mental elevation of Uncultivated Man⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Peters, to his pupils, in dismissing them, explained</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the Friday evening following (unless, indeed, it rained)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would be signalized by holding in the schoolhouse a debate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free to all who their opinions might desire to ventilate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the question, “Which is better, as a serviceable gift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speech or hearing, from barbarity the human mind to lift?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pupils told their fathers, who, forehanded always, met</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the barroom to discuss it every evening, dry or wet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They argued it and argued it and spat upon the stove,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the non-committal barman on their differences throve.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I state it as a maxim in a loosish kind of way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll have the more to back your word the less you have to say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Public interest was lively, but one Ebenezer Fink</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the Rancho del Jackrabbit, only seemed to sit and think.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>On the memorable evening all the men of Muscatel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came to listen to the logic and the eloquence as well⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All but William Perry Peters, whose attendance there, I fear.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>The human mind as ably as the other, greater gift.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The judges being chosen and the disputants enrolled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The question he proceeded <i xml:lang="la">in extenso</i> to unfold:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<em>Resolved</em>⁠—The sense of hearing lifts the mind up out of reach</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the fogs of error better than the faculty of speech.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This simple proposition he expounded, word by word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until they best understood it who least perfectly had heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even the judges comprehended as he ventured to explain⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The impact of a spit-ball admonishing in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beginning at a period before Creation’s morn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He had reached the bounds of tolerance and Adam yet unborn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As down the early centuries of pre-historic time</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He tracked important principles and quoted striking rhyme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Whisky Bill, prosaic soul! proclaiming him a jay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had risen and like an earthquake, “reeled unheededly away,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a late lamented cat, when opportunity should serve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was preparing to embark upon her parabolic curve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A noise arose outside⁠—the door was opened with a bang</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And old Ebenezer Fink was heard ejaculating “G’lang!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight into that assembly gravely marched without a wink</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An ancient ass⁠—the property it was of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fink.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its ears depressed and beating time to its infestive tread,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent through silence moved amain that stately quadruped!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It stopped before the orator, and in the lamplight thrown</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon its tail they saw that member weighted with a stone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then spake old Ebenezer: “Gents, I heern o’ this debate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On w’ether v’ice or y’ears is best the mind to elevate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now ’yer’s a bird ken throw some light uponto that tough theme:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He has ’em both, I’m free to say, oncommonly extreme.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He wa’n’t invited for to speak, but he will not refuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(If t’other gentleman ken wait) to exposay his views.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ere merriment or anger o’er amazement could prevail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cut the string that held the stone on that canary’s tail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Freed from the weight, that member made a gesture of delight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rose until its rigid length was horizontal quite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lifted head and level ears along his withers laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jack sighed, refilled his lungs and then⁠—to put it mildly⁠—brayed!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He brayed until the stones were stirred in circumjacent hills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sleeping women rose and fled, in divers kinds of frills.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis said that awful bugle-blast⁠—to make the story brief⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wafted William Perry Peters through the window, like a leaf!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such is the tale. If anything additional occurred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis not set down, though, truly, I remember to have heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a gentleman named Peters, now residing at Soquel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A considerable distance from the town of Muscatel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is opposed to education, and to rhetoric, as well.</span>

				<p>
					<span>One thousand years I slept beneath the sod,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My sleep in 1901 beginning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, by the action of some scurvy god</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who happened then to recollect my sinning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was revived and given another inning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On breaking from my grave I saw a crowd⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A formless multitude of men and women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gathered about a ruin. Clamors loud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I heard, and curses deep enough to swim in;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, pointing at me, one said: “Let’s put <em>him</em> in!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then each turned on me with an evil look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in my ragged shroud I stood and shook.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Nay, good Posterity,” I cried, “forbear!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If that’s a jail I fain would be remaining</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside, for truly I should little care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To catch my death of cold. I’m just regaining</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The life lost long ago by my disdaining</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To take precautions against draughts like those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, haply, penetrate that cracked and splitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old structure.” Then an aged wight arose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From a chair of state in which he had been sitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with preliminary coughing, spitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wheezing, said: “ ’Tis not a jail, we’re sure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whate’er it may have been when it was newer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“ ’Twas found two centuries ago, o’ergrown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With brush and ivy, all undoored, ungated;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in restoring it we found a stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Set here and there in the dilapidated</span>

					<span class="i1">And crumbling frieze, inscribed, in antiquated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Big characters, with certain uncouth names,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which we conclude were borne of old by awful</span>

					<span>Rapscallions guilty of all sinful games⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vagrants engaged in purposes unlawful,</span>

					<span>“But why,” I asked, “put mine in?” He replied:</span>

					<span>Right gladly would I then and there have died,</span>

					<span>Praise of to-day than curse of yesteryear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the same lips the honied phrases fall</span>

					<br/>
					<span>We note the shame; you in your depth of dark</span>

					<span>On every honest cheek; your senses all</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">The Royal Jester</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Once on a time, so ancient poets sing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There reigned in Godknowswhere a certain king.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So great a monarch ne’er before was seen:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was a hero, even to his queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In whose respect he held so high a place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That none was higher⁠—nay, not even the ace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was so just his parliament declared</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those subjects happy whom his laws had spared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wise that none of the debating throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had ever lived to prove him in the wrong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So good that Crime his anger never feared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Beauty boldly plucked him by the beard;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So brave that if his army got a beating</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None dared to face him when he was retreating.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This monarch kept a Fool to make his mirth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And loved him tenderly despite his worth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prompted by what caprice I cannot say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He called the Fool before the throne one day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to that minion seriously said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’ll abdicate, and you shall reign instead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I, attired in motley, will make sport</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To entertain your Majesty and Court.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Twas done and the Fool governed. He decreed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The time of harvest and the time of seed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ordered the rains and made the weather clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had a famine every second year;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Altered the calendar to suit his freak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ordaining six whole holidays a week;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Religious creeds and sacred books prepared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made war when angry and made peace when scared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New taxes he imposed; new laws he made;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drowned those who broke them, who observed them, flayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In short, he ruled so well that all who’d not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Been starved, decapitated, hanged or shot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made the whole country with his praises ring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declaring he was every inch a king;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the High Priest averred ’twas very odd</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If one so competent were not a god.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meantime, his master, now in motley clad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wore such a visage, woeful, wan and sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That some condoled with him as with a brother</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, having lost a wife, had got another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Others, mistaking his profession, often</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Approached him to be measured for a coffin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For years this highborn Jester never broke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The silence⁠—he was pondering a joke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last, one day, in cap-and-bells arrayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He strode into the Council and displayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A long, bright smile, that glittered in the gloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like a gilt epitaph within a tomb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Posing his bauble like a leader’s staff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To give the signal when (and why) to laugh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He brought it down with peremptory stroke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And simultaneously cracked his joke!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I can’t repeat it, friends. I ne’er could school</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Myself to quote from any other fool:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A jest, if it were worse than mine, would start</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My tears; if better, it would break my heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, if you please, I’ll hold you but to state</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That royal Jester’s melancholy fate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The insulted nation, so the story goes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose as one man⁠—the very dead arose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Springing indignant from the riven tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And babes unborn leapt swearing from the womb!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All to the Council Chamber clamoring went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By rage distracted and on vengeance bent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In that vast hall, in due disorder laid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tools of legislation were displayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wild populace, its wrath to sate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seized them and heaved them at the Jester’s pate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mountains of writing paper; pools and seas</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ink, awaiting, to become decrees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Royal approval⁠—and the same in stacks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay ready for attachment, backed with wax;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pens to make laws, erasers to amend them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With mucilage convenient to extend them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scissors for limiting their application,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trash-baskets to repeal all legislation⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These, flung as missiles till the air was dense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were most offensive weapons of offense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by their aid the man was nigh destroyed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They ne’er had been so harmlessly employed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whelmed underneath a load of legal cap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His mouth regurgitating ink on tap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyelids mucilaginously sealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His fertile head by scissors made to yield</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abundant harvestage of ears, his pelt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every wrinkle and on every welt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quickset with pencil-points from feet to gills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thickly studded with a pride of quills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The royal Jester in the dreadful strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was made (in short) an editor for life!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>An idle tale, and yet a moral lurks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this as plainly as in greater works.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall not give it birth: one moral here</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would die of loneliness within a year.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Sleep fell upon my senses and I dreamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Long years had circled since my life had fled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world was different, and all things seemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remote and strange, like noises to the dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one great Voice there was; and someone said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Posterity is speaking⁠—rightly deemed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Infallible:” and so I gave attention,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hoping Posterity my name would mention.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Illustrious Spirit,” said the Voice, “appear!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While we confirm eternally thy fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before our dread tribunal answer, here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why do no statues celebrate thy name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No monuments thy services proclaim?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why did not thy contemporaries rear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To thee some schoolhouse or memorial college?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It looks almighty queer, you must acknowledge.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Up spake I hotly: “That is where you err!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But someone thundered in my ear: “You shan’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be interrupting these proceedings, sir;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The question was addressed to General Grant.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some other things were spoken which I can’t</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distinctly now recall, but I infer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By certain flushings of my cheeks and forehead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Posterity’s environment is torrid.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then heard I (this was in a dream, remark)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another Voice, clear, comfortable, strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Grant’s great shade, replying from the dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said in a tone that rang the earth along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thrilled the senses of the judges’ throng:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I’d rather you would question why, in park</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And street, my monuments were not erected</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than why they were.” Then, waking, I reflected.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Ever the foremost in the chase accurst</span>

					<span>The standard of some royal purge display</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ’neath that ensign wage a wasteful fray!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brave tongues are thundering from sea to sea,</span>

					<span>Torrents of sweat roll reeking o’er the lea!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My people perish in their martial fear,</span>

					<span>And rival bagpipes cleave the royal ear!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Now, caitiffs, tremble, for this very hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your injured sovereign shall assert his power!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold this lotion, carefully compound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the poisons you for me have found⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of biting washes such as tan the skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drastic drinks to vex the parts within.</span>

					<span>What aggravates an ailment will produce⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I mean to rub you with this dreadful juice!</span>

					<span>The sovereign ceased, and, sealing what he spoke,</span>

					<span>From Arthur’s Seat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> confirming thunders broke.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wisest and the best of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Betook him to the place where sat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With folded feet upon a mat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of precious stones beneath a palm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In sweet and everlasting calm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That ancient and immortal gent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The God of Rational Content.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As tranquil and unmoved as Fate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deity reposed in state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With palm to palm and sole to sole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And beaded breast and beetling jowl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And belly spread upon his thighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And costly diamonds for eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Chunder Sen approached and knelt</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To show the reverence he felt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then beat his head upon the sod</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To prove his fealty to the god;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then by gestures signified</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other sentiments inside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The god’s right eye (as Chunder Sen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wisest and the best of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half-fancied) grew by just a thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More narrow than it truly ought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet still that prince of devotees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Persistent upon bended knees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And elbows bored into the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declared the god’s exceeding worth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And begged his favor. Then at last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within that cavernous and vast</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thoracic space was heard a sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like that of water underground⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gurgling note that found a vent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At mouth of that Immortal Gent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such a chuckle as no ear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had e’er been privileged to hear!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wisest, greatest, best of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard with a natural surprise</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mighty midriff improvise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greater yet the marvel was</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from between those massive jaws</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell words to make the views more plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The god was pleased to entertain:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So ran the rede in speech of men⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Foremost of mortals in assent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To creed of Rational Content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why come you here to impetrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A blessing on your scurvy pate?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can you not rationally be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Content without disturbing me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Can you not take a hint⁠—a wink⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what of all this rot I think?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is laughter lost upon you quite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To check you in your pious rite?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What! know you not we gods protest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That all religion is a jest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You take me seriously?⁠—you</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About me make a great ado</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(When I but wish to be alone)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With attitudes supine and prone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With genuflections and with prayers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And putting on of solemn airs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To draw my mind from the survey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of Rational Content away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Learn once for all, if learn you can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This truth, significant to man:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A pious person is by odds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one most hateful to the gods.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then stretching forth his great right hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which shadowed all that sunny land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That deity bestowed a touch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which Chunder Sen not overmuch</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enjoyed⁠—a touch divine that made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sufferer hear stars! They played</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sang as on Creation’s morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When spheric harmony was born.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cheeta Raibama Chunder Sen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The most astonished man of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell straight asleep, and when he woke</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The deity nor moved nor spoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sat beneath that ancient palm</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And arm in battle royal to oppose</span>

					<span>A village poet singing through the nose?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No, let them rhyme; I fought them once before</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stilled their songs⁠—but, Satan! how they swore!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cuffed them upon the mouth whene’er their throats</span>

					<span>They cleared for action with their sweetest notes;</span>

					<span>And damned them roundly all along the line;</span>

					<span>’Twas a weary-looking mortal, and he wandered near the portal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the melancholy City of the Discontented Dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was pale and worn exceeding and his manner was unheeding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if it could not matter what he did nor what he said.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sacred stranger”⁠—I addressed him with a reverence befitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The austere, unintermitting, dread solemnity he wore;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis the custom, too, prevailing in that vicinage when hailing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One who possibly may be a person lately “gone before”⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Sacred stranger, much I ponder on your evident dejection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But my carefulest reflection leaves the riddle still unread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How do you yourself explain your dismal tendency to wander</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the melancholy City of the Discontented Dead?”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then that solemn person, pausing in the march that he was making,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Roused himself as if awaking, fixed his dull and stony eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On my countenance and, slowly, like a priest devout and holy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chanted in a mournful monotone the following reply:</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O my brother, do not fear it; I’m no disembodied spirit⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am Lampton, the Slang Poet, with a price upon my head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am watching by this portal for some late lamented mortal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To arise in his disquietude and leave his earthy bed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then I hope to take possession and pull in the earth above me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, renouncing my profession, ne’er be heard of any more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there’s not a soul to love me and no living thing respects me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which so painfully affects me that I fain would ‘go before.’ ”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then I felt a deep compassion for the gentleman’s dejection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For privation of affection would refrigerate a frog.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I said: “If nothing human, and if neither man nor woman</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can appreciate the fashion of your merit buy a dog.”</span>

					<span>Filled with a zeal to serve my fellow men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For years I criticised their prose and verses:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pointed out all their blunders of the pen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their shallowness of thought and feeling; then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Damned them up hill and down with hearty curses!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They said: “That’s all that he can do⁠—just sneer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pull to pieces and be analytic.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why doesn’t he himself, eschewing fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Publish a book or two, and so appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who has the right to be a critic?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Let him who knows it all forbear to tell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How little others know, but <em>show</em> his learning.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then they added: “Who has written well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May censure freely”⁠—quoting Pope. I fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the trap and books began out-turning⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Books by the score⁠—fine prose and poems fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not a book of them but was a terror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were so great and perfect; though I swear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I tried right hard to work in, here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(My nature still forbade) a fault or error.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>’Tis true, some wretches, whom I’d scratched, no doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Professed to find⁠—but that’s a trifling matter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, when the flood of noble books was out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I raised o’er all that land a joyous shout,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I was thought as mad as any hatter!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Why hatters all are mad, I cannot say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twere wrong in their affliction to revile ’em,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truly, you’ll confess ’tis very sad</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We wear the ugly things they make. Begad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They’d be less mischievous in an asylum!)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Consistency, thou art a”⁠—well, you’re <em>paste</em>!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When next I felt my demon in possession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made the field of authorship a waste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All said of me: “What execrable taste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rail at others of his own profession!”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Good Lord! where do the critic’s rights begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who has of literature some clear-cut notion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hears a voice from Heaven say: “Pitch in”?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He finds himself⁠—alas, poor son of sin⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the devil and the deep blue ocean!</span>

				<p>

					<span class="i1">Forgoing even the customary “Who?”⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threw wide the gate and with a friendly grin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said, “ ’Tis a very humble home, but pray walk in.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">The soul smiled pleasantly. “Excuse me, please⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who’s in there?” By insensible degrees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The impudence dispelled the saint’s esteem,</span>

					<span class="i1">As dawning consciousness dispels a dream.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hand to reach for “Whence?” and “Why?” and “How?”</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Twelve groomsmen supported the eminent groom,</span>

					<span>To scowl in his scowl and to gloom in his gloom.</span>

					<span>The rites were performed by the hand and the lip</span>

					<span>Straight at the rear elevation of the luckless culler of simples,</span>

					<span>The foot of Herculean Kilgore⁠—statesman of surname suggestive</span>

					<span>Or carnage unspeakable!⁠—lit like a missile solid, prodigious</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the Congressional door with a monstrous and mighty momentum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Causing that vain ineffective bar to political freedom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To fly from its hinges, effacing the nasal excrescence of Dingley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That luckless one, decently veiling the ruin with ready bandanna,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lamented the loss of his eminence, sadly with sobs as follows:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, why was I ever elected to the halls of legislation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So soon to be shown the door with pitiless emphasis? Truly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve leaned on a broken Reed, and the same has gone back on me meanly.</span>

					<span>Where now is my prominence, erstwhile in council conspicuous, patent?</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Ballad of Pikeville</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Down in Southern Arizona where the Gila monster thrives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the “Mescalero,” gifted with a hundred thousand lives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every hour renounces one of them by drinking liquid flame⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The assassinating wassail that has given him his name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the enterprising dealer in Caucasian hair is seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hold his harvest festival upon the village-green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the late lamented tenderfoot upon the plain is spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a sanguinary circle on the summit of his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where the cactuses (or cacti) lift their lances in the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And incautious jackass-rabbits come to sorrow as they run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lived a colony of settlers⁠—old Missouri was the State</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where they formerly resided at a prehistoric date.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now, the spot that had been chosen for this colonizing scheme</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was as waterless, believe me, as an Arizona stream.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soil was naught but ashes, by the breezes driven free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And an acre and a quarter were required to sprout a pea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So agriculture languished, for the land would not produce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for lack of water, whisky was the beverage in use⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Costly whisky, hauled in wagons many a weary, weary day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mostly needed by the drivers to sustain them on their way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wicked whisky! King of Evils! Why, O, why did God create</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such a curse and thrust it on us in our inoffensive state?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Once a parson came among them, and a holy man was he;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his ailing stomach whisky wouldn’t anywise agree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he knelt upon the mesa and he prayed with all his chin</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the Lord would send them water or incline their hearts to gin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Scarcely was the prayer concluded ere an earthquake shook the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with copious effusion springs burst out on every hand!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Merrily the waters gurgled, and the shock which gave them birth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fitly was by some declared a temperance movement of the earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Astounded by the miracle, the people met that night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To celebrate it properly by some religious rite;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ’tis truthfully recorded that before the moon had sunk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every man and every woman was devotionally drunk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A half a standard gallon (says history) per head</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the best Kentucky prime was at that ceremony shed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, the glory of that country! O, the happy, happy folk</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the might of prayer delivered from Nature’s iron yoke!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo! the plains to the horizon all are yellowing with rye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the corn upon the hill-top lifts its banners to the sky!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gone the wagons, gone the drivers, and the road is grown to grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over which the incalescent Bourbon did aforetime pass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pikeville (that’s the name they’ve given, in their wild, romantic way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To that irrigation district) now distills, statistics say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something like a hundred gallons, out of each recurrent crop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the head of population⁠—and consumes it, every drop!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The weather, I mean. “You are twins”?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why, that was evident at the start,</span>

					<span class="i1">From the way that you paint your head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In stripes of purple and red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">With dots of yellow.</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Your lot is the common lot of all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Horses are trees and the moon is a sneeze”?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, I fancy, is just as you please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some think that way, and others hold</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i3">I never quite knew,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i3">Are a liberal education,</span>

					<span>And your clothes, including the metal hat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the brazen boots⁠—what’s that?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“You never could stomach a Democrat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since General Jackson ran?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’re another sort, but you predict</span>

				<section id="dies-irae-preface" epub:type="preface">
					<p>A recent republication of the late <abbr>Gen.</abbr> John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Dix’s disappointing translation of this famous medieval hymn, together with some researches into its history, which I happened to be making at the time, induces me to undertake a translation myself. It may seem presumption in me to attempt that which so many eminent scholars of so many generations have attempted before me; but failure of others encourages me to hope that success, being still unachieved, is still achievable. The fault of many translations, from Lord Macaulay’s to that of <abbr>Gen.</abbr> Dix, has been, I venture to think, a too strict literalness, whereby the delicate irony and subtle humor of the immortal poem⁠—though doubtless these admirable qualities were valued by the translators⁠—have been sacrificed in the result. In none of the English versions that I have examined is more than a trace of the mocking spirit of insincerity pervading the whole prayer⁠—the cool effrontery of the suppliant in enumerating his demerits, his serenely illogical demands of salvation in spite, or rather because, of them, his meek submission to the punishment of others, and the many similarly pleasing characteristics of this amusing work being most imperfectly conveyed. By permitting myself a reasonable freedom of rendering⁠—in many cases boldly supplying that “missing link” between the sublime and the ridiculous which the author, writing for the acute monkish apprehension of the thirteenth century, did not deem it necessary to insert⁠—I have hoped at least partly to liberate the lurking devil of humor from his letters, letting him caper, not, certainly, as he does in the Latin, but as he probably would have done had his creator written in English. In preserving the meter and trochaic rhymes of the original, I have acted from the same reverent regard for the music with which, in the liturgy of the Church, the verses have become inseparably wedded that inspired <abbr>Gen.</abbr> Dix; seeking rather to surmount the obstacles to success by honest effort, than to avoid them by adopting an easier versification which would have deprived my version of all utility in religious service.</p>
					<p>I must bespeak the reader’s charitable consideration in respect of the first stanza, the insuperable difficulties of which seem to have been purposely contrived in order to warn off trespassers at the very boundary of the alluring domain. I have got over the inhibition⁠—somehow⁠—but David and the Sibyl must try to forgive me if they find themselves represented merely by the names of those conspicuous personal qualities to which they probably owed their powers of prophecy, as Samson’s strength lay in his hair.</p>

				<p>
					<span>Ten square leagues of rolling ground</span>

					<span>A rat who’d gorged a box of bane</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suffered an internal pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came from his hole to die (the label</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Required it if the rat were able)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found outside his habitat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A limpid stream. Of bane and rat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas all unconscious; in the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It ran and prattled just for fun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keen to allay his inward throes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beast immersed his filthy nose</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And drank⁠—then, bloated by the stream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And filled with superheated steam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exploded with a rascal smell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remarking, as his fragments fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Astonished in the brook: “I’m thinking</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This water’s damned unwholesome drinking!”</span>

					<span>Well, I’ve met her again⁠—at the Mission.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She’d told me to see her no more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was not a command⁠—a petition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’d granted it once before.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, granted it, hoping she’d write me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Repenting her virtuous freak⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Subdued myself daily and nightly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the better part of a week.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And then (’twas my duty to spare her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The shame of recalling me) I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just sought her again to prepare her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For an everlasting good-bye.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O, that evening of bliss⁠—shall I ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cease living it over?⁠—although</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She said, when ’twas ended: “You’re never</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see me again. And now go.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As we parted with kisses ’twas human</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And natural for me to smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I thought, “She’s in love, and a woman:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She’ll send for me after a while.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But she didn’t; and so⁠—well, the old Mission</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is fine, picturesque and gray;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis an excellent place for contrition⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sometimes she passes that way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That’s how it occurred that I met her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that’s all there is to tell⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Except that I’d like to forget her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Calm way of remarking: “I’m well.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It was hardly worth while, all this keying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul to such tensions and stirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To learn that her food was agreeing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With that little stomach of hers.</span>

					<span>Well, well, old Father Christmas, is it you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With your thick neck and thin pretense of virtue?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less redness in the nose⁠—nay, even some blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would not, I think, particularly hurt you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When seen close to, not mounted in your car,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You look the drunkard and the pig you are.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No matter, sit you down, for I am not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In a gray study, as you sometimes find me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Merry? O, no, nor wish to be, God wot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But there’s another year of pain behind me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That’s something to be thankful for: the more</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are behind, the fewer are before.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I know you, Father Christmas, for a scamp,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Heaven endowed me at my soul’s creation</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With an affinity to every tramp</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That walks the world and steals its admiration.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For admiration is, like linen left</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the line⁠—got easiest by theft.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Good God! old man, just think of it! I’ve stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With brains and honesty, some five-and-twenty</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long years as champion of all that’s good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And taken on the mazzard thwacks a-plenty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet now whose praises do the people bawl?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those of the fellows whom I live to maul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why, this is odd!⁠—the more I try to talk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of you, the more my tongue grows egotistic</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To prattle of myself! I’ll try to balk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its waywardness and be more altruistic.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So let us speak of others⁠—how they sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what a devil of a state they’re in!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>That’s all I have to say. Good-bye, old man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next year you possibly may find me scolding⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or miss me altogether: Nature’s plan</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Includes, as I suppose, a final folding</span>

					<span>Of these poor empty hands. Then drop a tear</span>

					<span>That slumber-of-the-morning brings:</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The love of women (mostly those</span>

				<p>
					<span>War⁠—what a hero I became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By merely dreaming battle!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Athwart the field of letters, Fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blared through the brass my weary name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With an ominous death-rattle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Such an eternity of thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within a minute’s fraction!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such phantoms out of nothing wrought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fading suddenly to naught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I awake to action!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They scamper each into its hole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These dreams of my begetting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They’ve had their moment; take, my soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy day of life.⁠ ⁠… Gods! this is droll⁠—</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Basilica</h3>
				<p>
					<span>With aimless feet, along the verge</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ocean, where the rocks emerge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I strolled, and watched the baffled surge.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In sheltered channels at my feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sleepy ripples crisping neat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slid in and out with sluicy beat.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The groaning sea, wind-smitten white⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The day, shot through with throbbing light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lay palpitating on my sight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From bloody death of stricken day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ocean’s leprous agony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My weary eyes I drew away,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To where the rocks the margin mar</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of waters where the shadows are⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw the smiling of a star.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Imbedded deep in mossy green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A glinting gem with lustrous sheen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Burnt wondrous with a flame serene,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My soul grew drunken with its ray⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like liquid April filing May,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its wing-light suffused the day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And day became⁠—with colors cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New-drowned in beauties manifold⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An opal chalice brimming gold.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A silent music clove the air⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A spirit bent in worship there⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My wish had wrought itself a prayer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“O, if thy beauty, radiant stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be not rejected love alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By wooing skies upon thee thrown;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But rather a desire intense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appealing thus to human sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With more than human eloquence;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If so thou strivest to impart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The aspirations at thy heart⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pulsing a wish with every spark;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Give me to claim thy sacred ray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll bear thee from thy shades away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And set thee in the perfect day.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I’ll niche thee in a shrine made fair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With wondrous woods and metals rare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dim with amber-tinted air.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And sculpted work of quaint device,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gem-tinct with gleams of prismic ice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lamps antique of fabled price⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And droning troops of monkish bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With censers filled at spicy trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall minister on bended knees.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Grey darkness fell upon the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With hasty clutch my eager hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To snatch the gem from barren strand</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Essayed. When, Lo! with stiffened hair⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vision smit with baleful glare⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hope sharp-freezing to despair,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With heart compressed as in a vice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forehead bound with sudden ice⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I grasped a hidden Cockatrice.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O, with Heart of Stone with eyes of light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ivory throat of pallid white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And snaky folds concealed from sight⁠—</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With jeweled teeth, alas! and breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose touch to passion ministreth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweet-spiced with aromatic death!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No pen of poison, gall-immersed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of deadly sins can name thy worst;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or fitly curse thy race accursed.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">A Mystery</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A thing to be thought with abated breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And named with tears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There ever shall be as there ever have been,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond our ken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The weight of the Past with its burden of sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A shadow thrown from the Future within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the souls of men.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the weight unfelt and the shadow unseen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the cry of the Present unheard between,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is all of life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ’tis only through toil and the nameless pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of wishes forever unwished again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By an aimless strife⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As who should do battle with weapon of steel</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the fleshless Dark which he cannot feel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it hedges him round⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That peace is found.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thinkst thou that “to smile” is the same as “to live,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a life shall receive what it need not give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That toil is toil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That a fruitful future unmoistened by tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brings harvest of ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wine and oil?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, Dreamer of Dreams, there forever shall be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A blossomless growth in the spirit of thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still draping in gloom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each fairy façade of each castle so fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By thy fancy upreared in the roseate air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As ivy a tomb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis rooted in life and its fruit is of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the prisoned breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In its baleful shadow, still shudders and moans</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In voiceless tones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wouldst thou know, O mortal, the secret of Pain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis the payment in blood for each wish we obtain.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Lithesome, blithesome daughter mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lift to me those lips of thine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Greet me with those eyes of blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eyes which seem to look me through:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Flashing now with life and light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now in hush of sleep reposing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Veiled by lashes dark as night⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shadows over violets closing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come thou, o’er me softly bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shower on me fond caresses;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er my cheek, and on my brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fling thy wealth of sunbright tresses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every throbbing pulse of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beats in time and tune to thine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All my heart’s tide sets to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Loving little Rosalie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As the dewdrop doth the flower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the sunshine doth the hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the music of thy voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Makes my soul rejoice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the livelong day around</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Babbles on thy childlike chatter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mingled with the pleasant sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes thy little foot’s light patter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like the linnet’s on the thorn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Joyously thy carol floweth⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sing, my bird, for thy young morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No dark night of winter knoweth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blue-eyed romp, in ceaseless whirl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Half the angel, half the girl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the child art thou to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laughing little Rosalie.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Loved one mine, the sunny day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passeth rapidly away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All too soon the bright time goes⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All too fast life’s current flows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now its fairy waters glide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where the sunbeams o’er it quiver;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon the salt waves meet its tide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon the beck will be the river⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine is now the primrose spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine the bluebell in the meadows:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine the fading hours that fling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Autumn leaves and lengthening shadows;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet my day lights up awhile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Neath the sunshine of thy smile⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou dost bring new life to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lithesome, blithesome Rosalie.</span>

					<span>The heliotrope’s fragrant breath⁠—</span>

					<span>The subtle sweet of jasmine on the evening air⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flowery mead, all radiant</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The mingled joy and anguish thrilling us</span>

					<span>In the weird plaints of Schubert⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great Rossini’s heaven-born strains⁠—</span>

				<p>
					<span>Listen, maiden, to my strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Listen, pray thee, do!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darkness shrouds the gloomy plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And our moon is on the wane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet this fog cools not my brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis on fire anew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>List! and from thy couch arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rise, dear, pray thee do!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not to gaze on murky skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That were now nor well nor wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because your lover tries</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To catch sight of you!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Draw that dismal curtain back⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Draw it back, duck, do!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis like these clouds, whose flimsy rack</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hides yon bright moon’s silvery track,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’d rather <em>see</em> the window black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And know it bright to you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let me see those love-lit eyes⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let me, sweet; now, do-o-o!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lit by them these misty skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er would wish the moon to rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the stars, like scared fire-flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would hide deep in the blue.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Come, dear, dup that tiresome door⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dup the door, duck, do-oo-o!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let me love afar no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing in the fog’s a bore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sooth to say my throat is sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hoarse I’m getting too.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let me to thy chamber creep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let me creep up, do-oo-oo!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll not again disturb thy sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor more before thy window weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listen, love, and do not keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me longer in the dew.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Listen, maiden, to my song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Listen, now come, do-oo-oo-oo!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do not deem my rhyming wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’m not of the ribald throng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let me in, I merely long</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To read my rhymes to you.</span>
