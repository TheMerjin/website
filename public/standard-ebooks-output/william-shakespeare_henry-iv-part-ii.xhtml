This same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he hath done about Turnbull Street; and every third word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk’s tribute. I do remember him at Clement’s Inn like a man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a’ was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it with a knife: a’ was so forlorn, that his dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a’ was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a’ came ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those tunes to the over-scutched huswives that he heard the carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or his good-nights. And now is this Vice’s dagger become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and I’ll be sworn a’ ne’er saw him but once in the Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding among the marshal’s men. I saw it, and told John a Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I’ll be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall go hard but I will make him a philosopher’s two stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I may snap at him.

							<td>I would you had but the wit: ’twere better than your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make him laugh; but that’s no marvel, he drinks no wine. There’s never none of these demure boys come to any proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a kind of male green-sickness; and then when they marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold operation in it. It ascends me into the brain; dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive, quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes, which, delivered o’er to the voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second property of your excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood; which, before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme: it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain, the heart, who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till sack commences it and sets it in act and use. Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land, manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I would teach them should be, to forswear thin potations and to addict themselves to sack.</td>

									<span>But as an honour snatch’d with boisterous hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I had many living to upbraid</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My gain of it by their assistances;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou see’st with peril I have answered;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For all my reign hath been but as a scene</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Acting that argument: and now my death</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So thou the garland wear’st successively.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet, though thou stand’st more sure than I could do,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have but their stings and teeth newly ta’en out;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By whose fell working I was first advanced</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And by whose power I well might lodge a fear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To be again displaced: which to avoid,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I cut them off; and had a purpose now</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To lead out many to the Holy Land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lest rest and lying still might make them look</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Be it thy course to busy giddy minds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>May waste the memory of the former days.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More would I, but my lungs are wasted so</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That strength of speech is utterly denied me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How I came by the crown, O God forgive;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And grant it may with thee in true peace live!</span>

It is a wonderful thing to see the semblable coherence of his men’s spirits and his: they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is turned into a justice-like serving-man: their spirits are so married in conjunction with the participation of society that they flock together in consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the imputation of being near their master: if to his men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man could better command his servants. It is certain that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is caught, as men take diseases, one of another: therefore let men take heed of their company. I will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two actions, and a’ shall laugh without intervallums. O, it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never had the ache in his shoulders!

									<span>You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I do wish your honours may increase,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till you do live to see a son of mine</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Offend you and obey you, as I did.</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>That dares do justice on my proper son;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And not less happy, having such a son,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That would deliver up his greatness so</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Into the hands of justice.” You did commit me:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For which, I do commit into your hand</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The unstained sword that you have used to bear;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With this remembrance, that you use the same</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With the like bold, just and impartial spirit</span>

									<br/>

									<span>To your well-practised wise directions.</span>

									<span>To mock the expectation of the world,</span>

									<span>Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where it shall mingle with the state of floods</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And flow henceforth in formal majesty.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now call we our high court of parliament:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That the great body of our state may go</span>

							<p>First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech. My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty; and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring. But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your patience for it and to promise you a better. I meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you I would be and here I commit my body to your mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and, as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</p>
							<p>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a good conscience will make any possible satisfaction, and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which was never seen before in such an assembly.</p>
							<p>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat, unless already a’ be killed with your hard opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</p>

								<span>And who but Rumour, who but only I,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Make fearful musters and prepared defence,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And of so easy and so plain a stop</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The still-discordant wavering multitude,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My well-known body to anatomize</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I run before King Harry’s victory;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Even with the rebels’ blood. But what mean I</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To speak so true at first? my office is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur’s sword,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that the king before the Douglas’ rage</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stoop’d his anointed head as low as death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This have I rumour’d through the peasant towns</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where Hotspur’s father, old Northumberland,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And not a man of them brings other news</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Than they have learn’d of me: from Rumour’s tongues</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than true wrongs. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></span>
