									<br/>
									<span>With forty other serviceable knights,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Under safe-conduct of the Dauphin’s seal</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did travel that way, finding him distress’d,</span>

									<span>A troop of lances met us on the way,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Surpris’d, and brought us prisoners to the king;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who, proud of this and eager of revenge,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Commanded straight to cut off all our heads:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And surely we had died, but that the duke,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>More full of honour than his angry sire,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Did thrice so much increase our heaviness:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For there, my lord, O, there we did descry</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Down in a valley how both armies lay.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The French had cast their trenches like a ring;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And every barricado’s open front</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was thick emboss’d with brazen ordinance.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here stood a battaile of ten thousand horse;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There twice as many pikes, in quadrant-wise:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here cross-bows and deadly-wounding darts:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in the midst, like to a slender point</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Within the compass of the horizon⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As ’twere a rising bubble in the sea,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A hazel-wand amidst a wood of pines,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or as a bear fast chain’d unto a stake⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Stood famous Edward, still expecting when</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Those dogs of France would fasten on his flesh.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Anon, the death-procuring knell begins:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Off go the cannons, that, with trembling noise,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did shake the very mountain where they stood;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then sound the trumpets’ clangour in the air,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The battles join: and, when we could no more</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Discern the difference ’twixt the friend and foe,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>(So intricate the dark confusion was)</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Away we turn’d our wat’ry eyes, with sighs</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As black as powder fuming into smoke.</span>
