									<span>This battle fares like to the morning’s war,</span>

									<span>What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Can neither call it perfect day nor night.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Now one the better, then another best;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:</span>

									<span>So is the equal poise of this fell war.</span>

									<span>To be no better than a homely swain;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To sit upon a hill, as I do now,</span>

									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>How many days will finish up the year;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How many years a mortal man may live.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When this is known, then to divide the times:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I tend my flock;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I take my rest;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I contemplate;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many hours must I sport myself;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many days my ewes have been with young;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Pass’d over to the end they were created,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than doth a rich embroider’d canopy</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To kings that fear their subjects’ treachery?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, yes, it doth; a thousandfold it doth.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And to conclude, the shepherd’s homely curds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>His wonted sleep under a fresh tree’s shade,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,</span>

									<span>His viands sparkling in a golden cup,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Applaud the name of Henry with your leader. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">They all cry, “Henry!”</i></span>
