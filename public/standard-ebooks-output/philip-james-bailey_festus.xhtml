				<span>Read this, world! He who writes is dead to thee,</span>

				<span class="i1">But still lives in these leaves. He spake inspired:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Night and day, thought came unhelped, undesired,</span>

				<br/>
				<span>A prize than, in his own torn heart, to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A few bright seeds: he sowed them⁠—hoped them truth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The autumn of that seed is in these pages.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface to the American Edition</h2>
			<p>We here present to the American public a book which has produced no little sensation in England, and which has been, for some time, known to many in this country. But although the first edition was issued six years since, it has had but a limited circulation among us; and it is believed that in republishing <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Festus</i>, we not only perform a work which its merits demand, but open, for the first time, to many who will appreciate it, a great and original poem. The peculiar value of the second English edition, from which this is printed, consists in the “Proem,” which was not attached to the first. Having placed at the end of the volume some of the highest literary opinions in England, we will not intrude any analysis of our own. But a word upon one point With many minds, it will be difficult to acquit the author from the charge of irreverence. For this purpose, we refer to his vindication in the “Proem” and in the body of the work; by which the reader will perceive that he is free from irreverence in spirit, whatever question there may be as to the propriety of certain forms of expression. As to the extravagances, which all will discover, they are the extravagances of deep and eloquent passion⁠—the luxuriant overgrowth of a profoundly rich soil. With all its faults, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Festus</i> is a great poem⁠—a mine of thought and imagery. It is perfectly safe to pronounce it one of the most powerful and splendid productions of the age.</p>

			<p>
				<span>Without all fear, without presumption, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wrote this work would speak respecting it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A few brief words, and face his friend the world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Revising, not reversing, what hath been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poetry is itself a thing of God;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made His prophets poets; and the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We feel of poesie do we become</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like God in love and power⁠—under-makers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All great lays, equals to the minds of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deal more or less with the Divine, and have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For end some good of mind or soul of man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mind is this world’s, but the soul is God’s;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wise man joins them here all in his power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The high and holy works, amid lesser lays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stand up like churches among village cots;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And it is joy to think that in every age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However much the world was wrong therein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greatest works of mind or hand have been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Done unto God. So may they ever be!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It shows the strength of wish we have to be great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sublime humility of might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>True fiction hath in it a higher end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than fact; it is the possible compared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With what is merely positive, and gives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the conceptive soul an inner world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A higher, ampler, Heaven than that wherein</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nations sun themselves. In that bright state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are met the mental creatures of the men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose names are writ highest on the rounded crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Fame’s triumphal arch; the shining shapes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which star the skies of that invisible land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, whosoe’er would enter, let him learn;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis not enough to draw forms fair and lively,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their conduct likewise must be beautiful;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hearty holiness must crown the work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a gold cross the minster-dome, and show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like that instonement of divinity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That the whole building doth belong to God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for the book before us, though it were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What it is not, supremely little, like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The needled angle of a high church spire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its sole end points to God the Father’s glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all eternity seen; making clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His might and love in saving sinful man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One bard shows God as He deals with states and kings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another, as He dealt with the first man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another, as with Heaven and earth and hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ours, as He loves to order a chance soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chosen out of the world, from first to last.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all along it is the heart of man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Emblemed, created and creative mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a statued mind and naked heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is struck out. Other bards draw men dressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In manners, customs, forms, appearances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laws, places, times, and countless accidents</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of peace or polity: to him these are not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He makes no mention, takes no compt of them:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But shows, however great his doubts, sins, trials,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever earthborn pleasures soil man’s soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What power soever he may gain of evil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That still, till death, time is; that God’s great Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands open day and night to man and spirit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all are of the race of God, and have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In themselves good. The life-writ of a heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose firmest prop and highest meaning was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hope of serving God as poet-priest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the belief that He would not put back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-offerings, though brought to Him by hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unclean and earthy, e’en as fallen man’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must be; and most of all, the thankful show</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of His high power and goodness in redeeming</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blessing souls that love Him, spite of sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their old earthy strain⁠—these are the aims,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The doctrines, truths, and staple of the story.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What theme sublimer than soul being, saved?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis the bard’s aim to show the mind-made world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without, within; how the soul stands with God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the unseen realities about us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a view of life spiritual</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And earthly. Let all look upon it, then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the same light it was drawn and colored in;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In faith, in that the writer too hath faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit an effect, and not a cause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith is a higher faculty than reason,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though of the brightest power of revelation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the snow-headed mountain rises o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lightning, and applies itself to Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We know in day-time there are stars about us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just as at night, and name them what and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By sight of science; so by faith we know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although we may not see them till our night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That spirits are about us, and believe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, to a spirit’s eye, all Heaven may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As full of angels as a beam of light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of motes. As spiritual, it shows all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Classes of life, perhaps, above our kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Known to tradition, reason, or God’s word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose bright foundations are the heights of Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As earthly, it embodies most the life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of youth, its powers, its aims, its deeds, its failings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as a sketch of world-life, it begins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ends, and rightly, in Heaven and with God;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Heaven is also in the midst thereof.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God, or all good, the evil of the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And man, wherein are both, are each displayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mortal is the model of all men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foibles, follies, trials, sufferings⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And manifest and manifold are they⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a young, hot, unworld-schooled heart that has</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had its own way in life, and wherein all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May see some likeness of their own⁠—’tis these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Attract, unite, and, sunlike, concentrate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ever-moving system of our feelings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hero is the world-man, in whose heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One passion stands for all, the most indulged.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scenes wherein he plays his part are life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sphere whose centre is co-heavenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With its divine original and end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like life, too, as a whole, the story hath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A moral, and each scene one, as in life⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One universal and peculiar truth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining upon it like the quiet moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Illustrating the obscure unequal earth;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though these scenes may seem to careless eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Irregular and rough and unconnected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like to the stones at Stonehenge⁠—though convolved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in primeval mystery⁠—still an use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A meaning, and a purpose may be marked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among them of a temple reared to God:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The meaning alway dwelling in the word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In secret sanctity, like a golden toy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid Beauty’s orbed bosom. Scenes of earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Heaven are mixed, as flesh and soul in man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now, the religion of the book is this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed out from the book God writ of old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All creatures being faulty by their nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by God made all liable to sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God only could atone⁠—and unto none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except Himself⁠—for universal sin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is thus that God did sacrifice to God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself unto Himself, in the great way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Triune mystery. His death, as man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was real as our own; and as, except</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the destruction of all life, there could</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be no atonement for its sin, while life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doth necessarily result from God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thought and outward action from ourselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the atonement must be to and by Him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which makes it justice equally with love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all His powers and attributes are equal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And must make one in any act of His;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every act of God is infinite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He acts through all in all: the truth we know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He doth Himself inbreathe; the ill we do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He hath atoned for; and the scriptures show</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That God doth suffer for the sins of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom He hath made, that are liable to sin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all of us He hath His agony;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We are the cross, and death of God, and grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him love then all the more, and worship Him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lived and died, and rose from death for us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And is and reigns forever God in all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let each man think himself an act of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mind a thought, his life a breath of God;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let each try, by great thoughts and good deeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show the most of Heaven he hath in him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many who read the word of life, much doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether salvation be of grace or faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Election, or repentance, or good works,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or God’s high will: reconcile all of them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each of the persons of the Triune God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath had His dispensation, hath it now;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Father by His prophets, and the Son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In His own days, by His own deeds; and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Spirit, by the ministry of Christ;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus, by law, by gospel, and by grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scheme of God’s salvation is complete.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Salvation, then, is God-like, threefold; so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That under one or other, all may come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By will of God alone, by faith in Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by repentance, and good works, and grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So there is one salvation of the Father,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of the Son, another of the Spirit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each, the salvation of the Three in One.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mortal in this lay is saved of will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In manner as this hymn unfolds, which hath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Just warranty for every word from God’s.</span>

			<p>
				<span>These principles and doctrines pending not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the action of the poem here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But over and above it, influencing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nevertheless the story, as the course</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of stars enwoven with our system, earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vary the view of this life’s hemisphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mingle it more palpably with Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with its changeless, ceaseless, boundless God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is thus that by creating to and from</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eternity, and multiplying ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own one Being through the universe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He doth eternize happiness, and make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good infinite by making all in Him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is but one great right and good; and ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrong are shades thereof, not substances.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing can be antagonist to God.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Necessity, like electricity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is in ourselves and all things, and no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without us than within us; and we live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We of this mortal mixture, in the same law</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the pure colourless intelligence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which dwells in Heaven, and the dead Hadëan shades.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will and act and talk of liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all our wills and all our doings both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are limited within this little life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free will is but necessity in play⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clattering of the golden reins which guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thunder-footed coursers of the sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ship which goes to sea informed with fire⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obeying only its own iron force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reckless of adverse tide, breeze dead, or weak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As infant’s parting breath, too faint to stir</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feather held before it⁠—is as much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The appointed thrall of all the elements,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the white-bosomed bark which wooes the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when it dies desists. And thus with man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However contrary he set his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To God, he is but working out His will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, at an infinite angle, more or less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obeying his own soul’s necessity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He only hath freewill whose will is fate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Evil and good are God’s right hand and left.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By ministry of evil good is clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by temptation virtue; as of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the grave rose God. Let this be deemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enough to justify the portion weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great spirit Evil, named herein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If evil seem the most, yet good most is:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As water may be deep and pure below</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Although the face be filmy for a time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if the spirit of evil seem more in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The work than God, it is but to work His will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who therefore is all that the, other seems.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And evil is in almost every scene</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of life more or less forward. Above all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mystery of the Trinity is held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose mystery is its reasonableness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that is said of Deity is said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In love and reverence. Be it so conceived.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What comes before and after the great world⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep in the secretest abyss of Light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Being’s most reserved immensity⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God alone knows eternally, who rends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mantling Heavens with his hands; but with</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The present is communion creatural:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He liveth in the sacrament of life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for the soul of man delineate here⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The outline half invisible⁠—is shown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The self-sought grace, the self-aspiring truth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And natural religion of the heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contrasting Godhood with humanity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever; whereas the Spirit aye unites.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Temptation, and its workings in the heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose faint and false resistance but assists⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambition, thirst of secret lore, joy, love⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Riverlike, doubling sometimes on itself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adventure, pleasure, travel heavenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And earthly, friendship, passion, poesie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Viewed ever in their spiritual end⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And power, celestial happiness and earth’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Millenial foretaste, ill annihilate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The restoration of the angels lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one salvation universal given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all create⁠—all these, related, form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With much beside, the body of the work:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The islands, seas, and mainland of its orb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus much then for this book. It aims to mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The various belief as well as doubts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which hold or search by turns the mind of youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unresting anywhere. Its heresies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If such they be, are charitable ones;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For they who read not in the blest belief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all souls may be saved, read to no end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We were made to be saved. We are of God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor bates the book one tittle of the truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To smoothe its way to favour with the fearful.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All rests with those who read. A work or thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is what each makes it to himself, and may</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be full of great dark meanings, like the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shoals of life rushing; or like the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Benighted with the wing of the wild dove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweepng miles broad o’er the far western woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With mighty glimpses of the central light⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or may be nothing⁠—bodiless, spiritless.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now therefore to his work and to the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The writer bids, God speed! It matters not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If they agree or differ. Each perchance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May bear true witness to another end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let then what hath been, be. It boots not here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To palliate misdoings. ’Twere less toil</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To build Colossus than to hew a hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into a statue. Hail and farewell, all!</span>

								<br/>
								<span>The virgin tremor, the heart’s ebb and flow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When first some vast temptation calmly comes</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And states itself before it, like the sun</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Low looming in the west, above the wave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of wimpling streamlet, ere its waters grow</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To size aortal. Than the Fiend himself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is no greater evil. Less the shame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of yielding, more the glory of conquering,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In him, to whom he goes, this soul elect.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From infancy through childhood, up to youth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have I this soul attended; marked him blest</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With all the sweet and sacred ties of life;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The prayerful love of parents, pride of friends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Prosperity, and health and ease, the aids</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of learning, social converse with the good</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And gifted, and his heart all-lit with love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to the rolling sea with living light;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hopeful and generous and earnest; rich</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In commune with high spirits, loving truth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And wisdom for their own divinest selves:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tracking the deeds of the world’s glory, or</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Conning the words of wisdom, Heaven-inspired,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As on the soul, in pure effectual ray,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bright, transparent atoms, thought by thought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fall fixed for evermore. And thus his days,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Through sunny noon, or mooned eve, or night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Star-armied, shining through the deathless air,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All radiantly elapsed, in good or joy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All this, for long, I marked. There grew, at length,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A change within his spirit; and I feared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A fatal and a final fall from good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God’s love seemed lost upon him. He became</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Heart-deadened. Watching, warning, vain, I fled</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hither to intercede with God our Lord,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To bless him with salvation. We may plead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alway for those we love, by leave divine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor knew I till this moment, with all Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That, in the righteous providence of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That soul was saved. Thou knowest, Lord! the mould</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of mortals, and the infinite end whereto</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The souls Thou savest are predestinate;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! be Thy mercy mighty to this soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fiend-threatened; nor permit him who presides</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er Hell’s eternal holocaust, too far</span>

								<span>In it came⁠—glanced upon a glowing page,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where, youth forestalling and foreshortening age⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Weak with the work of thought, a boyish bard,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sat suing night and stars for his reward.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sunbeam swerved and grew, a breathing, dim,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the first time, as it lit and looked on him:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His forehead faded⁠—pale his lip and dry⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hollow his cheek⁠—and fever fed his eye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Clouds lay about his brain, as on a hill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quick with the thunder thought, and lightning will.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His clenched hand shook from its more than midnight clasp,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till his pen fluttered like a winged asp,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save that no deadly poison blacked its lips:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twas his to life-enlighten, not eclipse;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor would he shade one atom of another,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To have a sun his slave, a god his brother.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The young moon laid her down as one who dies,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Knowing that death can be no sacrifice,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For that the sun, her god, through nature’s night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall make her bosom to grow great with light.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Still he sat, though his lamp sunk; and he strained</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His eyes to work the nightness which remained.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Vain pain! he could not make the light he wanted,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And soon thought’s wizard ring gets disenchanted.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When earth was dayed⁠—was morrowed⁠—the first ray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Perched on his pen, and diamonded its way;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sunray that I watched; which, proud to mark</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The line it loved as deathless, there died dark⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Died in the only path it would have trod,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were there as many ways as worlds to God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There, in the eye of God again to burn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As all man’s glory unto God’s must turn.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so may sunbeams ever guide his pen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And God his heart, who lights the morn of men;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For this life is but Being’s first faint ray;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sun on sun, and heaven on heaven, make up God’s day.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And were there suns in day as stars in night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They would show but like one ray from out His full-sphered light;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As but one momentary gleam would fly;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or, as years, the arrows of eternity.</span>

								<span>Poets are all who love⁠—who feel great thruths⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And tell them; and the truth of truths is love.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There was a time⁠—oh, I remember well!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When, like a sea-shell with its seaborn strain,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My soul aye rang with music of the lyre;</span>

								<br/>
								<span>A honey dew, and throve on what it shed.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All things I loved; but song I loved in chief.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Imagination is the air of mind;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Judgment its earth, and memory its main;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Passion its fire. I was at home in Heaven;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Swiftlike I lived above: once touching earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The meanest thing might master me: long wings</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But baffled. Still and still I harped on song.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! to create within the mind is bliss;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, shaping forth the lofty thought, or lovely,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We seek not, need not Heaven: and when the thought⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cloudy and shapeless, first forms on the mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Slow darkening into, some gigantic make,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How the heart shakes with pride and fear, as heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quakes under its own thunder: or as might,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of old, the mortal mother of a god,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When first she saw him lessening up the skies.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I began the toil divine of verse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which like a burning-bush, doth guest a god.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But this was only wing-flapping⁠—not flight;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The pawing of the courser ere he win;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till, by degrees, from wrestling with my soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I gathered strength to keep the fleet thoughts fast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And made them bless me. Yes, there was a time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When tomes of ancient song held eye and heart⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were the sole lore I recked of: the great bards</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Greece, of Rome, and mine own master land,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And they who in the holy book are deathless⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who have vulgarized sublimity,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bought up truth for the nations; parted it,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As soldiers lotted once the garb of God⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who have forged gods⁠—uttered⁠—made them pass:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In whose words, to be read with many a heaving</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the heart, is a power, like wind in rain⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sons of the sons of God, who, in olden days,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Did leave their passionless Heaven for earth and woman,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Brought an immortal to a mortal breast;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, like a rainbow clasping the sweet earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And melting in the covenant of love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Left here a bright precipitate of soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which lives for ever through the lines of men,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Flashing, by fits, like fire from an enemy’s front⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose thoughts, like bars of sunshine in shut rooms,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mid gloom, all glory, win the world to light⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who make their very follies like their souls;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, like the young moon with a ragged edge,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Still, in their imperfection, beautiful⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose weaknesses are lovely as their strengths.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the white nebulous matter between stars,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which, if not lights at least is likest light⁠—</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Through every limb and the whole heart; whose words</span>

								<span>Haunt us as eagles haunt the mountain air;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thoughts which command all coming times and minds,</span>

								<span>As from a tower a warden⁠—fix themselves</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deep in the heart as meteor stones in earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dropped from some higher sphere; the words of gods,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fragments of the undeemed tongues of Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who walk up to fame as to a friend</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or their own house, which from the wrongful heir</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They have wrested, from the world’s hard hand and gripe⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men who, like Death, all bone, but all unarmed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have ta’en the giant world by the throat, and thrown him;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And made him swear to maintain their name and fame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At peril of his life⁠—who shed great thoughts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As easily as an oak looseneth its golden leaves</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a kindly largess to the soil it grew on⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose rich dark ivy thoughts, sunned o’er with love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Flourish around the deathless stems of their names⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose names are ever on the world’s broad tongue,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like sound upon the falling of a force⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose words, if winged, are with angels’ wings⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who play upon the heart as on a harp,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And make our eyes bright as we speak of them⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose hearts have a look southwards, and are open</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To the whole noon of nature⁠—these I have waked</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And wept o’er, night by night; oft pondering thus:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Homer is gone; and where is Jove? and where</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rival cities seven? His song outlives</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time, tower, and god⁠—all that then was save Heaven.</span>

								<span>Whether it be for our own good or ill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or others’ ill or good, it is for God’s</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Glory⁠—the same and always: it is ordered.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The soul is but an organ, and it hath</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No power of good and evil in itself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>More than the eye hath power of light or dark.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God fitted it for good; and evil is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Good, in another way we are not skilled in.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The good we do is of His own good will⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ill, of His own letting. Doth not nature⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All light in life, shine, marsh-like, too, in death?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yea, wandering fires wait even on rottenness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a stray gleam of thought in an idiot’s brain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And thus I look on souls that seem decaying</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In sin, and flying off by elements.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All may not live again; but all which do</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Must change perpetually e’en in Heaven;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And not by death to death, but life to life.</span>

								<span>We only know that God’s best purposes</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Have but one cause, and that the same⁠—God’s will,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Originally, ultimately Him.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All right is right divine. A worm hath rights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A king cannot despoil him of, nor sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet wrongs are things necessitate, like wants,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And oft are well permitted to best ends.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A double error sometimes sets us right.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In man there is no rule o£ right and wrong</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Inherent as mere man. Why, conscience is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The basest thing of all. Its life is passed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In justifying and condemning sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Accomplice, traitor, judge and headsman, too,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But conscience knows its business and performs.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nothing is lost in nature; and no soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though buried in the centre of all sin,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is lost to God; but there it works His will</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And burns comformably. The weakest things</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are to be made the examples of His might;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The most defective, of His perfect grace,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whene’er He thinketh well. Oh! everything</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To me seems good and lovely and immortal;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The whole is beautiful; and I can see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nought wrong in man nor nature, nought not meant;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As from His hands it comes who fashions all,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All holy as His word. The world is but</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A revelation. He breathes Himself upon us</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before our birth, as o’er the formless void</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He moveth at first, and we are all inspired</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With His spirit. All things are God or of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the whole world is in the mind of God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What a thought is in ours. Why boast we then</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of aught? All that is good belongs to God;</span>

								<span>Sole beam of Light, so the three Persons make</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One God; neither without the other is.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>However bright or beautiful itself</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The theme he touched, he made it more so by</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His own light, like a fire-fly on a flower.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And one of all I knew the most of, yet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The least can say of him; for full oft</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our thoughts drown speech, like to a foaming force,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which thunders down the echo it creates.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet must I somewhat tell of him. He was</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The spirit evil of the universe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Impersonate. Oh, strange and wild to know!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Perdition and destruction dwelt in him,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to a pair of eagles in one nest.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hollow and wasteful as a whirlwind was</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His soul; his heart as earthquake, and engulphed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>World upon world. In him they disappeared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As might a morsel in a lion’s maw,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world which met him rolled aside to let him</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pass on his piercing path. His eyeballs burned</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Revolving lightnings like a world on fire;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their very night was fatal as the shade</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Death’s dark valley. And his space-spread wings⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wide as the wings of Darkness when she rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Scowling, and backing upwards, as the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Giant of Light, first donned his burning crown,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gladdening all Heaven with bis inaugural smile⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were stained with the blood of many a starry world:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yea, I have seen him seize upon an orb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And cast it careless into worldless space,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As I might cast a pebble in the sea.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His might upon Ibis earth was wondrous most.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He stood a match for mountains. Ocean’s depths</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He clove unto their rock-bed, as a sword,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Through blood and muscle to the central bone,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With one swoop of his arm. His brow was pale⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pale as the life-blood of the undying worm</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which writhes around its frame of vital fire.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His voice blew like the desolating gust</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which strips the trees, and strews the earth with death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His words were ever like a wheel of fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rolling and burning this way now, now that:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now whirling forth a blinding beam, now soft</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And deep as Heaven’s own luminous blue⁠—and now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to a oonqueror’s chariot wheel they came,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sodden with blood and slow, revolving death:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And every tone fell on the ear and heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Heavy and harsh and startling, like the first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Handful of mould cast on the coffined dead,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though he claimed them his.</span>

								<span>Of those immortals, of a lofty air,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Him whom I spake of first she oft would stand</span>

								<br/>
								<span>She had but little pleasure; but her all,</span>

								<span>Such as it was, was in devising plans</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of bliss to come, or in the tales of Time</span>

								<span>The shadow of a cloud upon a lake,</span>

								<span>So sweetly sad and so consolingly,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When she spake even on the end of earth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save that her eye grew darker, and her brow</span>

								<span>’Twas on a lovely summer afternoon,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Close by the grassy marge of a deep tarn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nigh halfway up a mountain, that we stood,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I and the angel, when she told me this.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Above us rose the grey rocks, by our side</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forests of pines, and the bright breaking wavelets</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Came crowding, dancing to the brink, like thoughts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unto our lips. Before us shone the sun.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The angel waved her hand ere she began,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As bidding earth be still. The birds ceased singing</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the trees breathing, and the lake smoothed down</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each shining wrinkle and the wind drew off.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time leant him o’er his scythe and, listening, wept.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The circling world reined in her lightning pace</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A moment; Ocean hushed his snow-maned steeds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And a cloud hid the sun, as does the face</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A meditative hand: then spake she thus:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Scarce had the sweet song of the morning stars,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which rang through space at the first sign of life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our earth gave, springing from the lap of God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On to her orbit, when from Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Came down a white-winged host; and in the east,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where Eden’s Pleasance was, first furled their wings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Alighting like to snowflakes. There they built,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of the riches of the soil around,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A house to God. There were the ruby rocks,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And there, in blocks, the quarried diamonds lay;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Opal and emerald mountain, amethyst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sapphire and chrysoprase, and jacinth stood</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With the still action of a star, all light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like sea-based icebergs, blinding. These, with tools</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tempered in Heaven, the band angelic wrought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And raised, and fitted, having first laid down</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The deep foundations of the holy dome</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On bright and beaten gold; and all the while</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A song of glory hovered round the work</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like rainbow round a fountain. Day and night</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Went on the hallowed labor till ’twas done.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And yet but thrice the sun set, and but thrice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The moon arose; so quick is work divine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tower, and roof, and pinnacle, without,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Were solid diamond. Within, the dome</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was eyeblue sapphire, sown with gold-bright stars</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And clustering constellations; the wide floor</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All emerald, earthlike, veined with gold and silver,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Marble and mineral of every hue</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And marvellous quality, the meanest thing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where all things were magnificent, was gold⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The plainest. The high altar there was shaped</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of one ruby heartlike. Columned round</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With alabaster pure was all. And now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So high and bright it shone in the midday light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It could be seen from Heaven. Upon their thrones</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sun-eyed angels hailed it, and there rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A hurricane of blissfulness in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which echoed for a thousand years. One dark,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One solitary and foreseeing thought,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Passed, like a planet’s transit o’er the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Across the brow of God; but soon he smiled</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Towards earth, and that smile did consecrate</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The temple to Himself. And they who built</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bowed themselves down and worshipped in its walls.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>High on the front were writ these words⁠—to God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The heavenly built this for the earthly ones,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That in his worship both might mix on earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As afterward they hoped to do in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Had man stood good in £den this had been:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He fell and Eden vanished. The bright place</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Reared by the angels of all precious things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the joint worship of the sons of earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Heaven, fell with him, on the very day</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He should have met God and His angels there⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The very day he disobeyed and joined</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The host of death blackbannered, Eden fell;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The groves and grounds, which God the Lord’s own feet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Had hallowed; the all-hued and odorous bowers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where angels wandered, wishing them in Heaven;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The trees of life and knowledge⁠—trees of death</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And madness, as they proved to man⁠—all fell;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that bright fane fell first. No death-doomed eye</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gazed on its glory. Earthquakes gulped it down.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Temple of the Angels, vast enough</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To hold air nations worshipping at once,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lay in its grave; the cherubs’ flaming swords</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sole sad torches of its funeral.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till at the flood, when the world’s giant heart</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Burst like a shell, it scattered east and west,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And far and wide, among less noble ruins,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fragments of that angel-builded fane,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which was in Eden, and of which all stones</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That now are precious, were; and still shall be,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gathered again unto a happier end,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the pure City of the Son of God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And temple yet to be rebuilt in Zion;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which, though once overthrown, and once again</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Torn down to its foundations, in the quick</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of earth, shall soul-like yet re-rise from ruin⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>High, holy, happy, stainless as a star,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Imperishable as eternity.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>—The angel ended; and the winds, waves, clouds,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sun, the woods, and merry birds went on</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As theretofore, in brightness, strength and music.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One scarce could think that earth at all had fallen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To look upon her beauty. If the brand</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of sin were on her brow, it was surely hid</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In natural art from every eye but God’s.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All things seemed innocence and happiness.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I was all thanks. And look! the angel said,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Take these, and give to one thou lovest best:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mine own hands saved from them the shining ruin</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whereof I have late told thee; and she gave</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What now are greenly glowing on thine arms.</span>

								<span>The heart gets dizzy with its drunken dance,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the voluptuous vanities of life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Enchain, enchant, and cheat my soul no more.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My spirit is on edge. I can enjoy</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nought which has not the honied sting of sin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That soothing fret which makes the young untried,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Longing to be beforehand with their nature,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In dreams and loneness cry, they die to live;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That wanton whetting of the soul, which while</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It gives a finer, keener edge for pleasure,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wastes more and dulls the sooner. Rouse thee, heart;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bow of my life thou yet art full of spring!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My quiver still hath many purposes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet what is worth a thought of all things here?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How mean, how miserable every care!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How doubtful, too, the system of the mind!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then the ceaseless, changeless, hopeless round</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of weariness and heartlessness and woe</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And vice and vanity! Yet these make life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The life at least I witness if not feel.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No matter! we are immortal. How I wish</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I could love men! for amid all life’s quests</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There seems but worthy one⁠—to do men good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It matters not how long we live but how.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For as the parts of one manhood while here</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We live in every age: we think and feel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And feed upon the coming and the gone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As much as on the now time. Man is one:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And he hath one great heart. It is thus we feel,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With a gigantic throb athwart the sea,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each others’ rights and wrongs; thus are we men.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let us think less of men and more of God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sometimes the thought comes swiftening over us,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a small bird winging the still blue air;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then again, at other times, it rises</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Slow, like a cloud which scales the skies all breathless,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And just over head lets itself down on us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sometimes we feel the wish across the mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rush, like a rocket tearing up the sky,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That we should join with God and give the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The slip: but while we wish, the world turns round,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And peeps us in the face⁠—the wanton world;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We feel it gently pressing down our arm⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The arm we had raised to do for truth such wonders;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We feel it softly bearing on our side⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We feel it touch and thrill us through the body⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we are fools and there’s an end of us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis a fine thought that sometime end we must.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There sets the sun of suns! dies in all fire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like Asher’s death-great monarch. God of might!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We love and live on power. It is spirit’s end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mind must subdue. To conquer is its life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Why mad’st Thou not one spirit, like the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To king the world? And oh! might I have been</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That sun-mind, how I would have warmed the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To love and worship and bright life!</span>

								<span>In the billow’s joyous dash of death go down.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At last came love; not whence I sought nor thought it;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As on a ruined and bewildered wight</span>
								<br/>

								<span>And last in Threelihood, and midst in One:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Although less hard to shape the wide-winged wind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er the bright heights of air. He will forgive:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For we, this moment, and all living souls⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All matter, are as much within his presence,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And known through, like a glass film in the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As we can ever be. Through sundry worlds</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The mortal wends, returning, and relates</span>

								<span>Dreams are mind-clouds, high, and unshapen beauties,</span>

								<span>Hater of man, and, most of all, of God.</span>

								<span>Controlling the great evil; for it is mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which shall rule and be ruled, and not the body,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In the last age of human sway on earth;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ambition ruined by its own success;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Aims lost, power useless: love, pure love, the last</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of mortal things that nestles in the heart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is a love which acts to death, and through death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And may come white, and bright and pure, like paper,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From refuse, or from clearest things at first;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is beyond the accidents of life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For things we make no compt of, have in them</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The seeds of life, use, beauty, like the cores</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of apples that we fling away;⁠—nought now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is left but trust in God, who tries the heart</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And saves it, at the last, from its own ruin⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The parting spirit fluttering like a flag,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Half from its earthy staff. The death-change comes.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death is another life. We bow our heads</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At going out, we think, and enter straight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Another golden chamber of the king’s,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Larger than this we leave, and lovelier.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then in shadowy glimpses, disconnect,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The story, flower like, closes thus its leaves.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The will of God is all in all. He makes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Destroys, remakes, for His own pleasure, all.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>After inferior nature is subdued,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The evil is confined. All elements</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Conglobe themselves from chaos, purified.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rebegotten world is born again.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The body and the soul cease; spirit lives:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And gloriously falsified are all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Earth’s caverned prophecies of bodyhood.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Spirits rise up and rule and link with Heaven;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The soul state is searched into; dormant Death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Evil, and all the dark gods of the heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the idolatrous passions, ruined, chained,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And worshipless, are seen; and there, the Word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Heard and obeyed;⁠—next comes the truth divine,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Redintergrative; Evil’s last and worst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Endeavour, vanquished⁠—by Almighty good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The last scene shows the final doom of earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Soul’s judgment, and salvation of the youth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As was fore-fixed on from and in the first:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The universe expurgated of evil,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hell for aye abolished; all create,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Redeemed, their God all love, themselves all bliss.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We may say that the sun is dead and gone</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ever; and may swear he will rise no more;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The skies may put on mourning for their God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And earth heap ashes on her head: but who</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall keep the sun back, when he thinks to rise?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where is the chain shall bind him? Where the cell</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall hold him? Hell, he would burn down to embers;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And would lift up the world with a lever of light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of his way: yet, know ye, ’twere thrice less</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To do thrice this, than keep the soul from God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er earth, and cloud, and sky, and star, and Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It dwells with God uprisen as a prayer.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The spirit speaks of God in Heaven’s own tongue,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No mystery to those who love, but learned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As is our mother tongue, om Him, the parent;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>By whom created, fashioned, flesh and spirit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All forms and feelings of all kinds of beauty</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are burned into our heart-clay, pattern like.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Much too is writ, elsewhere and here, not yet,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Made clear, nor can be till earth come of age;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the unfinished rudiments of light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which gather time by time into a star.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus have I shown the meaning of the book,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the most truthful likeness of a mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which hath as yet been limned; the mind of youth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In strengths and failings, in its overcomings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in its short comings; the kingly ends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The universalizing heart of youth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its love of power, heed not how had, although</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With surety of self-ruin at the end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Every thing urged against it proves its truth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And faithfulness to nature. Some cried out</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twas inconsistent; so ’twas meant to be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such is the very stamp of youth and nature;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the continual losing sight of its aims,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the desertion of its most expressed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And dearest rules and objects, this is youth.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>And the world was: and then go on to show</span>

								<span>How this new orb was made, and where it shone;</span>

								<span>Wise, holy, beautiful; if not to be</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Father-like, blessing all and cursing none;</span>

								<span>After us all are critics, to a man.</span>

								<span>I dreamed once that the night came down to me;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In figure, oh! too like thine own for truth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And looked into me with his thousand eyes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that made me unhappy; but it passed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And I half wished it back. Mind hath its earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Heaven. The many petty common thoughts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On which we daily tread, as it were, make one,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And above which few look; the other is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That high and welkin-like infinity⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The brighter, upper half of the mind’s world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thick with great sun-like and constellate thoughts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in the night of mind, which is our sleep,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>These thoughts shine out in dreams. Dreams double life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They are the heart’s bright shadow on life’s flood;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And even the step from death to deathlessness⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From this earth’s gross existence unto Heaven⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can scarce be more than from the harsh hot day</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To sleep’s soft scenes, the moonlight of the mind.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The wave is never weary of the wind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But in mountainous playfulness leaps to it</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Always; but mind gets weary of the world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And glooms itself in sleep, like a sweet smile,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Line by line, settling into proper sadness;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For sleep seems part of our immortality:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And why should any thing that dies be sad?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Last night I dreamed I walked within a hall⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The inside of the world. Long shroud-like lights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lit up its lift-like dome and pale wide walls,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Horizon-like; and every one was there:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was the house of Death, and Death was there.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We could not see him, but he was a feeling:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We knew he was around us⁠—heard us⁠—eyed us;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But where wast thou? I never met thee once.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all was still as nothing; or as God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deep judging, when the thought of making first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quickened and stirred within Him; and He made</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All Heaven at one thought as at a glance.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Noise was there none; and yet there was a sound</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which seemed to be half like silence, half like sound.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All crept about still as the cold wet worms,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which slid among our feet, we could not scape from.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bound me were ruined fragments of dead gods⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Those shadows of the mystery of One⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the red worms, too, flourished over these,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For marble is a shadow weighed with mind;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Each being, as men of old believed, distinct</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In form, and place, and power. But Oh! not all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The gathered gods of Eld could shine like ours,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No more than all yon stars could make a sun.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But truly then men lived in moral night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Neath a dim starlight of religious truth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I felt my spirit’s spring gush out more clear,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Gazing on these: they beautified my mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As rocks and flowers reflected do a well.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mind makes itself like that it lives amidst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And on; and thus, among dreams, imaginings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And scenes of awe, and purity, and power,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Grows sternly sweet and calm⁠—all beautiful</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With god-like coldness and unconsciousness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of mortal passion, mental toil; until,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to the marble model of a god,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It doth assume a firm and dazzling form,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Scarcely less incorruptible than that</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It emblems: and so grew, methought, my mind.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Matter hath many qualities; mind, one:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is irresistible: pure power⁠—pure god.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While wandering on I met what seemed myself:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Was it not strange that we should meet, and there?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But all is strange in dreaming, as in death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And waking, as in life: nought is not strange.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Methought that I was happy, because dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All hurried to and fro; and many cried</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To each other⁠—Can I do thee any good?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But no one heeded: nothing could avail:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world was one great grave. I looked, and saw</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time on his two great wings⁠—one, night⁠—one, day⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fly, moth-like, right into the flickering sun;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So that the sun went out, and they both perished.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And one gat up and spake⁠—a holy man⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Exhorting them; but each and all cried out⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Go to!⁠—it helps not⁠—means not: we are dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death spake no word methought, but me he made</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Speak for him; and I dreamed that I was Death;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then, that Death only lived: all things were mixed;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Up and down shooting, like the brain’s fierce dance</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a delirium, when we are apt to die.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hell is my heir; what kin to me is Heaven?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bring out your hearts before me. Give your limbs</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To whom ye list or love. My son, Decay,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will take them: give them him. I want your hearts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That I may take them up to God. There came</span>
								<br/>
								<span>These words among us, but we knew not whence;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was as if the air spake. And there rose</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of the earth a giant thing, all earth;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His eye was earthy, and his arm was earthy:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He had no heart. He but said, I am Decay;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, as he spake, he crumbled into earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the was nothing of him. But we all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lifted our faces up at the word, God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And spied a dark star high above in the midst</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of others, numberless as are the dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all plucked out their hearts, and held them in</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their right hands. Many tried to pick out specks</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And stains, but could not: each gave up his heart.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And something⁠—all things⁠—nothing⁠—it was Death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Said, as before, from air⁠—Let us to God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And straight we rose, leaving behind the raw</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Worms and dead gods, all of us⁠—soared and soared</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Right upwards, till the star I told thee of</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Looked like a moon⁠—the moon became a sun:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The sun⁠—there came a hand between the sun and us,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And its five fingers made five nights in air.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God tore the glory from the sun’s broad brow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And flung the flaming scalp off flat to Hell.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I saw Him do it; and it passed close by us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then I heard a long, cold, skeleton scream,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a trumpet whining through a catacomb,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which made the sides of that great grave shake in.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I saw the world and vision of the dead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dim itself off⁠—and all was life! I woke,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And felt the high sun blazoning on my brow</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His own almighty mockery of woe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fierce and infinite laugh at things which cease.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hell hath its light⁠—and Heaven; he burns with both.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And my dream broke, like life from the last limb⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Quivering; so loth I felt to let it go,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Just as I thought I had caught sight of Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It came to nought, as dreams of Heaven on earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Do always.</span>

								<span>The world had wound a perishing garb around it;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While yet its God came down and spake to it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such and so great are dreams. My might, my being</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To him is but a dream’s. And could a state</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To come fill up their dream-stretched minds, they might</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be gods. And may it not be so? Then man</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is worth my ruining. What does he dream?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With all the sway his spirit now exerts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er time, space, thought it is but a shadowy sway,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Light as a mountain shadow on a lake.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mine is the mountain’s self. A touch would shake</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To nought whatever his soul now feels or acts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But not a world-quake could touch aught of mine:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus much we differ. I will not envy man.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Power alone makes being bearable.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And yet this dream-power is mind-power⁠—real:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All things are real: fiction cannot be.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A thought is real as the world⁠—a dream</span>
								<br/>
								<span>True as all God doth know⁠—with whom all is true.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The deep dense sleep of half-dead exhaustedness!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Would I could feel it. Ah! he wakes at last.</span>

								<span>As once she was above thee, thou of the world-belt!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And she who had thee, and who knew thee god,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Died of her boast, and lies in her own dust.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And she who loved thee, the young blushy Morning,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who caught thee in her arms, and bore thee off</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Far o’er the lashing seas to a lonely isle,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where she might pleasure longer and in secret⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That love undid thee; and it is so now:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whether the beauty seek, or flee, or have,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis a like ill⁠—this beauty doubly mortal.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What though the moon with madness slew thee there,</span>

								<span>Let me believe it was within the arms</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That loved thee even in the stroke of death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that there snapped the lightning link of life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Kill, but not conquer, man nor mind may gods.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou image of the Almighty error, man!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Banished and banned to Heaven, by a weak world,</span>

								<span>Which makes the minds it cannot master gods</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And thou, the first and greatest of half-gods,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which they in olden time did star together</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To an idolatrous immortality;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who nationalized the Heavens, and gave all stars</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unto the spirits of the good and brave,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forestalling God by ages⁠—wondrous men!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And if⁠—beguiled by wine, and the low wiles</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Like to high noon in the midst of all his might,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Close by the brink of immortality⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The deep dominions of thy sea-sire, thou</span>

								<span>Didst lose thy light by kings who hate the great,</span>

								<span>A sound, then, first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I heard as of a pent-up flood just burst:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It was the rush of God’s world-winnowing wing;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which bowed the orbs as flowers are bowed by breath of spring.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And then a voice I heard, a voice sublime⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To which the hoarded thunders of all time</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pealing earth’s death-knell shall a whisper be⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Saying these words⁠—Where will ye worship me?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ay, where shall be your Maker’s holy place?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Heaven of Heavens is poor before His face.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How shall ye mete my temple, ye who die?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Look! can ye span your God’s infinity?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hear, mighty universe, thy Maker’s voice!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let all thy myriad, myriad worlds rejoice!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lo! I, your Maker, do amid ye come,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To choose my worship and to name my home.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This heard each sphere; and all throughout the sky</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Came crowding round. Our earth was rolling by,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When God said to it⁠—Rest! and fast it stood.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With voice like winds through some wide olden wood,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus spake the One again: Behold, O Earth!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy parent, God! it is I who gave thee birth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With all my love I did thee once endow;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With all my mercy⁠—and thou hast them now.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But hear my words! thou never lovedst me well,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor fearedst my wrath: dreadst thou no longer Hell?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dream’st thou that guilt shall always mock those fires?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That deathless death which Hell for aye expires?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Should all creation its rebellion raise,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I speak, and this broad universe doth blaze⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pass like a dew-drop ’neath mine angry rays⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Blaze like the fat in sacrificial flame:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that burned offering, when I come to claim,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its scorching, quenchless mass, all, I will pour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Upon thy naked soul:⁠—canst thou endure?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He spake; and, as the fear-fraught words flew past,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Earth fluttered like a dead leaf in their blast.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Am not I God? Answer me! Hope not thou,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Impenitent, to ward my righteous blow.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet, come again! my proffered mercy hear!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rejoice and sing! sweet music in thine ear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And peace I speak: seek but to be forgiven:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Repent! and thou shalt meet thy God in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Go! cleanse thy brow from blood, thy heart from crime,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And on thy Saviour call while yet is time!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now to this universe of pride and sin</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I speak, ere yet I call mine angels in.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Draw nigh, ye worlds!⁠—and, lo! their light did seem</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before His eye paled to a pearl’s dull beam.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Attend! said God⁠—o’er all He lift his hand.⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where will ye set my tent? where shall my temple stand?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all were dumb. Distracting silence spread</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Throughout that host as each were stricken dead.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I made ye. I endowed ye. Ye are mine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then trembled out each orb: Thine, God! for ever Thine!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All that ye have, within myself have I;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God, am complete; full inexhaustibly.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I dwell within myself, and ye in me,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not in yourselves; I have infinity.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The everything in all things is my throne;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your might is my might, and your wealth mine own:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Tis by my power and sufferance that ye shine:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I live in light and all your light is mine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be dark! said God. Night was. Each glowing sphere</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dulled, Night seemed everything and everywhere,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Save that in utter space a feeble flare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Told that the pits of hell were sunken there.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shuddered in fear the universe the while,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till God again embraced it with a smile.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all things made were glad. Come now and hear,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye worlds! said God, the truth I thus make clear:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My words are mercy, wherefore should ye fear?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And straight, obedient to his sacred will,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One great concentrate globe they crowd to fill;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Systems and suns pour forth their glowing urns;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Full in the face of God the glory burns.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hearken, thou host! thy trembling hope to raise,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I to all Being thus make plain my ways;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God, the creator, bade creation rise,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And matter came in void like clouds in skies;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lifeless and cold it spread throughout all space,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And darkness dwelt and frowned upon its face:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Chaos I bade depart this work of mine,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And straight the mighty elements disjoin.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then light I lit; then order I ordained,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And put the dance of atoms to an end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Matter I brake, and scattered into globes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And clad ye each in green and growing robes:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your sizes, places, forms, I fixed with laws,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And wrought the link between effect and cause.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then formed I lives for each, which might inherit</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will, reason, form, and power⁠—not deathless spirit.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then I made spirits, things of Heavenly worth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Deathless, Divine. Round these, from every earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I gathered forms and features fit for love,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Trust, pleasure, power, and all I could approve.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To every spirit I disclosed my name,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My love, my might, and whence all Being came:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To deathless souls I righteously decreed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Accountability for thought, word, deed.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then every orb complete, along the sky,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In glory, beauty, order, harmony,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I launched. Souls, worlds did every thing possess</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which could a mortal and immortal bless.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To all the hope of happier state was given⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For all I keep one common boundless Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye all have freedom, and ye all do sin,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ye are creatures: but ye all may win</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Life everlasting⁠—everlasting joy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If ye do but the love of sin destroy:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>This only is offence; for sin ye must</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not by my will; but weakness dwells with dust,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unless ye have sinned ye cannot enter Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How shall a sinless creature be forgiven?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And by forgiveness only can ye claim</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hope in my mercy, trust upon my name.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I knew that ye would all to sin be given;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But I, even God, have paid your price to Heaven:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And if ye will not journey on that way⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The truth⁠—the life⁠—what do ye merit? say!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death is the gate of life, and sin, of bliss:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mark the dread truth! but mourn your deeds amiss.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cast off your guilt! abandon folly’s path!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Turn to the Lord your God ere hell His wrath!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Turn from your madness, wicked ones, and live!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Take, take the bliss which God alone can give.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God, the Creator, me all beings own⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God, the Redeemer, I will still be known⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God, too, the Judge⁠—the each⁠—the three⁠—the one.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Again the Everlasting cried⁠—Repent!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To bless or curse I am Omnipotent.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And what art thou, created Being? Round</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That world of worlds His arm the Almighty wound;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bright immensity He raised, and pressed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All trembling, like a babe, unto His breast.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There, in the Father’s bosom rose again,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of filial love, the universal strain;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Strong and exultant⁠—blissful, pure, sublime,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It rolled, and thrilled, and swelled in notes unknown to time.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Think ye that I, who thus do ye maintain;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus always cherish ye, or all were vain⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye all would drop into your native void,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If by my hand ye were not held and buoyed:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Think ye that I cannot uphold in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In righteous state, the souls I have forgiven?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is this a weightier task? with God, ’tis one</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To guide a sunbeam or create a sun⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To rule ten thousand thousand worlds or none.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Go, worlds! said God, but learn, ere ye depart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My favoured temple is an humble heart;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therein to dwell I leave my loftiest skies⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There shall my holy of all holies rise!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He spake; and swiftly, reverent to His will,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sprang each bright orb on high its sphere to fill.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Glory to God! they chanted as they soared⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Father Almighty! be Thou all-adored.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thou art the glory⁠—we, Thine universe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Serve but abroad Thy lustre to disperse.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unsearchable, and yet to all made known!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world at once Thy kingdom and Thy throne⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pity us, God! nor chase us quite away</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before Thy wrath, as night before the day.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In Thee, our God, we live; from Thee we came⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The feeble sparks of Thine eternal flame.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy breath from nothing filled us all at first,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And could again as soon the bubble burst.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In Thee, like motes in the sunbeam, we move;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Glow in Thy light, and gladden in Thy love.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And midst this praise, earth was the only one</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sullen remained in that grand union</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of joy and harmony. Word spake she none.</span>

								<span>Soul of the world, divine Necessity,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Servant of God, and master of all things!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Here, in the Heaven of light’s eternal noon,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>First see I all things clear: from end to end</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The divine cycle of the soul of man;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How spirit, soul, mind, life, flesh, feeling, mix,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And how, withal they each reciprocate,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As ocean, earth, air, fire and wind; how flow</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The streams of feeling, and the cataracts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of passion; mine and mountain, this of pride,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that of covetousness. Man I know;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The human universe and the divine</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And central fate; know all must be fufilled</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of nature that there is; of sin and strife,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Peace, righteousness, change, self-delusion, self⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Destruction, ere the earth can take new life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or man become the minister of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world and man are just reciprocal,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet contrary. Spirit invadeth sense</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And carries captive Nature. Be this true,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All good is Heaven, and all ill is Hell.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All things are means for greater good. Thou, Sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Art just a giant-slave, a god in bonds.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The summit-flower of all created life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is its unition with Divinity,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In essence, yet existence separate.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>High o’er my own existence, here then I</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Look down upon the nature and the earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet mine, whose separate and combined ends</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have still to be evolved. How wide men miss,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While in the lower world of soul and sense,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In aiming even at life-ruling Truth⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Formless as air, simple and one as Death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If Heaven and all its stars depend on earth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then may eternity on time;⁠—not else.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But since now earth is as a crumb of Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And time an atom of eternity,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Neither depends upon the other, both</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One essence being emanant from God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose flowings forth are aye and infinite,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And radiant as the rivers of the skies.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One only truth hath consequence, God’s truth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Inspirited in man. Mere human truth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or falsehood matters not. The world may act,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Believe, or bless, or curse, as best it lists.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet men expend life, solemnizing points</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Uncertain as the site of Paradise</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And area of Hades. Not the less,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is no disappointment we endure</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One half so great as that we are to ourselves.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We make our hearts the centres of all hopes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All powers, all rewards, remembering not</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That centres are imaginary points.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Imaginary circles only too</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Are perfect; therefore, draw life as we may,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bound as a world, or as an atom round,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And pure as virgin visionary’s dream,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or perfect faith’s regenerative wave⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It fails to match the true invisible</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whereof we labor. It is come to this.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One state of life with me hath passed away.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Aught henceforth that may matter be of doubt</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To me is matter of indifference. I</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Love only that is certain. Me no more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The spirits of the bright invisible</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall throng round as the winds some mountain-top;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor watery lightfulness of ghostly eyes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Belonging heavenly forms informed with light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Impose their spell of record under pain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The inspiration quits me⁠—it is gone⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like a retreating army from the land</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which it hath wasted⁠—the long gleaming mass,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Snakelike, at last hath wound itself away,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And left me weak and wretched. None again</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of all the starry tribes of shining mien⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Swifter than undulations of the light,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A million in a moment, multiform</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As atomies of air, shall visit me;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their word of leave is taken back⁠—henceforth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Restricted to perfection, earth they quit.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>True, albeit, I loved them more than life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I felt myself made sacred by their touch:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But they are gone, and there is nought on earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Left acceptable. Fiery shadows, hence!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I have outbraved ye once. It matters not.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I have left all for one; Truth’s countless rays</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For Truth itself; the mean for the supreme,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The dubitable for the throned power.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet thus I cannot rest. The mightiest sphere</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is not for man. The elements of mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And matter are proportioned in all worlds;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The father they and mother of all things.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And earth hath favour over crowds of stars.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I must reseek earth. Still what boots it now,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To plunge in pleasure or to passion bow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The very lion-honey of the heart</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which dwelleth in corruption? Yet, perchance,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twere wisdom to extract it while we may.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The oak, as lily, feels the lightest breeze.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ineradicable seed is sown</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of love in life, and tide-like ’twill have way</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er the impalaced prisoner of the breast.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The thirst for power and knowledge still exist,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And meet with dizzy mixture in the brain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If suffering could expiate offence,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They who have most enjoyed have most atoned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It may be, humanly;⁠—but it cannot.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Earth-like, the heart must undergo all change</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ere the superior life be formed therein,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The chastity of heart which loves but God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Life’s sensuous warmth, the spirit’s holy chill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time’s week-day work, have yet to be gone through.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The hortus siccus of a Paradise</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is all earth now can boast. To God belongs</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The autumn of all nature. But, alas!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not yet can we o’ercome our nature here,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Would we. If therefore passion strike the heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let it have length of line and plenteous play.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The safety of superior principles</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lies in exhaustion of the lower ones,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>However vast or violent. Men and angels</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Obey the order of existence. Fate!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who seeks thee everywhere, will find thee there.</span>

									<span>Ah! these poor arms are far from where they should be;</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Why art thou thus so long away from me?</span>

									<span>And I who loved it then can love it now;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But am not what I was, in one degree.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Calm star! who was it named thee Lucifer,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From him who drew the third of Heaven down with him?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Oh! it was but the tradition of thy beauty!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For if the sun hath one part, and the moon one,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou hast the third part of the host of Heaven⁠—</span>

								<br/>
								<span>A friend with whom, in boyhood, I was wont</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To learn, think, laugh, weep, strive, and love, together;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For we were alway rivals in all things⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Together up high springy hills, to trace</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A runnel to its birthplace⁠—to pursue</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A river⁠—to search, haunt old ruined towers,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And muse in them⁠—to scale the cloud-clad hills</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While thunders murmured in our very ear;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To leap the lair of the live cataract,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And pray its foaming pardon for the insult;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To dare the broken tree-bridge across the stream;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To crouch behind the broad white waterfall,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tongue of the glen, like to a hidden thought⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dazzled, and deafened, yet the more delighted;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To reach the rock which makes the fall and pool;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There to fee safe, or not to care if not;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To fling the free loot over my native hills,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which seemed to breathe the bracing breeze we loved</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The more it lifted up our loosened locks,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That nought might be between us and the skies;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or, hand in hand, leap, laughing, with closed eyes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In Trent’s death-loving deeps; yet was she kind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ever to us; and bare us buoyant up,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And followed our young strokes, and cheered us on⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Even as an elder sister bending above</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A child, to teach it how to order its feet⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As quick we dashed, in reckless rivalry,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To reach, perchance, some long green floating flag⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Just when the sun’s hot lip first touched the stream,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Reddening to be so kissed; and we rejoiced,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As breasting it on we went over depth and death,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Strong in the naked strife of elements,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Toying with danger in as little fear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As with a maiden’s ringlets. And oft, at night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bewildered and bewitched by favorite stars,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We would breathe ourselves amid unfooted snows,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For there is poetry where aught is pure;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or over the still dark heath, leap along, like harts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Through the broad moonlight; for we felt where’er</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We leapt the golden gorse, or lowly ling,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We could not be from home.⁠—That friend is gone.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There’s the whole universe before our souls.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where shall we meet next? Shall we meet again?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! might it be in some far happy world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That I might light upon his lonely soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hard by some broad blue stream, where high the hills,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wood-bearded, sweep to its brink⁠—musing, as wont,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With love-like sadness, upon sacred things;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For much in youth we loved and mused on them.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To say what ought to be to human wills,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And measure mortals sternly; to explore</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bearings of men’s duties and desires;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To note the nature and the laws of mind;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To balance good with evil; and compare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The nature and necessity of each;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To long to see the ends and end of things;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or, if no end there be, the endless, then,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As suns look into space; these were our joys⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our hopes⁠—our meditations⁠—our attempts.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, if I have enjoyed more love than others,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is but superior suffering, and is more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Than balanced by the loss of one we love.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And love, itself, hath passed. One fond fair girl</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Remains; one only, and she loves me still.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But it is not love I feel: it is pore kindness.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How shall I find another like my last?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The golden and the gorgeous loveliness⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A sunset beauty! Ah! I saw it set.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My heart, alas! set with it. I have drained</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Life of all love, as doth an iron rod</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The Heaven’s of lightning; I have done with it,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all its waking woes, and dreamed-of joys.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No more shall beauty star the air I live in;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And no more will I wake at dead of night,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And hearken to the roaring of the wind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though it came to carry one away⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Claiming for sin. Ah! I am lost forever.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To earn the world’s delights by equal sins.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Seems the great aim of life⁠—the aim succeeds.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Here it is madness, and perdition there.</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>The soul in looking upon natural beauty.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! earth, like man her son, is half divine.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is not a leaf within this quiet spot,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But which I seem to know; should miss, if gone.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I could run over its features, hour by hour.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The quaintly figured beds⁠—the various flowers⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The mazy paths all cunningly converged⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The black yew hedge, like a beleaguering host,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Round some fair garden province⁠—here and there,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The cloud-like laurel clumps sleep, soft and fast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pillowed by their own shadows⁠—and beyond,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ripe and ruddy fruitage⁠—the sharp firs’</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fringe, like an eyelash, on the faint-blue west⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The white owl, wheeling from the grey old church⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its age-peeled pinnacles; and tufted top⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The oaks, which spread their broad arms in the blast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bid storms come, and welcome; there they stand,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To whom a summer passes like a smile:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the proud peacock towers himself there and screams,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ruffling the imperial purples of his neck.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’er all, the giant poplars, which maintain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Equality with clouds half way up Heaven;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which whisper with the winds none else can see,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And how to angels as they wing by them;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The lonely, bowery, woodland view before⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, making all more beautiful, thou, sweet moon,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leading slow pomp, as triumphing o’er Heaven!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>High riding in thy loveless, deathless brightness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in thy cold, unconquerable beauty,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though there were nothing worthy in the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Even to lie below thee, face to God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Night, in her own name, and God’s again,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath dipped the earth in dew;⁠—and there she lies,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Even like a heart all trembling with delight,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till passion murder power to speak⁠—so mute.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Young maiden moon! just looming into light⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I would that aspect never might be changed;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor that fine form, so spirit-like, be spoiled</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With fuller light. Oh! keep that brilliant shape;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Keep the delicious honor of thy youth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sweet sister of the sun, more beauteous thou</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Than he sublime. Shine on, nor dread decay.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It may take meaner things; but thy bright look,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Smiling away an immortality,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Assures it us⁠—nay, it seems, half, to give.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Earth may decease. God will not part with thee,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fair ark of light, and every blessedness!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yes, earth, this earth, may foul the face of life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like some swart mole on beauty’s breast⁠—or dead,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stiff, mangled reptile, some clear well⁠—while thou</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shalt shine, aye brilliant, on creation’s corse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like to a diamond on a dead man’s hand;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whence God shall pluck thee to His breast, or bid</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beam ’mid His lightning locks. What are earth’s joys</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To watching thee, tending thy bright flock over</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fields of Heaven? Thy light misleadeth not,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Though eyes which image Heaven oft lure to Hell;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy smile betrayeth not⁠—though sweet as that</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which wins and damns. Mother, and maid of light!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That, like a God, redeems the world to Heaven⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Making us one with thee, and with the sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And with the stars in glory⁠—lovely moon!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I am immortal as thyself; and we</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall look upon each other yet, in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Often⁠—but never, never more on earth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Am I to die so soon? This death⁠—the thought</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Comes oh my heart as through a burning glass.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I cannot bend mine eyes to earth, but thence</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It riseth, spectre-like, to mock⁠—nor towards</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The west, where sunset is, whose long bright pomp</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Makes men in love with change⁠—but there it lowers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Eve’s last, still lingering, darkening, cloud; and on</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The escutcheon of the morn, it is there⁠—it is there!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But fears will come upon the bravest mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like the white moon upon the crimson west.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I have attractions for all miseries:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And every course of thought, within my heart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leaves a new layer of woe. But it must end.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It will all be one, hereafter. Let it be!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My bosom, like the grave, holds all quenched passions.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is not that I have not found what I sought⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But, that the world⁠—tush! I shall see it die.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I hate, and shall outlive the hypocrite.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stealthily, slowly, like the polar sun,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who peeps by fits above the air-walled world⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The heavenly fief, he knows and feels his own,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My heart o’erlooks the Paradise of life</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which it hath lost, in cold, reluctant joy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I live and see all beauteous things about me,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But feel no nature prompting from within</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To meet and profit by them. I am like</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That fabled forest of the Apennine,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which leafless lives; whereto the spring’s bright showers,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Summer’s heat breathless, autumn’s fruitful juice,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nothing avail;⁠—nor winter’s killing cold.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet have I done, said, thought, in time now past,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What, rather than remember, I would die,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or do again. It is the thinking on’t,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the repentance, maddens. I have thought</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Upon such things so long and grievously,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My lip have grown like to a cliff-chafed sea,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pale with a tidal passion; and my soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Once high and bright and self-sustained as Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unsettled now for life or death, feels like</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The grey gull balanced on her bowlike wings,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Between two black waves seeking where to dive.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Long we live, thinking nothing of our fate,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For in the morn of life we mark it not⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It falls behind; but as our day goes down</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We catch it lengthening with a giant’s stride,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And ushering us unto the feet of night.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dark thoughts, like spots upon the sun, revolve</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In troops fox days together round my soul,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Disfiguring and dimming. Death! oh death!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The past, the present, and the future, like</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The dog three-headed, by the gates of woe</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sitting, seem ready to devour me each.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I dare not look on them. I dare not think.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The very best deeds I have ever done</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Seem worthy reprobation, have to be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Repented of. But have I done aught good?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh that my soul were calmer! Grant me, God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy peace; that added, I can smile and die.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy Spirit only is reality:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All things beside are folly, falsehood, shame.</span>

									<span>I feel as if I could devour the days</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Till the time came when I shall gain mine end;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>God shall have made me ruler, and all worlds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Signed the sublime recognizance. Till then⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even as a boat lies rocking on the beach,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Waiting the one white wave to float it free,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wait I the great event;⁠—too great it seems.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet, Lord, thou knowest that the power I seek</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is but for others’ good and Thine own glory,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the desire for it inspired by Thee.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So use me as I use it. Thou hast passed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy word that such I shall enjoy, and then</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My mission is accomplished in this world.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I go unto another, where all souls</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Begin again, or take, up life from where</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Death broke it at. I cannot think there will be</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like disproportion there between our powers</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And will, as here; if not, I shall be happy.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I feel no bounds. I cannot think but thought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>On thought springs up, illimitably, round,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As a great forest sows itself; but here</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There is nor ground nor light enough to live.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could I, I would be every where at once,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like the sea, for I feel as if I could</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Spread out my spirit o’er the endless world,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And act at all points:⁠—I am bound to one.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I must be here, and there, and everywhere,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or I am nowhere. Sense, flesh, fueling, fail</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before the feet of the imperious mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To which they are but as the dust she treads⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Windlike treads o’er, uplifts and leaves behind.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>How mind will act with body glorified</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And spiritualized, and senses fined,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pointed brilliantwise, we know not. Here</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even, it may be wrong in us to deem</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The senses degradations, otherwise</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than as fine steps, whereby the Queenly soul</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Comes down from her bright throne to view the mass</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She hath dominion over, and the things</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of her inheritance; and reascends,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With an indignant fiery purity,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not to be touched, her seat. The visible world,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whereby God maketh Nature known to us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is not derogatory to Himself</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As the pure Spirit Infinite. A world</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Is but, perhaps, a sense of God’s, by which</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He may explain His nature, and receive</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fit pleasure. But the hour is hard at hand,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When Time’s grey wing shall winnow all away,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The atoms of the earth, the stars of Heaven;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the created and Creator mind</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Shall know each other, worlds and bodies both</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Put off for aye; man and his Maker meet</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Where all, who through the universe do well,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Embrace their heart’s desire; what things they will,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And whom remember; live, too, where they list;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with the beings they love best, and God,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Inherit and inhabit boundless bliss.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hear me, all-favouring God! my latest prayer;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou unto whom all nations of the world</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lift up their hearts, like grass-blades to the sun;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou who hast all things and hast need of nought;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thou who hast given me Earth and all it holds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Give me, from out Thy garner stored with good,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Some sign, Lord! while I live, in proof to earth</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My prayers are with Thee; that they rend the clouds,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, rising through the sightless dark of space,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Reach to Thy central throne. Oh! let me feel,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What was my constant dream in my young years,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And is in all my better moments now⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My hope, my faith, my nature’s sum and end,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Oneness with Thee and Heaven. Lord! make me sure</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My soul already is in unison</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With the triumphant. Ah! I surely hear</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The voices of the spirits of the saints,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And witnesses to the Redeeming Truth;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not, as of old, in scanty scattered strains,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Breathed from the caves of earth and cells of cities⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor as the voice of martyr choked with fire⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But in one solemn Heaven-pervading hymn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of happiness impregnable, as when</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From the bright walls of the Son’s city they</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Looked on the war of Hell, host upon host,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Foiled by God’s single sword before their gates</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of perfect pearl;⁠—nearer and nearer now!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This is the sign, O God! which Thou hast given,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And I will praise Thee through Eternity.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Her life, to freshen this parched heart. It was thus:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I said we were to part, but she said nothing.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There was no discord⁠—it was music ceased⁠—</span>

								<span>Life’s thrilling, bounding, bursting joy. She sat</span>

								<span>As if her eye were action, speech and feeling.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I felt it all; and came and knelt beside her.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The electric touch solved both our souls together.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then comes the feeling which unmakes, undoes;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which tears the sealike soul up by the roots</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And lashes it in scorn against the skies.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Twice did I madly swear to God, hand clenched,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That not even He nor death should tear her from me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is the saddest and the sorest sight</span>

								<span>One’s own love weeping;⁠—but why call on God,</span>

								<span>But that the feeling of the boundless bounds</span>

								<br/>
								<span>But let me, at your will, ye peaceful saints,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Relate what happed to us from first to last.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The time was come in Heaven when God the Son,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bowing his head before the Omnipotent,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who doubled every blessing infinite</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherewith he had enriched His Only One</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From first, rose from his glorious throne, and stepped</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into His sun-bright car, calling aloud</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His angels to attend Him while He went</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To judge the earth, as fore-ordained of old:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That Heaven and earth might view the majesty</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And mercy of the God of all. We came,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Selectest spirits, countless⁠—crowded bright</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As the great stream of stars which flows through Heaven</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fast by the foot of God, each wave a world⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Eager to the eye this act of glory long</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Talked of in Heaven, and now to be achieved.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Forth from the starry towers, and world-wide walls,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Heaven, we set in high and silent joy,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And journeyed half our way through Heaven, when lo!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A sight which checked the foremost flaming ranks,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That halted frontwise, working doubt at first,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But triumph after. Shielded and drawn up close,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Behind a broken and decaying world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From which the light had vanished like the light</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Out of a death-shrunk eye, sat Lucifer⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Midst in the powers of darkness, and the hosts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of hell, enthroned sublime; and all were still</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As ambushed silence round the Foe of God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But oh! how changed from him we knew in Heaven,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose brightness nothing made might match nor mar;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who rose, and it was morn;⁠—who stretched his wing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And stepped from star to star;⁠—so changed he showed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Most like a shadowy meteor, thorough which</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The stars dim glint⁠—woe-wasted, pined with pain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And by his side there sat or shrank a shape</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We angels knew not, but the Son of God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Knew him, and called him Death; whom, when he saw,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Arousing, after, out of sleep intense,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That unrealmed tyrant drew his mortal dart,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And drave it through himself⁠—a shade, shade-quelled.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then to that chief of mischief and his fiends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who, thick as burning stones that from the throat</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of some volcano foul the benighted sky,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shot up triumphant into air as they</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beheld our ranks move on, thus spake our Lord⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not wrathfully, but sternly pitying:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hell’s wretched remnant! wherefore crouch ye here?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is it to sue destruction, or to bar</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My passage? If it be, in both ye err.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And will ye trust yourselves again to war</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With me Almighty? Have I not overcome</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye separately, both? Speak, brutal Death!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fit follower and fellow to all woes⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherefore this instantaneous haste from hell,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And both from Hadeän bondage, thus again</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So soon to compass mightiest wickedness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And tempt extremest wrath? Speak, head of hell!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To Him thus Lucifer: Almighty Son!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thy power I defy not; but in peace</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I war with fate. My life is to destroy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Evil hath more activity, if good</span>
								<br/>
								<span>More strength: and one must wear the other out.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The more august the sin, so much the more</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is my necessity. Yon earth hath been</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The battle-plain of Heaven and hell. From Thee,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who knowest all things, it were vain to hide</span>
								<br/>
								<span>My purpose, which for a thousand years, the years</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of bondage, hath grown in me and lived on,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Toad-like within a rock⁠—vital where all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beside was death⁠—to seize the nascent souls</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of men a they rerose from death to life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sweep them off in midst of all these hosts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Assembled for that cause here as Thou seest,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To hell;⁠—the universal race of man.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But if ordained that not on them, but Thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Thine, old hate shall satisfy itself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Approach no nearer; for we live by death;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or turn the tide of fate, Thou sole who canst!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ceasing thereat, his host upraised a shout</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which shook the stars, and made them ring again.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our Lord to him then spake thus, mild as Spring,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Addressing earth when smiling she lets fall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All flowerets from her lips⁠—’Tis well there is a God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Lo! to what base extremes infernal pride</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can push a princely spirit once in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thee we will not destroy now, for thine hour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hath yet to come⁠—when least thou thinkest it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God’s wrath thou hast endured in punishment.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Not yet His power. Away! I warn ye hence</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ere wrath ride forth again. To Him the Fiend</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Answered: God rules not us the unordered damned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor recks of hell. For ages past belief,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Unless by those who like ourselves denied</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thine own eternity⁠—by creature mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>However lofty, hardly compassed⁠—we</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have borne our pain without remorse, or sign</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of pity from our Maker. Shall we now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Believe, while thus confronting Him again,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He means us better? Never worse than now.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therefore I say to ye, on! mightiest fiends,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On! Let us reap companions for our woes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or earn annihilation! At the word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>His fiery phalanx rushed to bar the way</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Him whose ways are over all His works.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A million spears blazed forth their answer bright,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As of as many tongues. Serene our ranks</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stood as the stars o’er thunder. God the Son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sat in His orbèd car, and breathed on them;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And they were rolled up like the desert sands</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Before the burning wind⁠—throne wrecked on throne,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All ruined and fordone. Pursue! He cried,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor let them near the earth I go to judge.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we pursued, as many as He chose,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And chased from sphere to sphere that wretched wreck</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of falsest fiends:⁠—and I, it seems, am first</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of all my victor brethren to declare</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The triumph past and coming, and to cheer</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Tour hearts with tidings of our Lord, to whom</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be glory for His universal deeds,</span>

								<span>Tearing earth’s empires up, nears death so close</span>

								<span>Die never. Being deathless, they but change</span>

								<span>Give then the dead their due; it is they who saved us.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The rapid and the deep⁠—the fall, the gulf</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have likenesses in feeling and in life.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And life, so varied, hath more loveliness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In one day than a creeping century</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of sameness. But youth loves and lives on change</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till the soul sighs for sameness; which at last</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Direct to God in Heaven; or some one else</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May seize them, seal them, send them⁠—you know where.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world must end. I weep to think of it.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But you, you laugh! I knew ye would. I know</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men never will be wise till they are fools</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For ever. Laugh away! The time will come,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When tears of fire are trickling from your eyes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye will blame yourselves for having laughed at me.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I warn ye, men: prepare! repent! be saved!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I warn ye, not because I love, but know ye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God will dissolve the world, as she of old</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her pearl, within His cup and swallow ye</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In wrath: although to taste ye would be poison,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And death and suicide to aught but God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Again I warn ye. Save himself who can!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Do ye not oft begin to seek salvation?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>You? you? and fail, as oft, to find? Sink? Cease?</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And shall I tell ye, brethren, why ye fail</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Once and for ever? why, there is no past;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the future is the fiction of a fiction;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The present moment is eternity;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is that ye have sucked corruption from the world</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like milk from your own mothers: it is in</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your soul-blood and your soul-bones. Earth does not</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wean one out of a thousand sons to Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Beginnings are alike: it is ends which differ.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One drop falls, lasts, and dries up⁠—but a drop;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Another begins a river: and one thought</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Settles a life, an immortality:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And that one thought ye will not take to good.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now I will tell ye just one other truth:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye hate the truth as snails salt⁠—it dissolves ye,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Body and soul⁠—but I don’t mind. So, now:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Up to this moment ye are all, each, damned.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>What are ye now? still damned! It will be the same</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To-morrow⁠—and the next day⁠—and the next:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till some fine morning ye will wake in fire.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye see I do not mince the truth for ye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Belike ye think your lives will dribble out</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As brooks in summer dry up. Let us see!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Try: dike them up: they stagnate⁠—thicken⁠—scum.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That would make life worse than death. Well, let go!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Where are ye then? for life, like water, will</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Find its last level: what level? The grave.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is but a fall of five feet after all;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That cannot hurt ye; it is but just enough</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To work the wheel of life; so work away!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ye may think that I do not know the terms</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And treasures whereupon ye live so high.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But I know more than most men, modestly</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Speaking. I know I am lost, and ye too. God</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Could only save me by destroying me;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>So that I have no advantage over you.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And therefore think ye will the rather bear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One of your own state to advise for ye</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now don’t you envy me, good folks, I pray⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Envy’s a coal comes hissing hot from hell.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>’Twill be such coals will burn ye by the way.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Your other preachers first think they are safe.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now I say, broadly, I am the worst among ye;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And God knows I have no need to wrong myself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor you. I boast not of it, but as truth:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>It is little to be proud of, credit me.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Bring out your balance: get in, man by man:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Add earth, heaven, hell, the universe; that’s all.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God puts his finger in the other scale,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And up we bounce, a bubble. Nought is great</span>

								<br/>

								<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>And you, of course, end with it. Now how long</span>

								<span>Who when he had slain the world and wasted it,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Drop down amid his quirks and sacred lies⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The judge, while dooming unto death some wretch,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall meet at once his own death, doom, and judge.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The doctor, watch in hand, and patient’s pulse,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall feel his own heart cease its beats⁠—and fall:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Professors shall spin out, and students strain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their brains no more; art, science, toil shall cease.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world shall stand still with a rending jar,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As though it struck at sea. The halls where sit</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The heads of nations shall be dumb with death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ship shall after her own plummet sink,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And sound the sea herself and depths, of death.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>At the first turn Death shall cut off the thief,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And dash the gold bag in his yellow brain.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The gambler, reckoning gains, shall drop a piece;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Stoop down and there see death;⁠—look up, there God.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The wanton, temporizing with decay,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And qualifying every line which vice</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Writes bluntly on the brow, inviting scorn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shall pale through plastered red: and the loose, low sot</span>
								<br/>
								<span>See clear, for once, through his misty, o’erbrimmed eye.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The just, if there be any, die in prayer.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Death shall be every where among your marts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And giving bills which no man may decline⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Drafts upon Hell one moment after date.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Then shall your outcries tremble amid the stars:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Terrors shall be about ye like a wind:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fears come down upon ye like a house.</span>

								<span>For the mere ends of personal pomp and power,</span>

								<br/>

								<span>They are but things like-natured with all nations;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That mountains issue out of plains, and not</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Plains out of mountains, and so likewise kings</span>

								<br/>
								<span>And let all feel, the rulers and the ruled,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All classes and all countries, that the world</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Nor priests they need fear so much as themselves;</span>

								<span>That if they keep but true to themselves, and free,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sober, enlightened, godly⁠—mortal men</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Become impassible as air, one great</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And indestructible substance as the sea.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let all on thrones and judgment-seats reflect</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How dreadful Thy revenge through nations is</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On those who wrong them; but do Thou grant, Lord!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That when wrongs are to be redressed, such may</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be done with mildness, speed, and firmness, not</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With violence or hate, whereby one wrong</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Translates another⁠—both to Thee abhorrent.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bells of time are ringing changes fast.</span>

								<span>Grant, Lord! that each fresh peal may usher in</span>

								<span>All party and religious difference</span>

								<span>To honourable ends, whether secured</span>

								<span>The best may then fail and the worst succeed</span>

								<br/>
								<span>For bodily strength, but more especially</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For the soul’s health and safety. We entreat Thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In thy great mercy to decrease our wants,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And add autumnal increase to the comforts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which tend to keep men innocent, and load</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their hearts with thanks to Thee as trees in bearing:⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The blessings of friends, families, and homes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And kindnesses of kindred. And we pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That men may rule themselves in faith in God,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In charity to each other, and in hope</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of their own souls’ salvation:⁠—that the mass,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The millions in all nations may be trained,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From their youth upwards, in a nobler mode,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To loftier and more liberal ends. We pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Above all things, Lord! that all men be free</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From bondage, whether of the mind or body;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The bondage of religious bigotry,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And bald antiquity, servility</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of thought or speech to rank and power; be all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Free as they ought to be in mind and soul</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As well as by state-birthright;⁠—and that Mind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Time’s giant pupil, may right soon attain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Majority, and speak and act for himself!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Incline Thou to our prayers, and grant, oh Lord!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all may have enough, and some safe mean</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of worldly goods and honours, by degrees,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Take place, if practicable, in the fitness</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fullness of Thy time. And we beseech Thee,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That Truth no more be gagged, nor conscience dungeoned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor science be impeached of godlessness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Nor faith be circumscribed, which as to Thee,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And the soul’s self affairs is infinite;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But that all men may have due liberty</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To speak an honest mind, in every land,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Encouragement to study, leave to act</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As conscience orders. We entreat Thee, Lord!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For Thy Son’s sake to take away reproach</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of all kinds from Thy church, and all temptation</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of pomp or power political, that none</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May err in the end for which they were appointed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To any of its orders, low or high;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And no ambition, of a worldly cast,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Leaven the love of souls unto whose care</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They feel propelled by Thy most holy spirit.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be every church established, Lord! in truth.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let all who preach the word, live by the word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In moderate estate; and in Thy church⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One, universal, and invisible</span>
								<br/>
								<span>World-wards, yet manifest unto itself,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May it seem good, dear Saviour, in Thy sight,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That orders be distinguished, not by wealth,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But piety and power of teaching souls.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Equalise labour, Lord! and recompence.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let not a hundred humble pastors starve,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In this or any land of Christendom,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>While one or two, impalaced, mitred, throned</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And banqueted, burlesque if not blaspheme</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The holy penury of the Son of God;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fastings, the footwanderings, and the preachings</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Christ and His first followers. Oh that the Son</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Might come again! There should be no more war,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>No more want, no more sickness; with a touch,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>He should cure all disease, and with a word,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All sin; and with a look to Heaven, a prayer,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Provide bread for a million at a time.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But till that perfect advent grant us, Lord!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all good institutions, orders, claims,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Charitably proposed, or in the aid</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Thy divine foundation, may much prosper,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And more of them be raised and nobly filled;⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That Thy word may be taught throughout all lands,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And save souls daily to the thrones of Heaven!⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And we entreat Thee, that all men whom Thou</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Hast gifted with great minds may love Thee well,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And praise Thee for their powers, and use them most</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Humbly and holily, and, lever-like,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Act but in lifting up the mass of mind</span>
								<br/>
								<span>About them; knowing well that they shall be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Questioned by Thee of deeds the pen hath done,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or caused, or glozed; inspire them with delight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And power to treat of noble themes and things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Worthily, and to leave the low and mean⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Things born of vice or day-lived fashion, in</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their naked native folly:⁠—make them know</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fine thoughts are wealth, for the right use of which</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Men are and ought to be accountable⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If not to Thee, to those they influence:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Grant this we pray Thee, and that all who read,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Or utter noble thoughts, may make them theirs,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And thank God for them, to the betterment</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of their succeeding life;⁠—that all who lead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The general sense and taste, too apt, perchance,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To be led, keep in mind the mighty good</span>
								<br/>
								<span>They may achieve, and are in conscience, bound,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And duty, to attempt unceasingly</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To compass. Grant us, All-maintaining Sire!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all the great mechanic aids to toil</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Man’s skill hath formed, found, rendered⁠—whether used</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In multiplying works of mind, or aught</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To obviate the thousand wants of life,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May much avail to human welfare now</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And in all ages, henceforth and for ever!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let their effect be, Lord! to lighten labour,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And give more room to mind, and leave the poor</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Some time for self-improvement. Let them not</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be forced to grind the bones out of their arms</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For bread, but have some space to think and feel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Like moral and immortal creatures. God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have mercy on them till such time shall come;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Look Thou with pity on all lesser crimes,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thrust on men almost when devoured by want,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wretchedness, ignorance and outcast life!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have mercy on the rich, too, who pass by</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The means they have at hand to fill their minds</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With serviceable knowledge for themselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And fellows, and support not the good cause</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the world’s better future! Oh, reward</span>
								<br/>
								<span>All such who do, with peace of heart and power</span>
								<br/>
								<span>For greater good. Have mercy, Lord! on each</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And all, for all men need it equally.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May peace and industry and commerce weld</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Into one land all nations of the world,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Rewedding those the Deluge once divorced.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! may all help each other in good things,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Mentally, morally, and bodily!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Vouchsafe, kind God! Thy blessing to this isle,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Specially! May our country ever lead</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The world, for she is worthiest; and may all</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Profit by her example, and adopt</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her course, wherever great, or free, or just.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May all her subject colonies and powers</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have of her freedom freely, as a child</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Receiveth of its parents. Let not rights</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be wrested from us to our own reproach,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But granted. We may make the whole world free,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And be as free ourselves as ever, more!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If policy or self-defence call forth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our forces to the field, let us in Thee</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Place, first, our trust, and in Thy name we shall</span>
								<br/>
								<span>O’ercome, for we will only wage the right.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Let us not conquer nations for ourselves,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But for Thee, Lord! who hast predestined us</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To fight the battles of the future now,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And so have done with war before Thou comest.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till then, Lord God of armies, let our foes</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have their swords broken and their cannon burst,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And their strong cities levelled; and while we</span>
								<br/>
								<span>War faithfully and righteously, improve,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Civilize, christianize the lands we win</span>
								<br/>
								<span>From savage or from nature, Thou, oh God!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wilt aid and hallow conquest, as of old,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thine own immediate nation’s. But we pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That all mankind may make one brotherhood,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And love and serve each other; that all wars</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And feuds die out of nations, whether those</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom the sun’s hot light darkens, or ourselves</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom he treats fairly, or the northern tribes</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whom ceaseless snows and starry winters blench,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Savage or civilized⁠—let every race,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bed, black or white, olive, or tawny-skinned,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Settle in peace and swell the gathering hosts</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of the great Prince of Peace! Oh! may the hour</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Soon come when all false gods, false creeds, false prophets⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Allowed in Thy good purpose for a time⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Demolished, the great world shall be at last,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The mercy-seat of God, the heritage</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of Christ, and the possession of the Spirit,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The comforter, the wisdom! shall all be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>One land, one home, one friend, one faith, one law,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its ruler God, its practice righteousness,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Its life peace! For the one true faith we pray</span>
								<br/>
								<span>There is but one in Heaven and there shall be</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But one on earth, the same which is in Heaven.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Prophecy is more true than history.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Grant us our prayers, we pray, Lord! in the name</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And for the sake of Thy Son Jesus Christ,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our Saviour and Redeemer, who with Thee,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>We stood a minute: neither spake</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What each must understand.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I told her, so she would be mine</span>

									<br/>
									<span>She straight should have a bridal bower</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Instead of gipsy tent.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Or would she have me wend with her,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The world between should fall;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For her I would fling up faith and friends,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And name, and fame, and all.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Her smile so bright froze while I spake,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ice was in her eye;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So near, it seemed ere touch her heart</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I might have kissed the sky.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I said that if she loved to rule,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or if she longed to reign,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I would make her Queen of every race</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which tearhke trode the world’s sad face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or bleed at every vein.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She laid her finger on her lip,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And pointed to the sky;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There is no God to come, she said:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dost thou not fear to die?</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>And what is God, I said, to thee?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Thy people worship not.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The good, the happy, and the free,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She said, they need no God.</span>

									<span>I looked until I lost mine eyes;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I felt as though I were</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And that was wasting fast away;</span>

									<span>I watched but would not stir.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>And read it o’er and o’er;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ah! eyes so young, so sweet, I said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Make as they read love’s lore.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She held my hand⁠—I trembled whilst⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For sorely soon I felt</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She made the love-cross she foretold</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And all the woe she dealt.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Unhappy I should be she said,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And young to death be given;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I told her I believed in her,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not in the stars of Heaven.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Hush! we breathe Heaven, she said, and bowed;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the stars speak through me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Let Heaven, I cried, take care of Heaven!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I only care for thee.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>She shrank: I looked, and begged a kiss:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I knew she had one for me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She would deny me none, she said,</span>

								<p>
									<span>I saw the tears start in her eye,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And trickle down her cheek,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Like falling stars across the sky,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Escaping from their Maker’s eye:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw, but spared to speak.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>Go, and forget! she said, and slid</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Below her lowly tent.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I will not, cannot⁠—hear me, girl!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She heard not, and I went.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>At eve, by sunset, I was there,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The tent was there no more;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The fire which warmed her flickered still⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The fire she sat before.</span>
								</p>
								<p>
									<span>I stood by it, till through the dark</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I saw not where it lay;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And then like that my heart went out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In ashy grief and gray.</span>

								<p>

									<br/>

								<span>The self-begot, self-wedded, and self-born,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Which the wind carries in its womb, all have,</span>

								<span>The water of immortal life still lives:⁠—</span>

								<br/>
								<span>That hope, nor love, nor fear, nor aught of earth</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Can check the royal lavishment of life;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>But like a streamer strown upon the wind,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We fling our souls to fate and to the future.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And to die young is youth’s divinest gift⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To pass from one world fresh into another,</span>

								<br/>
								<span>And follow it while strong⁠—is Heaven’s last mercy.</span>

								<span>Which shineth only when upon the wing;</span>

								<span>So is it with the mind: when once we rest,</span>
								<br/>
