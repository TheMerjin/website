									<span>Yet neither pleasure’s art can joy my spirits,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor yet the other’s distance comfort me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That have their first conception by mis-dread,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have after-nourishment and life by care;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And what was first but fear what might be done,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Grows elder now and cares it be not done.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And so with me: the great Antiochus,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>’Gainst whom I am too little to contend,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Since he’s so great can make his will his act,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Nor boots it me to say I honour him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If he suspect I may dishonour him:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And what may make him blush in being known,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He’ll stop the course by which it might be known;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With hostile forces he’ll o’erspread the land,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And with the ostent of war will look so huge,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Amazement shall drive courage from the state;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our men be vanquish’d ere they do resist,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And subjects punish’d that ne’er thought offence:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which care of them, not pity of myself,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who am no more but as the tops of trees,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And punish that before that he would punish.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Of earned praise, Marina’s life</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Seeks to take off by treason’s knife.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in this kind hath our Cleon</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One daughter, and a wench full grown,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hight Philoten: and it is said</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For certain in our story, she</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would ever with Marina be:</span>

									<span>Be’t when she weaved the sleided silk</span>

									<span>With fingers long, small, white as milk;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or when she would with sharp needle wound</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The cambric, which she made more sound</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By hurting it; or when to the lute</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She sung, and made the night-bird mute,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That still records with moan; or when</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She would with rich and constant pen</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Vail to her mistress Dian; still</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This Philoten contends in skill</span>
