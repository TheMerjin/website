			<h2 epub:type="title">Balin and Balan</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Pellam the King, who held and lost with Lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that first war, and had his realm restored</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rendered tributary, failed of late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To send his tribute; wherefore Arthur called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His treasurer, one of many years, and spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Go thou with him and him and bring it to us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest we should set one truer on his throne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man’s word is God in man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>His Baron said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“We go but harken: there be two strange knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sit near Camelot at a fountain-side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mile beneath the forest, challenging</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overthrowing every knight who comes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt thou I undertake them as we pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And send them to thee?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Arthur laughed upon him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Old friend, too old to be so young, depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delay not thou for aught, but let them sit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they find a lustier than themselves.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So these departed. Early, one fair dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The light-winged spirit of his youth returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Arthur’s heart; he armed himself and went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So coming to the fountain-side beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From underneath a plume of lady-fern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the right of Balin Balin’s horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was fast beside an alder, on the left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Balan Balan’s near a poplartree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair Sirs,” said Arthur, “wherefore sit ye here?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balin and Balan answered “For the sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glory; we be mightier men than all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s court; that also have we proved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whatsoever knight against us came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or I or he have easily overthrown.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I too,” said Arthur, “am of Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rather proven in his Paynim wars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lightly so returned, and no man knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The carolling water set themselves again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spake no word until the shadow turned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When from the fringe of coppice round them burst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spangled pursuivant, and crying “Sirs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balin the stillness of a minute broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying “An unmelodious name to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balin, ‘the Savage’⁠—that addition thine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brother and my better, this man here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balan. I smote upon the naked skull</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent me a three-years’ exile from thine eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have not lived my life delightsomely:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I that did that violence to thy thrall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had often wrought some fury on myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saving for Balan: those three kingless years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have past⁠—were wormwood-bitter to me. King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Methought that if we sat beside the well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against us, thou would’st take me gladlier back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than twenty Balins, Balan knight. I have said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not so⁠—not all. A man of thine today</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abashed us both, and brake my boast. Thy will?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Arthur “Thou hast ever spoken truth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise, my true knight. As children learn, be thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To music with thine Order and the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along the walls and down the board; they sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cup clashed cup; they drank and someone sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those banners of twelve battles overhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur’s host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Balan added to their Order lived</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wealthier life than heretofore with these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Balin, till their embassage returned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sir King,” they brought report, “we hardly found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And finds himself descended from the Saint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arimathaean Joseph; him who first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He boasts his life as purer than thine own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or dame or damsel enter at his gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest he should be polluted. This gray King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders⁠—yea⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By holy Joseph thither, that same spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He much amazed us; after, when we sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tribute, answered ‘I have quite foregone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All matters of this world: Garlon, mine heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him demand it,’ which this Garlon gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With much ado, railing at thine and thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But when we left, in those deep woods we found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reported of some demon in the woods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all his fellows, lived alone, and came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To learn black magic, and to hate his kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a hate, that when he died, his soul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strikes from behind. This woodman showed the cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We saw the hoof-print of a horse, no more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur, “Let who goes before me, see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He do not fall behind me: foully slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And villainously! who will hunt for me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This demon of the woods?” Said Balan, “I!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Embracing Balin, “Good my brother, hear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Witness their flowery welcome. Bound are they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speak no evil. Truly save for fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My fears for thee, so rich a fellowship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would make me wholly blest: thou one of them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be one indeed: consider them, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their bearing in their common bond of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more of jealousy than in Paradise.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who⁠—for but three brief moons had glanced away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From being knighted till he smote the thrall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And faded from the presence into years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of exile⁠—now would strictlier set himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In passing, and a transitory word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From being smiled at happier in themselves⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one from out his village lately climed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought report of azure lands and fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far seen to left and right; and he himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up from the base: so Balin marvelling oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Groaned, and at times would mutter, “These be gifts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond my reach. Well had I foughten⁠—well⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In those fierce wars, struck hard⁠—and had I crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So⁠—better!⁠—But this worship of the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That honour too wherein she holds him⁠—this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was the sunshine that hath given the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A growth, a name that branches o’er the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strength against all odds, and what the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So prizes⁠—overprizes⁠—gentleness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her likewise would I worship an I might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never can be close with her, as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That brought her hither. Shall I pray the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To let me bear some token of his Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon to gaze, remembering her⁠—forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My heats and violences? live afresh?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so stately-gentle, would she make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She greeted my return! Bold will I be⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What wilt thou bear?” Balin was bold, and asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who answered “Thou shalt put the crown to use.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crown is but the shadow of the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this a shadow’s shadow, let him have it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So this will help him of his violences!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No shadow,” said Sir Balin, “O my Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But light to me! no shadow, O my King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But golden earnest of a gentler life!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made music, and he felt his being move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In music with his Order, and the King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath ever and anon a note so thin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seems another voice in other groves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The music in him seemed to change, and grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faint and far-off.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And once he saw the thrall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His passion half had gauntleted to death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That causer of his banishment and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The memory of that cognizance on shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Too high this mount of Camelot for me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These high-set courtesies are not for me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierier and stormier from restraining, break</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into some madness even before the Queen?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glancing on the window, when the gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rages in the woodland far below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So when his moods were darkened, court and King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the kindly warmth of Arthur’s hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shadowed an angry distance: yet he strove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To learn the graces of their Table, fought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A walk of roses ran from door to door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down that range of roses the great Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all in shadow from the counter door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her “Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea so,” she said, “but so to pass me by⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let be: ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea⁠—for a dream. Last night methought I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In yonder shrine. All round her prest the dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the light upon her silver face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes⁠—away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For see, how perfect-pure! As light a flush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As hardly tints the blossom of the quince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sweeter to me,” she said, “this garden rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In those fair days⁠—not all as cool as these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though season-earlier. Art thou sad? or sick?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our noble King will send thee his own leech⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sick? or for any matter angered at me?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall: her hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Changed at his gaze: so turning side by side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They past, and Balin started from his bower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father hath begotten me in his wrath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I suffer from the things before me, know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A churl, a clown!” and in him gloom on gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deepened: he sharply caught his lance and shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fountain where they sat together, sighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Was I not better there with him?” and rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The skyless woods, but under open blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearily hewing. “Churl, thine axe!” he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If arm of flesh could lay him.” Balin cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay,” said the churl, “our devil is a truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw the flash of him but yestereven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some do say that our Sir Garlon too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look to the cave.” But Balin answered him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look to thy woodcraft,” and so leaving him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now with slack rein and careless of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now with dug spur and raving at himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past eastward from the falling sun. At once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sideways he started from the path, and saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A light of armour by him flash, and pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vanish in the woods; and followed this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all so blind in rage that unawares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He burst his lance against a forest bough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far, till the castle of a King, the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The battlement overtopt with ivytods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A home of bats, in every tower an owl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then spake the men of Pellam crying “Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Balin “For the fairest and the best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ladies living gave me this to bear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But found the greetings both of knight and King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faint in the low dark hall of banquet: leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid their green faces flat against the panes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why wear ye that crown-royal?” Balin said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fairest, best and purest, granted me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear it!” Such a sound (for Arthur’s knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fairest I grant her: I have seen; but best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Best, purest? thou from Arthur’s hall, and yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So far besotted that they fail to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holy Joseph’s legend, on his right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood, all of massiest bronze: one side had sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was rough with wattling, and the walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through memory of that token on the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Relaxed his hold: “I will be gentle,” he thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And passing gentle,” caught his hand away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then fiercely to Sir Garlon “Eyes have I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That saw today the shadow of a spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shot from behind me, run along the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From homage to the best and purest, might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mouth so huge a foulness⁠—to thy guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me, me of Arthur’s Table. Felon talk!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let be! no more!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But not the less by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stung him in dreams. At length, and dim through leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whined in the wood. He rose, descended, met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scorner in the castle court, and fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hate and loathing, would have past him by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery “Ha!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Balin by the banneret of his helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sounded across the court, and⁠—men-at-arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A score with pointed lances, making at him⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The portal of King Pellam’s chapel wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And inward to the wall; he stept behind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld before a golden altar lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blindfold rummage buried in the walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might echo, ran the counter path, and found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His charger, mounted on him and away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One overhead; and Pellam’s feeble cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With earthly uses”⁠—made him quickly dive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arising wearily at a fallen oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee will I bear no more,” high on a branch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there in gloom cast himself all along,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moaning “My violences, my violences!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now the wholesome music of the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kindled all the plain and all the wold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The new leaf ever pushes off the old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old monk and nun, ye scorn the world’s desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wayside blossoms open to the blaze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The whole wood-world is one full peal of praise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The fire of Heaven is lord of all things good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And starve not thou this fire within thy blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But follow Vivien through the fiery flood!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then turning to her Squire: “This fire of Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beat the cross to earth, and break the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his Table.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then they reached a glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where under one long lane of cloudless air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before another wood, the royal crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amazed were these; “Lo there,” she cried⁠—“a crown⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there a horse! the rider? where is he?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not dead; he stirs!⁠—but sleeping. I will speak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But bounden art thou, if from Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help the weak. Behold, I fly from shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lustful King, who sought to win my love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through evil ways: the knight, with whom I rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arthur the blameless, pure as any maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get me shelter for my maidenhood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge thee by that crown upon thy shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the great Queen’s name, arise and hence.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Balin rose, “Thither no more! nor Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor knight am I, but one that hath defamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cognizance she gave me: here I dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Savage among the savage woods, here die⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Die: let the wolves’ black maws ensepulchre</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their brother beast, whose anger was his lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O me, that such a name as Guinevere’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which our high Lancelot hath so lifted up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And been thereby uplifted, should through me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My violence, and my villainy, come to shame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill, anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighed all as suddenly. Said Balin to her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is this thy courtesy⁠—to mock me, ha?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence, for I will not with thee.” Again she sighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pardon, sweet lord! we maidens often laugh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When sick at heart, when rather we should weep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I knew thee wronged. I brake upon thy rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now full loth am I to break thy dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou art man, and canst abide a truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though bitter. Hither, boy⁠—and mark me well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost thou remember at Caerleon once⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A year ago⁠—nay, then I love thee not⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, thou rememberest well⁠—one summer dawn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the great tower⁠—Caerleon upon Usk⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, truly we were hidden: this fair lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flower of all their vestal knighthood, knelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In amorous homage⁠—knelt⁠—what else?⁠—O ay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knelt, and drew down from out his night-black hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had wandered from her own King’s golden head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost itself in darkness, till she cried⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought the great tower would crash down on both⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Rise, my sweet King, and kiss me on the lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou art my King.’ This lad, whose lightest word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is mere white truth in simple nakedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw them embrace: he reddens, cannot speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So bashful, he! but all the maiden Saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deathless mother-maidenhood of Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cry out upon her. Up then, ride with me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Talk not of shame! thou canst not, an thou would’st,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do these more shame than these have done themselves.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She lied with ease; but horror-stricken he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering that dark bower at Camelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathed in a dismal whisper: “It is truth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sunnily she smiled: “And even in this lone wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fools prate, and perish traitors. Woods have tongues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As walls have ears: but thou shalt go with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we will speak at first exceeding low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meet is it the good King be not deceived.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stoop at thy will on Lancelot and the Queen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ceased; his evil spirit upon him leapt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He ground his teeth together, sprang with a yell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore from the branch, and cast on earth, the shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stampt all into defacement, hurled it from him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the forest weeds, and cursed the tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The told-of, and the teller.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>That weird yell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then nearing “Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tramples on the goodly shield to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His loathing of our Order and the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My quest, meseems, is here. Or devil or man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guard thou thine head.” Sir Balin spake not word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In onset, and King Pellam’s holy spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reputed to be red with sinless blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Redded at once with sinful, for the point</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin’s horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to her Squire muttered the damsel: “Fools!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus foamed over at a rival name:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet hast often pleaded for my love⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See what I see, be thou where I have been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else Sir Chick⁠—dismount and loose their casques</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fain would know what manner of men they be.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the Squire had loosed them, “Goodly!⁠—look!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead for one heifer!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then the gentle Squire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I hold them happy, so they died for love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, Vivien, though ye beat me like your dog,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I too could die, as now I live, for thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Live on, Sir Boy,” she cried. “I better prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The living dog than the dead lion: away!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot brook to gaze upon the dead.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then leapt her palfrey o’er the fallen oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bounding forward “Leave them to the wolves.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when their foreheads felt the cooling air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Balin first woke, and seeing that true face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Familiar up from cradle-time, so wan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on his dying brother cast himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dying; and he lifted faint eyes; he felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One near him; all at once they found the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drawing down the dim disastrous brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That o’er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save thy life, have brought thee to thy death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why had ye not the shield I knew? and why</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trampled ye thus on that which bare the Crown?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Balin told him brokenly, and in gasps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that had chanced, and Balan moaned again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Brother, I dwelt a day in Pellam’s hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Garlon mocked me, but I heeded not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one said ‘Eat in peace! a liar is he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hates thee for the tribute!’ this good knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told me, that twice a wanton damsel came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sought for Garlon at the castle-gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Pellam drove away with holy heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe this damsel, and the one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who stood beside thee even now, the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘She dwells among the woods,’ he said, ‘and meets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dallies with him in the Mouth of Hell.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foul are their lives; foul are their lips; they lied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pure as our own true Mother is our Queen.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O brother,” answered Balin, “woe is me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My madness all thy life has been thy doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy curse, and darkened all thy day; and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The night has come. I scarce can see thee now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goodnight! for we shall never bid again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goodmorrow⁠—Dark my doom was here, and dark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will be there. I see thee now no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would not mine again should darken thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goodnight, true brother.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Balan answered low</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Goodnight, true brother here! goodmorrow there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We two were born together, and we die</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together by one doom:” and while he spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed his death-drowsing eyes, and slept the sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Balin, either locked in either’s arm.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Dedication</h2>
			<p>
				<span>These to His Memory⁠—since he held them dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance as finding there unconsciously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some image of himself⁠—I dedicate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I dedicate, I consecrate with tears⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These Idylls.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And indeed He seems to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce other than my king’s ideal knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who reverenced his conscience as his king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose glory was, redressing human wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loved one only and who clave to her⁠—”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her⁠—over all whose realms to their last isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Commingled with the gloom of imminent war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darkening the world. We have lost him: he is gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We know him now: all narrow jealousies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are silent; and we see him as he moved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With what sublime repression of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in what limits, and how tenderly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not swaying to this faction or to that;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not making his high place the lawless perch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of winged ambitions, nor a vantage-ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pleasure; but through all this tract of years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a thousand peering littlenesses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that fierce light which beats upon a throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blackens every blot: for where is he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dares foreshadow for an only son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how should England dreaming of his sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hope more for these than some inheritance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of such a life, a heart, a mind as thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou noble Father of her Kings to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laborious for her people and her poor⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of letters, dear to Science, dear to Art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all titles, and a household name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter, through all times, Albert the Good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Break not, O woman’s-heart, but still endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering all the beauty of that star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One light together, but has past and leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Crown a lonely splendour.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>May all love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His love, unseen but felt, o’ershadow Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The love of all Thy daughters cherish Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The love of all Thy people comfort Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till God’s love set Thee at his side again!</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Gareth and Lynette</h2>
			<p>
				<span>The last tall son of Lot and Bellicent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tallest, Gareth, in a showerful spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stared at the spate. A slender-shafted Pine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost footing, fell, and so was whirled away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How he went down,” said Gareth, “as a false knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or evil king before my lance if lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were mine to use⁠—O senseless cataract,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing all down in thy precipitancy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet thou art but swollen with cold snows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mine is living blood: thou dost His will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Maker’s, and not knowest, and I that know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have strength and wit, in my good mother’s hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Linger with vacillating obedience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prisoned, and kept and coaxed and whistled to⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since the good mother holds me still a child!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good mother is bad mother unto me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A worse were better; yet no worse would I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaven yield her for it, but in me put force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To weary her ears with one continuous prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until she let me fly discaged to sweep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In ever-highering eagle-circles up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the great Sun of Glory, and thence swoop</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down upon all things base, and dash them dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knight of Arthur, working out his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cleanse the world. Why, Gawain, when he came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Modred hither in the summertime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked me to tilt with him, the proven knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Modred for want of worthier was the judge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I so shook him in the saddle, he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Thou hast half prevailed against me,’ said so⁠—he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though Modred biting his thin lips was mute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he is alway sullen: what care I?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth went, and hovering round her chair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked, “Mother, though ye count me still the child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet mother, do ye love the child?” She laughed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art but a wild-goose to question it.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then, mother, an ye love the child,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Being a goose and rather tame than wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear the child’s story.” “Yea, my well-beloved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ’twere but of the goose and golden eggs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was finer gold than any goose can lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this an Eagle, a royal Eagle, laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost beyond eye-reach, on such a palm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there was ever haunting round the palm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lusty youth, but poor, who often saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The splendour sparkling from aloft, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then were I wealthier than a leash of kings.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ever when he reached a hand to climb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One, that had loved him from his childhood, caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stayed him, ‘Climb not lest thou break thy neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge thee by my love,’ and so the boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet mother, neither clomb, nor brake his neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But brake his very heart in pining for it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>To whom the mother said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“True love, sweet son, had risked himself and climbed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And handed down the golden treasure to him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Gold? said I gold?⁠—ay then, why he, or she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whosoe’er it was, or half the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had ventured⁠—had the thing I spake of been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mere gold⁠—but this was all of that true steel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof they forged the brand Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lightnings played about it in the storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the little fowl were flurried at it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there were cries and clashings in the nest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sent him from his senses: let me go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Bellicent bemoaned herself and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hast thou no pity upon my loneliness?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo, where thy father Lot beside the hearth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies like a log, and all but smouldered out!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ever since when traitor to the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fought against him in the Barons’ war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur gave him back his territory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A yet-warm corpse, and yet unburiable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And both thy brethren are in Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit neither loved with that full love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I feel for thee, nor worthy such a love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stay therefore thou; red berries charm the bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thee, mine innocent, the jousts, the wars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who never knewest finger-ache, nor pang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of wrenched or broken limb⁠—an often chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In those brain-stunning shocks, and tourney-falls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frights to my heart; but stay: follow the deer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By these tall firs and our fast-falling burns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So make thy manhood mightier day by day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet is the chase: and I will seek thee out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some comfortable bride and fair, to grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy climbing life, and cherish my prone year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till falling into Lot’s forgetfulness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not thee, myself, nor anything.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stay, my best son! ye are yet more boy than man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Gareth, “An ye hold me yet for child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear yet once more the story of the child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, mother, there was once a King, like ours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prince his heir, when tall and marriageable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked for a bride; and thereupon the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set two before him. One was fair, strong, armed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to be won by force⁠—and many men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desired her; one good lack, no man desired.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these were the conditions of the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That save he won the first by force, he needs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must wed that other, whom no man desired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A red-faced bride who knew herself so vile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That evermore she longed to hide herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor fronted man or woman, eye to eye⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea⁠—some she cleaved to, but they died of her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one⁠—they called her Fame; and one⁠—O Mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How can ye keep me tethered to you⁠—Shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man am I grown, a man’s work must I do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Follow the deer? follow the Christ, the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else, wherefore born?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>To whom the mother said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sweet son, for there be many who deem him not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or will not deem him, wholly proven King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit in mine own heart I knew him King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I was frequent with him in my youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard him Kingly speak, and doubted him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more than he, himself; but felt him mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of closest kin to me: yet⁠—wilt thou leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine easeful biding here, and risk thine all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Life, limbs, for one that is not proven King?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stay, till the cloud that settles round his birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath lifted but a little. Stay, sweet son.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth answered quickly, “Not an hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that ye yield me⁠—I will walk through fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mother, to gain it⁠—your full leave to go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not proven, who swept the dust of ruined Rome</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From off the threshold of the realm, and crushed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Idolaters, and made the people free?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who should be King save him who makes us free?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So when the Queen, who long had sought in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break him from the intent to which he grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found her son’s will unwaveringly one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered craftily, “Will ye walk through fire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who walks through fire will hardly heed the smoke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, go then, an ye must: only one proof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before thou ask the King to make thee knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thine obedience and thy love to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy mother⁠—I demand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And Gareth cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A hard one, or a hundred, so I go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—quick! the proof to prove me to the quick!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But slowly spake the mother looking at him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Prince, thou shalt go disguised to Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the scullions and the kitchen-knaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those that hand the dish across the bar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shalt thou tell thy name to anyone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For so the Queen believed that when her son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld his only way to glory lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low down through villain kitchen-vassalage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own true Gareth was too princely-proud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pass thereby; so should he rest with her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed in her castle from the sound of arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Silent awhile was Gareth, then replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The thrall in person may be free in soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I shall see the jousts. Thy son am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since thou art my mother, must obey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I therefore yield me freely to thy will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hence will I, disguised, and hire myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve with scullions and with kitchen-knaves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor tell my name to any⁠—no, not the King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gareth awhile lingered. The mother’s eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of the wistful fear that he would go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turning toward him wheresoe’er he turned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perplext his outward purpose, till an hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When wakened by the wind which with full voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swept bellowing through the darkness on to dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rose, and out of slumber calling two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That still had tended on him from his birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the wakeful mother heard him, went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The three were clad like tillers of the soil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Southward they set their faces. The birds made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Melody on branch, and melody in mid air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damp hill-slopes were quickened into green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the live green had kindled into flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For it was past the time of Easterday.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, when their feet were planted on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That broadened toward the base of Camelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far off they saw the silver-misty morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolling her smoke about the Royal mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rose between the forest and the field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At times the summit of the high city flashed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At times the spires and turrets halfway down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pricked through the mist; at times the great gate shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only, that opened on the field below:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon, the whole fair city had disappeared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then those who went with Gareth were amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One crying, “Let us go no further, lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here is a city of Enchanters, built</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By fairy Kings.” The second echoed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lord, we have heard from our wise man at home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Northward, that this King is not the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But only changeling out of Fairyland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who drave the heathen hence by sorcery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Merlin’s glamour.” Then the first again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lord, there is no such city anywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all a vision.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Gareth answered them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laughter, swearing he had glamour enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his own blood, his princedom, youth and hopes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To plunge old Merlin in the Arabian sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So pushed them all unwilling toward the gate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there was no gate like it under heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For barefoot on the keystone, which was lined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rippled like an ever-fleeting wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lady of the Lake stood: all her dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept from her sides as water flowing away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like the cross her great and goodly arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stretched under the cornice and upheld:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drops of water fell from either hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down from one a sword was hung, from one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A censer, either worn with wind and storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er her breast floated the sacred fish;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the space to left of her, and right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were Arthur’s wars in weird devices done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New things and old co-twisted, as if Time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were nothing, so inveterately, that men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were giddy gazing there; and over all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on the top were those three Queens, the friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur, who should help him at his need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then those with Gareth for so long a space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stared at the figures, that at last it seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dragon-boughts and elvish emblemings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to move, seethe, twine and curl: they called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Gareth, “Lord, the gateway is alive.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth likewise on them fixt his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long, that even to him they seemed to move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the city a blast of music pealed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back from the gate started the three, to whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From out thereunder came an ancient man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long-bearded, saying, “Who be ye, my sons?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Gareth, “We be tillers of the soil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who leaving share in furrow come to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glories of our King: but these, my men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Your city moved so weirdly in the mist)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doubt if the King be King at all, or come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Fairyland; and whether this be built</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By magic, and by fairy Kings and Queens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether there be any city at all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or all a vision: and this music now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath scared them both, but tell thou these the truth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then that old Seer made answer playing on him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saying, “Son, I have seen the good ship sail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Keel upward, and mast downward, in the heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And solid turrets topsy-turvy in air:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here is truth; but an it please thee not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take thou the truth as thou hast told it me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truly as thou sayest, a Fairy King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Fairy Queens have built the city, son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They came from out a sacred mountain-cleft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward the sunrise, each with harp in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And built it to the music of their harps.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as thou sayest, it is enchanted, son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there is nothing in it as it seems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saving the King; though some there be that hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King a shadow, and the city real:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet take thou heed of him, for, so thou pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thrall to his enchantments, for the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will bind thee by such vows, as is a shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man should not be bound by, yet the which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No man can keep; but, so thou dread to swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without, among the cattle of the field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For an ye heard a music, like enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They are building still, seeing the city is built</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To music, therefore never built at all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore built forever.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Gareth spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Angered, “Old master, reverence thine own beard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That looks as white as utter truth, and seems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wellnigh as long as thou art statured tall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why mockest thou the stranger that hath been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thee fair-spoken?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But the Seer replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know ye not then the Riddling of the Bards?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Confusion, and illusion, and relation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elusion, and occasion, and evasion’?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mock thee not but as thou mockest me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that see thee, for thou art not who</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou seemest, but I know thee who thou art.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now thou goest up to mock the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who cannot brook the shadow of any lie.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unmockingly the mocker ending here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned to the right, and past along the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Gareth looking after said, “My men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our one white lie sits like a little ghost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here on the threshold of our enterprise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let love be blamed for it, not she, nor I:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, we will make amends.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>With all good cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spake and laughed, then entered with his twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Camelot, a city of shadowy palaces</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stately, rich in emblem and the work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ancient kings who did their days in stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which Merlin’s hand, the Mage at Arthur’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowing all arts, had touched, and everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Arthur’s ordinance, tipt with lessening peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pinnacle, and had made it spire to heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever and anon a knight would pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Outward, or inward to the hall: his arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clashed; and the sound was good to Gareth’s ear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of bower and casement shyly glanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eyes of pure women, wholesome stars of love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all about a healthful people stept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in the presence of a gracious king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then into hall Gareth ascending heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice, the voice of Arthur, and beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far over heads in that long-vaulted hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The splendour of the presence of the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Throned, and delivering doom⁠—and looked no more⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But felt his young heart hammering in his ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought, “For this half-shadow of a lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truthful King will doom me when I speak.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet pressing on, though all in fear to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Gawain or Sir Modred, saw nor one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor other, but in all the listening eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those tall knights, that ranged about the throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear honour shining like the dewy star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of dawn, and faith in their great King, with pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Affection, and the light of victory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glory gained, and evermore to gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came a widow crying to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A boon, Sir King! Thy father, Uther, reft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From my dead lord a field with violence:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For howsoe’er at first he proffered gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, for the field was pleasant in our eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We yielded not; and then he reft us of it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perforce, and left us neither gold nor field.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said Arthur, “Whether would ye? gold or field?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the woman weeping, “Nay, my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The field was pleasant in my husband’s eye.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Arthur, “Have thy pleasant field again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrice the gold for Uther’s use thereof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to the years. No boon is here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But justice, so thy say be proven true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accursed, who from the wrongs his father did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would shape himself a right!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And while she past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came yet another widow crying to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A boon, Sir King! Thine enemy, King, am I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With thine own hand thou slewest my dear lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knight of Uther in the Barons’ war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Lot and many another rose and fought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against thee, saying thou wert basely born.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I held with these, and loathe to ask thee aught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet lo! my husband’s brother had my son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thralled in his castle, and hath starved him dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And standeth seized of that inheritance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which thou that slewest the sire hast left the son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So though I scarce can ask it thee for hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me some knight to do the battle for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then strode a good knight forward, crying to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A boon, Sir King! I am her kinsman, I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me to right her wrong, and slay the man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then came Sir Kay, the seneschal, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A boon, Sir King! even that thou grant her none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This railer, that hath mocked thee in full hall⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None; or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Arthur, “We sit King, to help the wronged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all our realm. The woman loves her lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace to thee, woman, with thy loves and hates!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kings of old had doomed thee to the flames,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aurelius Emrys would have scourged thee dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Uther slit thy tongue: but get thee hence⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest that rough humour of the kings of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return upon me! Thou that art her kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go likewise; lay him low and slay him not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But bring him here, that I may judge the right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to the justice of the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, be he guilty, by that deathless King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lived and died for men, the man shall die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then came in hall the messenger of Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A name of evil savour in the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cornish king. In either hand he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What dazzled all, and shone far-off as shines</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A field of charlock in the sudden sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between two showers, a cloth of palest gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which down he laid before the throne, and knelt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delivering, that his lord, the vassal king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was even upon his way to Camelot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For having heard that Arthur of his grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made his goodly cousin, Tristram, knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, for himself was of the greater state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being a king, he trusted his liege-lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would yield him this large honour all the more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So prayed him well to accept this cloth of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In token of true heart and fealty.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur cried to rend the cloth, to rend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In pieces, and so cast it on the hearth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An oak-tree smouldered there. “The goodly knight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What! shall the shield of Mark stand among these?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, midway down the side of that long hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stately pile⁠—whereof along the front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some blazoned, some but carven, and some blank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There ran a treble range of stony shields⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose, and high-arching overbrowed the hearth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And under every shield a knight was named:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this was Arthur’s custom in his hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When some good knight had done one noble deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His arms were carven only; but if twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His arms were blazoned also; but if none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shield was blank and bare without a sign</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saving the name beneath; and Gareth saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shield of Gawain blazoned rich and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Modred’s blank as death; and Arthur cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rend the cloth and cast it on the hearth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“More like are we to reave him of his crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than make him knight because men call him king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kings we found, ye know we stayed their hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From war among themselves, but left them kings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom were any bounteous, merciful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Truth-speaking, brave, good livers, them we enrolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among us, and they sit within our hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as Mark hath tarnished the great name of king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Mark would sully the low state of churl:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, seeing he hath sent us cloth of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return, and meet, and hold him from our eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest we should lap him up in cloth of lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silenced forever⁠—craven⁠—a man of plots,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Craft, poisonous counsels, wayside ambushings⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No fault of thine: let Kay the seneschal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look to thy wants, and send thee satisfied⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accursed, who strikes nor lets the hand be seen!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And many another suppliant crying came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With noise of ravage wrought by beast and man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And evermore a knight would ride away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Last, Gareth leaning both hands heavily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on the shoulders of the twain, his men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approached between them toward the King, and asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A boon, Sir King (his voice was all ashamed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For see ye not how weak and hungerworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seem⁠—leaning on these? grant me to serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For meat and drink among thy kitchen-knaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A twelvemonth and a day, nor seek my name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter I will fight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>To him the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A goodly youth and worth a goodlier boon!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But so thou wilt no goodlier, then must Kay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The master of the meats and drinks, be thine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He rose and past; then Kay, a man of mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wan-sallow as the plant that feels itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Root-bitten by white lichen,</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Lo ye now!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This fellow hath broken from some Abbey, where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God wot, he had not beef and brewis enow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However that might chance! but an he work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like any pigeon will I cram his crop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sleeker shall he shine than any hog.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lancelot standing near, “Sir Seneschal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleuth-hound thou knowest, and gray, and all the hounds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horse thou knowest, a man thou dost not know:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad brows and fair, a fluent hair and fine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High nose, a nostril large and fine, and hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Large, fair and fine!⁠—Some young lad’s mystery⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, or from sheepcot or king’s hall, the boy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is noble-natured. Treat him with all grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest he should come to shame thy judging of him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Kay, “What murmurest thou of mystery?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Think ye this fellow will poison the King’s dish?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, for he spake too fool-like: mystery!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tut, an the lad were noble, he had asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For horse and armour: fair and fine, forsooth!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Fine-face, Sir Fair-hands? but see thou to it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thine own fineness, Lancelot, some fine day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Undo thee not⁠—and leave my man to me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Gareth all for glory underwent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate with young lads his portion by the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And couched at night with grimy kitchen-knaves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot ever spake him pleasantly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Kay the seneschal, who loved him not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would hustle and harry him, and labour him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond his comrade of the hearth, and set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To turn the broach, draw water, or hew wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or grosser tasks; and Gareth bowed himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all obedience to the King, and wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All kind of service with a noble ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That graced the lowliest act in doing it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the thralls had talk among themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one would praise the love that linkt the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot⁠—how the King had saved his life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle twice, and Lancelot once the King’s⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot was the first in Tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur mightiest on the battle-field⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gareth was glad. Or if some other told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How once the wandering forester at dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far over the blue tarns and hazy seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Caer-Eryri’s highest found the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A naked babe, of whom the Prophet spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He passes to the Isle Avilion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He passes and is healed and cannot die”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gareth was glad. But if their talk were foul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then would he whistle rapid as any lark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or carol some old roundelay, and so loud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That first they mocked, but, after, reverenced him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Gareth telling some prodigious tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of knights, who sliced a red life-bubbling way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through twenty folds of twisted dragon, held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a gap-mouthed circle his good mates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lying or sitting round him, idle hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charmed; till Sir Kay, the seneschal, would come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blustering upon them, like a sudden wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among dead leaves, and drive them all apart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or when the thralls had sport among themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So there were any trial of mastery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, by two yards in casting bar or stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was counted best; and if there chanced a joust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that Sir Kay nodded him leave to go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would hurry thither, and when he saw the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clash like the coming and retiring wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the spear spring, and good horse reel, the boy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was half beyond himself for ecstasy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So for a month he wrought among the thralls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the weeks that followed, the good Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repentant of the word she made him swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saddening in her childless castle, sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between the in-crescent and de-crescent moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms for her son, and loosed him from his vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This, Gareth hearing from a squire of Lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With whom he used to play at tourney once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When both were children, and in lonely haunts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would scratch a ragged oval on the sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each at either dash from either end⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame never made girl redder than Gareth joy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laughed; he sprang. “Out of the smoke, at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I leap from Satan’s foot to Peter’s knee⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These news be mine, none other’s⁠—nay, the King’s⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descend into the city:” whereon he sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King alone, and found, and told him all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I have staggered thy strong Gawain in a tilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pastime; yea, he said it: joust can I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make me thy knight⁠—in secret! let my name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be hidden, and give me the first quest, I spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like flame from ashes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Here the King’s calm eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell on, and checked, and made him flush, and bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lowly, to kiss his hand, who answered him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Son, the good mother let me know thee here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sent her wish that I would yield thee thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make thee my knight? my knights are sworn to vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of utter hardihood, utter gentleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, loving, utter faithfulness in love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And uttermost obedience to the King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Gareth, lightly springing from his knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My King, for hardihood I can promise thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For uttermost obedience make demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom ye gave me to, the Seneschal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No mellow master of the meats and drinks!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as for love, God wot, I love not yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But love I shall, God willing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Make thee my knight in secret? yea, but he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our noblest brother, and our truest man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one with me in all, he needs must know.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let Lancelot know, my King, let Lancelot know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy noblest and thy truest!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And the King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“But wherefore would ye men should wonder at you?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, rather for the sake of me, their King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the deed’s sake my knighthood do the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to be noised of.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Merrily Gareth asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have I not earned my cake in baking of it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let be my name until I make my name!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My deeds will speak: it is but for a day.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So with a kindly hand on Gareth’s arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiled the great King, and half-unwillingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, after summoning Lancelot privily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have given him the first quest: he is not proven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look therefore when he calls for this in hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou get to horse and follow him far away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cover the lions on thy shield, and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far as thou mayest, he be nor ta’en nor slain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then that same day there past into the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A damsel of high lineage, and a brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May-blossom, and a cheek of apple-blossom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hawk-eyes; and lightly was her slender nose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tip-tilted like the petal of a flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She into hall past with her page and cried,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O King, for thou hast driven the foe without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See to the foe within! bridge, ford, beset</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By bandits, everyone that owns a tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lord for half a league. Why sit ye there?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest would I not, Sir King, an I were king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till even the lonest hold were all as free</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From cursed bloodshed, as thine altar-cloth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From that best blood it is a sin to spill.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Comfort thyself,” said Arthur. “I nor mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest: so my knighthood keep the vows they swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wastest moorland of our realm shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Safe, damsel, as the centre of this hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is thy name? thy need?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“My name?” she said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lynette my name; noble; my need, a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To combat for my sister, Lyonors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lady of high lineage, of great lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And comely, yea, and comelier than myself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She lives in Castle Perilous: a river</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Runs in three loops about her living-place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er it are three passings, and three knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Defend the passings, brethren, and a fourth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of that four the mightiest, holds her stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her own castle, and so besieges her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break her will, and make her wed with him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And but delays his purport till thou send</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To do the battle with him, thy chief man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot whom he trusts to overthrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then wed, with glory: but she will not wed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save whom she loveth, or a holy life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now therefore have I come for Lancelot.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur mindful of Sir Gareth asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Damsel, ye know this Order lives to crush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All wrongers of the Realm. But say, these four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who be they? What the fashion of the men?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They be of foolish fashion, O Sir King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fashion of that old knight-errantry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ride abroad, and do but what they will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courteous or bestial from the moment, such</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As have nor law nor king; and three of these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proud in their fantasy call themselves the Day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Morning-Star, and Noon-Sun, and Evening-Star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being strong fools; and never a whit more wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fourth, who alway rideth armed in black,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A huge man-beast of boundless savagery.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He names himself the Night and oftener Death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wears a helmet mounted with a skull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bears a skeleton figured on his arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To show that who may slay or scape the three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slain by himself, shall enter endless night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all these four be fools, but mighty men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore am I come for Lancelot.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hereat Sir Gareth called from where he rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A head with kindling eyes above the throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A boon, Sir King⁠—this quest!” then⁠—for he marked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kay near him groaning like a wounded bull⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, King, thou knowest thy kitchen-knave am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I can topple over a hundred such.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy promise, King,” and Arthur glancing at him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought down a momentary brow. “Rough, sudden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pardonable, worthy to be knight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go therefore,” and all hearers were amazed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on the damsel’s forehead shame, pride, wrath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slew the May-white: she lifted either arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fie on thee, King! I asked for thy chief knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou hast given me but a kitchen-knave.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then ere a man in hall could stay her, turned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled down the lane of access to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took horse, descended the slope street, and past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weird white gate, and paused without, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The field of tourney, murmuring “kitchen-knave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now two great entries opened from the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At one end one, that gave upon a range</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of level pavement where the King would pace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At sunrise, gazing over plain and wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down from this a lordly stairway sloped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till lost in blowing trees and tops of towers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out by this main doorway past the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one was counter to the hearth, and rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High that the highest-crested helm could ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therethrough nor graze: and by this entry fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel in her wrath, and on to this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Gareth strode, and saw without the door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Arthur’s gift, the worth of half a town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A warhorse of the best, and near it stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The two that out of north had followed him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This bare a maiden shield, a casque; that held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The horse, the spear; whereat Sir Gareth loosed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cloak that dropt from collar-bone to heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cloth of roughest web, and cast it down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from it like a fuel-smothered fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lookt half-dead, brake bright, and flashed as those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dull-coated things, that making slide apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their dusk wing-cases, all beneath there burns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A jewelled harness, ere they pass and fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Gareth ere he parted flashed in arms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then as he donned the helm, and took the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mounted horse and graspt a spear, of grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Storm-strengthened on a windy site, and tipt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With trenchant steel, around him slowly prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people, while from out of kitchen came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The thralls in throng, and seeing who had worked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lustier than any, and whom they could but love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mounted in arms, threw up their caps and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“God bless the King, and all his fellowship!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on through lanes of shouting Gareth rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the slope street, and past without the gate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Gareth past with joy; but as the cur</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pluckt from the cur he fights with, ere his cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be cooled by fighting, follows, being named,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His owner, but remembers all, and growls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering, so Sir Kay beside the door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Muttered in scorn of Gareth whom he used</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To harry and hustle.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Bound upon a quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With horse and arms⁠—the King hath past his time⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My scullion knave! Thralls to your work again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For an your fire be low ye kindle mine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will there be dawn in West and eve in East?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Begone!⁠—my knave!⁠—belike and like enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some old head-blow not heeded in his youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So shook his wits they wander in his prime⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crazed! How the villain lifted up his voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchen-knave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tut: he was tame and meek enow with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till peacocked up with Lancelot’s noticing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well⁠—I will after my loud knave, and learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether he know me for his master yet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the smoke he came, and so my lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold, by God’s grace, he shall into the mire⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence, if the King awaken from his craze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the smoke again.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But Lancelot said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Kay, wherefore wilt thou go against the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that did never he whereon ye rail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ever meekly served the King in thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abide: take counsel; for this lad is great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lusty, and knowing both of lance and sword.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Tut, tell not me,” said Kay, “ye are overfine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mar stout knaves with foolish courtesies:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then mounted, on through silent faces rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the slope city, and out beyond the gate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But by the field of tourney lingering yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Muttered the damsel, “Wherefore did the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorn me? for, were Sir Lancelot lackt, at least</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He might have yielded to me one of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who tilt for lady’s love and glory here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rather than⁠—O sweet heaven! O fie upon him⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kitchen-knave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>To whom Sir Gareth drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(And there were none but few goodlier than he)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shining in arms, “Damsel, the quest is mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead, and I follow.” She thereat, as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That smells a foul-fleshed agaric in the holt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deems it carrion of some woodland thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or shrew, or weasel, nipt her slender nose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With petulant thumb and finger, shrilling, “Hence!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Avoid, thou smellest all of kitchen-grease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And look who comes behind,” for there was Kay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Knowest thou not me? thy master? I am Kay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We lack thee by the hearth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And Gareth to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Master no more! too well I know thee, ay⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The most ungentle knight in Arthur’s hall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have at thee then,” said Kay: they shocked, and Kay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell shoulder-slipt, and Gareth cried again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lead, and I follow,” and fast away she fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But after sod and shingle ceased to fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind her, and the heart of her good horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was nigh to burst with violence of the beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perforce she stayed, and overtaken spoke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What doest thou, scullion, in my fellowship?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deem’st thou that I accept thee aught the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or love thee better, that by some device</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full cowardly, or by mere unhappiness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast overthrown and slain thy master⁠—thou!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dish-washer and broach-turner, loon!⁠—to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou smellest all of kitchen as before.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Damsel,” Sir Gareth answered gently, “say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whate’er ye will, but whatsoe’er ye say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I leave not till I finish this fair quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or die therefore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Ay, wilt thou finish it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet lord, how like a noble knight he talks!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The listening rogue hath caught the manner of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, knave, anon thou shalt be met with, knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then by such a one that thou for all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The kitchen brewis that was ever supt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shalt not once dare to look him in the face.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I shall assay,” said Gareth with a smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That maddened her, and away she flashed again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the long avenues of a boundless wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth following was again beknaved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sir Kitchen-knave, I have missed the only way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Arthur’s men are set along the wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If both be slain, I am rid of thee; but yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Scullion, canst thou use that spit of thine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fight, an thou canst: I have missed the only way.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So till the dusk that followed evensong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode on the two, reviler and reviled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then after one long slope was mounted, saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bowl-shaped, through tops of many thousand pines</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A gloomy-gladed hollow slowly sink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To westward⁠—in the deeps whereof a mere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round as the red eye of an Eagle-owl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Under the half-dead sunset glared; and shouts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascended, and there brake a servingman</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying from out of the black wood, and crying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“They have bound my lord to cast him in the mere.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Gareth, “Bound am I to right the wronged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But straitlier bound am I to bide with thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the damsel spake contemptuously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lead, and I follow,” Gareth cried again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Follow, I lead!” so down among the pines</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He plunged; and there, blackshadowed nigh the mere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mid-thigh-deep in bulrushes and reed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw six tall men haling a seventh along,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stone about his neck to drown him in it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three with good blows he quieted, but three</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled through the pines; and Gareth loosed the stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From off his neck, then in the mere beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tumbled it; oilily bubbled up the mere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Last, Gareth loosed his bonds and on free feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set him, a stalwart Baron, Arthur’s friend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well that ye came, or else these caitiff rogues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had wreaked themselves on me; good cause is theirs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hate me, for my wont hath ever been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch my thief, and then like vermin here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drown him, and with a stone about his neck;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And under this wan water many of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lie rotting, but at night let go the stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rise, and flickering in a grimly light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dance on the mere. Good now, ye have saved a life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fain would I reward thee worshipfully.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What guerdon will ye?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Gareth sharply spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“None! for the deed’s sake have I done the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In uttermost obedience to the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wilt thou yield this damsel harbourage?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereat the Baron saying, “I well believe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You be of Arthur’s Table,” a light laugh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke from Lynette, “Ay, truly of a truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in a sort, being Arthur’s kitchen-knave!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But deem not I accept thee aught the more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scullion, for running sharply with thy spit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on a rout of craven foresters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thresher with his flail had scattered them.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—for thou smellest of the kitchen still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But an this lord will yield us harbourage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So she spake. A league beyond the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a full-fair manor and a rich,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His towers where that day a feast had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held in high hall, and many a viand left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a costly cate, received the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there they placed a peacock in his pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the damsel, and the Baron set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gareth beside her, but at once she rose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Meseems, that here is much discourtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Setting this knave, Lord Baron, at my side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hear me⁠—this morn I stood in Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And prayed the King would grant me Lancelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fight the brotherhood of Day and Night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last a monster unsubduable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of any save of him for whom I called⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly bawls this frontless kitchen-knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘The quest is mine; thy kitchen-knave am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Arthur all at once gone mad replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Go therefore,’ and so gives the quest to him⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him⁠—here⁠—a villain fitter to stick swine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than ride abroad redressing women’s wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sit beside a noble gentlewoman.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then half-ashamed and part-amazed, the lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now looked at one and now at other, left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel by the peacock in his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, seating Gareth at another board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat down beside him, ate and then began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Friend, whether thou be kitchen-knave, or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether it be the maiden’s fantasy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whether she be mad, or else the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or both or neither, or thyself be mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ask not: but thou strikest a strong stroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For strong thou art and goodly therewithal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saver of my life; and therefore now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here be mighty men to joust with, weigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether thou wilt not with thy damsel back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crave again Sir Lancelot of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy pardon; I but speak for thine avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saver of my life.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And Gareth said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Full pardon, but I follow up the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Despite of Day and Night and Death and Hell.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So when, next morn, the lord whose life he saved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had, some brief space, conveyed them on their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left them with God-speed, Sir Gareth spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lead, and I follow.” Haughtily she replied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fly no more: I allow thee for an hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lion and stout have isled together, knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In time of flood. Nay, furthermore, methinks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some ruth is mine for thee. Back wilt thou, fool?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hard by here is one will overthrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay thee: then will I to court again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shame the King for only yielding me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My champion from the ashes of his hearth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom Sir Gareth answered courteously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Say thou thy say, and I will do my deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allow me for mine hour, and thou wilt find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My fortunes all as fair as hers who lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the ashes and wedded the King’s son.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to the shore of one of those long loops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherethrough the serpent river coiled, they came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rough-thicketed were the banks and steep; the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full, narrow; this a bridge of single arc</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took at a leap; and on the further side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arose a silk pavilion, gay with gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In streaks and rays, and all Lent-lily in hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that the dome was purple, and above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crimson, a slender banneret fluttering.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therebefore the lawless warrior paced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unarmed, and calling, “Damsel, is this he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The champion thou hast brought from Arthur’s hall?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom we let thee pass.” “Nay, nay,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir Morning-Star. The King in utter scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thee and thy much folly hath sent thee here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kitchen-knave: and look thou to thyself:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>See that he fall not on thee suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay thee unarmed: he is not knight but knave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then at his call, “O daughters of the Dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And servants of the Morning-Star, approach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arm me,” from out the silken curtain-folds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare-footed and bare-headed three fair girls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In gilt and rosy raiment came: their feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dewy grasses glistened; and the hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All over glanced with dewdrop or with gem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sparkles in the stone Avanturine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These armed him in blue arms, and gave a shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blue also, and thereon the morning star.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth silent gazed upon the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who stood a moment, ere his horse was brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glorying; and in the stream beneath him, shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Immingled with Heaven’s azure waveringly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gay pavilion and the naked feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His arms, the rosy raiment, and the star.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she that watched him, “Wherefore stare ye so?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shakest in thy fear: there yet is time:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flee down the valley before he get to horse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who will cry shame? Thou art not knight but knave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said Gareth, “Damsel, whether knave or knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer had I fight a score of times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hear thee so missay me and revile.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair words were best for him who fights for thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But truly foul are better, for they send</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That strength of anger through mine arms, I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I shall overthrow him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And he that bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The star, when mounted, cried from o’er the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A kitchen-knave, and sent in scorn of me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such fight not I, but answer scorn with scorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this were shame to do him further wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than set him on his feet, and take his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And arms, and so return him to the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, therefore, leave thy lady lightly, knave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Avoid: for it beseemeth not a knave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride with such a lady.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Dog, thou liest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I spring from loftier lineage than thine own.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spake; and all at fiery speed the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shocked on the central bridge, and either spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bent but not brake, and either knight at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled as a stone from out of a catapult</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond his horse’s crupper and the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell, as if dead; but quickly rose and drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth lashed so fiercely with his brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drave his enemy backward down the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel crying, “Well-stricken, kitchen-knave!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Gareth’s shield was cloven; but one stroke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid him that clove it grovelling on the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then cried the fallen, “Take not my life: I yield.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth, “So this damsel ask it of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good⁠—I accord it easily as a grace.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She reddening, “Insolent scullion: I of thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bound to thee for any favour asked!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then he shall die.” And Gareth there unlaced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His helmet as to slay him, but she shrieked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Be not so hardy, scullion, as to slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One nobler than thyself.” “Damsel, thy charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is an abounding pleasure to me. Knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy life is thine at her command. Arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And quickly pass to Arthur’s hall, and say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kitchen-knave hath sent thee. See thou crave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His pardon for thy breaking of his laws.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself, when I return, will plead for thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy shield is mine⁠—farewell; and, damsel, thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lead, and I follow.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And fast away she fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then when he came upon her, spake, “Methought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knave, when I watched thee striking on the bridge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The savour of thy kitchen came upon me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little faintlier: but the wind hath changed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I scent it twenty-fold.” And then she sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ‘O morning star’ (not that tall felon there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom thou by sorcery or unhappiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or some device, hast foully overthrown),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O morning star that smilest in the blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O star, my morning dream hath proven true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smile sweetly, thou! my love hath smiled on me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But thou begone, take counsel, and away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For hard by here is one that guards a ford⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The second brother in their fool’s parable⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will pay thee all thy wages, and to boot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Care not for shame: thou art not knight but knave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom Sir Gareth answered, laughingly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Parables? Hear a parable of the knave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I was kitchen-knave among the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fierce was the hearth, and one of my co-mates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Owned a rough dog, to whom he cast his coat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Guard it,’ and there was none to meddle with it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such a coat art thou, and thee the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave me to guard, and such a dog am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To worry, and not to flee⁠—and⁠—knight or knave⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The knave that doth thee service as full knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all as good, meseems, as any knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward thy sister’s freeing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Ay, Sir Knave!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, knave, because thou strikest as a knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being but knave, I hate thee all the more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair damsel, you should worship me the more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, being but knave, I throw thine enemies.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay, ay,” she said, “but thou shalt meet thy match.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So when they touched the second river-loop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Huge on a huge red horse, and all in mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burnished to blinding, shone the Noonday Sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond a raging shallow. As if the flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That blows a globe of after arrowlets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ten thousand-fold had grown, flashed the fierce shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All sun; and Gareth’s eyes had flying blots</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before them when he turned from watching him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He from beyond the roaring shallow roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What doest thou, brother, in my marches here?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she athwart the shallow shrilled again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Here is a kitchen-knave from Arthur’s hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath overthrown thy brother, and hath his arms.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ugh!” cried the Sun, and vizoring up a red</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cipher face of rounded foolishness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pushed horse across the foamings of the ford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Gareth met midstream: no room was there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For lance or tourney-skill: four strokes they struck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sword, and these were mighty; the new knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had fear he might be shamed; but as the Sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heaved up a ponderous arm to strike the fifth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hoof of his horse slipt in the stream, the stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descended, and the Sun was washed away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Gareth laid his lance athwart the ford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So drew him home; but he that fought no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As being all bone-battered on the rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yielded; and Gareth sent him to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Myself when I return will plead for thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lead, and I follow.” Quietly she led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hath not the good wind, damsel, changed again?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, not a point: nor art thou victor here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There lies a ridge of slate across the ford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horse thereon stumbled⁠—ay, for I saw it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O Sun’ (not this strong fool whom thou, Sir Knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast overthrown through mere unhappiness),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O Sun, that wakenest all to bliss or pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O moon, that layest all to sleep again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine sweetly: twice my love hath smiled on me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What knowest thou of lovesong or of love?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, nay, God wot, so thou wert nobly born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast a pleasant presence. Yea, perchance⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O dewy flowers that open to the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O dewy flowers that close when day is done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow sweetly: twice my love hath smiled on me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What knowest thou of flowers, except, belike,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To garnish meats with? hath not our good King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lent me thee, the flower of kitchendom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A foolish love for flowers? what stick ye round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pasty? wherewithal deck the boar’s head?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowers? nay, the boar hath rosemaries and bay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O birds, that warble to the morning sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O birds that warble as the day goes by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing sweetly: twice my love hath smiled on me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What knowest thou of birds, lark, mavis, merle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Linnet? what dream ye when they utter forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May-music growing with the growing light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their sweet sun-worship? these be for the snare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(So runs thy fancy) these be for the spit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Larding and basting. See thou have not now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Larded thy last, except thou turn and fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stands the third fool of their allegory.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For there beyond a bridge of treble bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a rose-red from the west, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naked it seemed, and glowing in the broad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep-dimpled current underneath, the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That named himself the Star of Evening, stood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth, “Wherefore waits the madman there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naked in open dayshine?” “Nay,” she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not naked, only wrapt in hardened skins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fit him like his own; and so ye cleave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His armour off him, these will turn the blade.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the third brother shouted o’er the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O brother-star, why shine ye here so low?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy ward is higher up: but have ye slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel’s champion?” and the damsel cried,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No star of thine, but shot from Arthur’s heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all disaster unto thine and thee!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For both thy younger brethren have gone down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before this youth; and so wilt thou, Sir Star;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou not old?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Old, damsel, old and hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old, with the might and breath of twenty boys.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Gareth, “Old, and over-bold in brag!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that same strength which threw the Morning Star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can throw the Evening.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then that other blew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hard and deadly note upon the horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Approach and arm me!” With slow steps from out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An old storm-beaten, russet, many-stained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pavilion, forth a grizzled damsel came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armed him in old arms, and brought a helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With but a drying evergreen for crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave a shield whereon the Star of Even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-tarnished and half-bright, his emblem, shone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when it glittered o’er the saddle-bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They madly hurled together on the bridge;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth overthrew him, lighted, drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There met him drawn, and overthrew him again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But up like fire he started: and as oft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Gareth brought him grovelling on his knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many a time he vaulted up again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Gareth panted hard, and his great heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foredooming all his trouble was in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laboured within him, for he seemed as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all in later, sadder age begins</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To war against ill uses of a life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But these from all his life arise, and cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou hast made us lords, and canst not put us down!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He half despairs; so Gareth seemed to strike</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vainly, the damsel clamouring all the while,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well done, knave-knight, well-stricken, O good knight-knave⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O knave, as noble as any of all the knights⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame me not, shame me not. I have prophesied⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike, thou art worthy of the Table Round⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His arms are old, he trusts the hardened skin⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike⁠—strike⁠—the wind will never change again.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth hearing ever stronglier smote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hewed great pieces of his armour off him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lashed in vain against the hardened skin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And could not wholly bring him under, more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than loud Southwesterns, rolling ridge on ridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The buoy that rides at sea, and dips and springs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forever; till at length Sir Gareth’s brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clashed his, and brake it utterly to the hilt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have thee now;” but forth that other sprang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, all unknightlike, writhed his wiry arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around him, till he felt, despite his mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strangled, but straining even his uttermost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast, and so hurled him headlong o’er the bridge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down to the river, sink or swim, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lead, and I follow.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But the damsel said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I lead no longer; ride thou at my side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou art the kingliest of all kitchen-knaves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O trefoil, sparkling on the rainy plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O rainbow with three colours after rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shine sweetly: thrice my love hath smiled on me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sir⁠—and, good faith, I fain had added⁠—Knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that I heard thee call thyself a knave⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shamed am I that I so rebuked, reviled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Missaid thee; noble I am; and thought the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorned me and mine; and now thy pardon, friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou hast ever answered courteously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wholly bold thou art, and meek withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As any of Arthur’s best, but, being knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hast mazed my wit: I marvel what thou art.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Damsel,” he said, “you be not all to blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saving that you mistrusted our good King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would handle scorn, or yield you, asking, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not fit to cope your quest. You said your say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine answer was my deed. Good sooth! I hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He scarce is knight, yea but half-man, nor meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fight for gentle damsel, he, who lets</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His heart be stirred with any foolish heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At any gentle damsel’s waywardness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shamed? care not! thy foul sayings fought for me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing now thy words are fair, methinks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There rides no knight, not Lancelot, his great self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath force to quell me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Nigh upon that hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the lone hern forgets his melancholy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lets down his other leg, and stretching, dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of goodly supper in the distant pool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then turned the noble damsel smiling at him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told him of a cavern hard at hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where bread and baken meats and good red wine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Southland, which the Lady Lyonors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had sent her coming champion, waited him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Anon they past a narrow comb wherein</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where slabs of rock with figures, knights on horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sculptured, and deckt in slowly-waning hues.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir Knave, my knight, a hermit once was here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose holy hand hath fashioned on the rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The war of Time against the soul of man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yon four fools have sucked their allegory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From these damp walls, and taken but the form.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know ye not these?” and Gareth lookt and read⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In letters like to those the vexillary</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath left crag-carven o’er the streaming Gelt⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“<b>Phosphorus</b>,” then “<b>Meridies</b>”⁠—“<b>Hesperus</b>”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“<b>Nox</b>”⁠—“<b>Mors</b>,” beneath five figures, armed men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slab after slab, their faces forward all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And running down the Soul, a Shape that fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With broken wings, torn raiment and loose hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For help and shelter to the hermit’s cave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Follow the faces, and we find it. Look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who comes behind?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>For one⁠—delayed at first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through helping back the dislocated Kay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Camelot, then by what thereafter chanced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The damsel’s headlong error through the wood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot, having swum the river-loops⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His blue shield-lions covered⁠—softly drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind the twain, and when he saw the star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gleam, on Sir Gareth’s turning to him, cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stay, felon knight, I avenge me for my friend.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth crying pricked against the cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when they closed⁠—in a moment⁠—at one touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that skilled spear, the wonder of the world⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went sliding down so easily, and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when he found the grass within his hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laughed; the laughter jarred upon Lynette:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harshly she asked him, “Shamed and overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tumbled back into the kitchen-knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why laugh ye? that ye blew your boast in vain?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, noble damsel, but that I, the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And victor of the bridges and the ford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knight of Arthur, here lie thrown by whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not, all through mere unhappiness⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Device and sorcery and unhappiness⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out, sword; we are thrown!” And Lancelot answered, “Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Gareth⁠—through the mere unhappiness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one who came to help thee, not to harm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, and all as glad to find thee whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As on the day when Arthur knighted him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Gareth, “Thou⁠—Lancelot!⁠—thine the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That threw me? An some chance to mar the boast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy brethren of thee make⁠—which could not chance⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had sent thee down before a lesser spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shamed had I been, and sad⁠—O Lancelot⁠—thou!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereat the maiden, petulant, “Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why came ye not, when called? and wherefore now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come ye, not called? I gloried in my knave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who being still rebuked, would answer still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courteous as any knight⁠—but now, if knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marvel dies, and leaves me fooled and tricked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only wondering wherefore played upon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doubtful whether I and mine be scorned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where should be truth if not in Arthur’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s presence? Knight, knave, prince and fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hate thee and forever.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And Lancelot said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Blessed be thou, Sir Gareth! knight art thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the King’s best wish. O damsel, be you wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To call him shamed, who is but overthrown?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrown have I been, nor once, but many a time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Victor from vanquished issues at the last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overthrower from being overthrown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sword we have not striven; and thy good horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou are weary; yet not less I felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy manhood through that wearied lance of thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well hast thou done; for all the stream is freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou hast wreaked his justice on his foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when reviled, hast answered graciously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makest merry when overthrown. Prince, Knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail, Knight and Prince, and of our Table Round!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then when turning to Lynette he told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tale of Gareth, petulantly she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay well⁠—ay well⁠—for worse than being fooled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of others, is to fool one’s self. A cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot, is hard by, with meats and drinks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forage for the horse, and flint for fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But all about it flies a honeysuckle.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seek, till we find.” And when they sought and found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Gareth drank and ate, and all his life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past into sleep; on whom the maiden gazed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sound sleep be thine! sound cause to sleep hast thou.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wake lusty! Seem I not as tender to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As any mother? Ay, but such a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As all day long hath rated at her child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vext his day, but blesses him asleep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good lord, how sweetly smells the honeysuckle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the hushed night, as if the world were one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of utter peace, and love, and gentleness!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Lancelot, Lancelot”⁠—and she clapt her hands⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Full merry am I to find my goodly knave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is knight and noble. See now, sworn have I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else yon black felon had not let me pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bring thee back to do the battle with him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus an thou goest, he will fight thee first;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who doubts thee victor? so will my knight-knave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miss the full flower of this accomplishment.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said Lancelot, “Peradventure he, you name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May know my shield. Let Gareth, an he will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Change his for mine, and take my charger, fresh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be spurred, loving the battle as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he that rides him.” “Lancelot-like,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Courteous in this, Lord Lancelot, as in all.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gareth, wakening, fiercely clutched the shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ramp ye lance-splintering lions, on whom all spears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are rotten sticks! ye seem agape to roar!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, ramp and roar at leaving of your lord!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Care not, good beasts, so well I care for you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O noble Lancelot, from my hold on these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streams virtue⁠—fire⁠—through one that will not shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even the shadow of Lancelot under shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence: let us go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Silent the silent field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They traversed. Arthur’s harp though summer-wan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In counter motion to the clouds, allured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glance of Gareth dreaming on his liege.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A star shot: “Lo,” said Gareth, “the foe falls!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An owl whoopt: “Hark the victor pealing there!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly she that rode upon his left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yield, yield him this again: ’tis he must fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I curse the tongue that all through yesterday</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lend thee horse and shield: wonders ye have done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Miracles ye cannot: here is glory enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In having flung the three: I see thee maimed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mangled: I swear thou canst not fling the fourth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And wherefore, damsel? tell me all ye know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You cannot scare me; nor rough face, or voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brute bulk of limb, or boundless savagery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appal me from the quest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Nay, Prince,” she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“God wot, I never looked upon the face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing he never rides abroad by day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But watched him have I like a phantom pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chilling the night: nor have I heard the voice.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always he made his mouthpiece of a page</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who came and went, and still reported him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As closing in himself the strength of ten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when his anger tare him, massacring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man, woman, lad and girl⁠—yea, the soft babe!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some hold that he hath swallowed infant flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Monster! O Prince, I went for Lancelot first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quest is Lancelot’s: give him back the shield.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Said Gareth laughing, “An he fight for this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belike he wins it as the better man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus⁠—and not else!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But Lancelot on him urged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the devisings of their chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When one might meet a mightier than himself;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How best to manage horse, lance, sword and shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so fill up the gap where force might fail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With skill and fineness. Instant were his words.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Gareth, “Here be rules. I know but one⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dash against mine enemy and win.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet have I seen thee victor in the joust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seen thy way.” “Heaven help thee,” sighed Lynette.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then for a space, and under cloud that grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To thunder-gloom palling all stars, they rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In converse till she made her palfrey halt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted an arm, and softly whispered, “There.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the three were silent seeing, pitched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the Castle Perilous on flat field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A huge pavilion like a mountain peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sunder the glooming crimson on the marge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Black, with black banner, and a long black horn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside it hanging; which Sir Gareth graspt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so, before the two could hinder him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent all his heart and breath through all the horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Echoed the walls; a light twinkled; anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came lights and lights, and once again he blew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon were hollow tramplings up and down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And muffled voices heard, and shadows past;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till high above him, circled with her maids,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lady Lyonors at a window stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful among lights, and waving to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White hands, and courtesy; but when the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times had blown⁠—after long hush⁠—at last⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The huge pavilion slowly yielded up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through those black foldings, that which housed therein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on a night-black horse, in night-black arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With white breast-bone, and barren ribs of Death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crowned with fleshless laughter⁠—some ten steps⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the half-light⁠—through the dim dawn⁠—advanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monster, and then paused, and spake no word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Gareth spake and all indignantly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fool, for thou hast, men say, the strength of ten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Canst thou not trust the limbs thy God hath given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But must, to make the terror of thee more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trick thyself out in ghastly imageries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that which Life hath done with, and the clod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less dull than thou, will hide with mantling flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if for pity?” But he spake no word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which set the horror higher: a maiden swooned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lady Lyonors wrung her hands and wept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As doomed to be the bride of Night and Death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Gareth’s head prickled beneath his helm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even Sir Lancelot through his warm blood felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ice strike, and all that marked him were aghast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At once Sir Lancelot’s charger fiercely neighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Death’s dark warhorse bounded forward with him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then those that did not blink the terror, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Death was cast to ground, and slowly rose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But with one stroke Sir Gareth split the skull.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half fell to right and half to left and lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As throughly as the skull; and out from this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Issued the bright face of a blooming boy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh as a flower new-born, and crying, “Knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slay me not: my three brethren bad me do it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make a horror all about the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stay the world from Lady Lyonors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never dreamed the passes would be past.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Answered Sir Gareth graciously to one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not many a moon his younger, “My fair child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What madness made thee challenge the chief knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur’s hall?” “Fair Sir, they bad me do it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hate the King, and Lancelot, the King’s friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hoped to slay him somewhere on the stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They never dreamed the passes could be past.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then sprang the happier day from underground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lady Lyonors and her house, with dance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And revel and song, made merry over Death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As being after all their foolish fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And horrors only proven a blooming boy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So large mirth lived and Gareth won the quest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he that told the tale in older times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, that told it later, says Lynette.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Geraint and Enid</h2>
			<p>
				<span>O purblind race of miserable men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How many among us at this very hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By taking true for false, or false for true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, through the feeble twilight of this world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Groping, how many, until we pass and reach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That other, where we see as we are seen!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So fared it with Geraint, who issuing forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That morning, when they both had got to horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps because he loved her passionately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt that tempest brooding round his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, if he spoke at all, would break perforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a head so dear in thunder, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not at my side. I charge thee ride before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever a good way on before; and this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge thee, on thy duty as a wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whatever happens, not to speak to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No, not a word!” and Enid was aghast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth they rode, but scarce three paces on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When crying out, “Effeminate as I am,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not fight my way with gilded arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All shall be iron;” he loosed a mighty purse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung at his belt, and hurled it toward the squire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the last sight that Enid had of home</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was all the marble threshold flashing, strown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With gold and scattered coinage, and the squire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chafing his shoulder: then he cried again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To the wilds!” and Enid leading down the tracks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through which he bad her lead him on, they past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marches, and by bandit-haunted holds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gray swamps and pools, waste places of the hern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wildernesses, perilous paths, they rode:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round was their pace at first, but slackened soon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stranger meeting them had surely thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They rode so slowly and they looked so pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That each had suffered some exceeding wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he was ever saying to himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O I that wasted time to tend upon her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To compass her with sweet observances,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dress her beautifully and keep her true”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he broke the sentence in his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abruptly, as a man upon his tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May break it, when his passion masters him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she was ever praying the sweet heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save her dear lord whole from any wound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever in her mind she cast about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that unnoticed failing in herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which made him look so cloudy and so cold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the great plover’s human whistle amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her heart, and glancing round the waste she feared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In ever wavering brake an ambuscade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thought again, “If there be such in me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might amend it by the grace of Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If he would only speak and tell me of it.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the fourth part of the day was gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Enid was aware of three tall knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On horseback, wholly armed, behind a rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In shadow, waiting for them, caitiffs all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard one crying to his fellow, “Look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here comes a laggard hanging down his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who seems no bolder than a beaten hound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, we will slay him and will have his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armour, and his damsel shall be ours.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Enid pondered in her heart, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will go back a little to my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will tell him all their caitiff talk;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, be he wroth even to slaying me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer by his dear hand had I die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that my lord should suffer loss or shame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she went back some paces of return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Met his full frown timidly firm, and said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord, I saw three bandits by the rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting to fall on you, and heard them boast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they would slay you, and possess your horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armour, and your damsel should be theirs.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He made a wrathful answer: “Did I wish</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your warning or your silence? one command</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I laid upon you, not to speak to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus ye keep it! Well then, look⁠—for now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether ye wish me victory or defeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long for my life, or hunger for my death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yourself shall see my vigour is not lost.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Enid waited pale and sorrowful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down upon him bare the bandit three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the midmost charging, Prince Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drave the long spear a cubit through his breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out beyond; and then against his brace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of comrades, each of whom had broken on him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lance that splintered like an icicle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung from his brand a windy buffet out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once, twice, to right, to left, and stunned the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or slew them, and dismounting like a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That skins the wild beast after slaying him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stript from the three dead wolves of woman born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The three gay suits of armour which they wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the bodies lie, but bound the suits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of armour on their horses, each on each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tied the bridle-reins of all the three</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, and said to her, “Drive them on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before you;” and she drove them through the waste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He followed nearer; ruth began to work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against his anger in him, while he watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The being he loved best in all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With difficulty in mild obedience</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Driving them on: he fain had spoken to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And smouldered wrong that burnt him all within;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But evermore it seemed an easier thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once without remorse to strike her dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to cry “Halt,” and to her own bright face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accuse her of the least immodesty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus tongue-tied, it made him wroth the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she could speak whom his own ear had heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call herself false: and suffering thus he made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Minutes an age: but in scarce longer time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than at Caerleon the full-tided Usk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before he turn to fall seaward again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pauses, did Enid, keeping watch, behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the first shallow shade of a deep wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a gloom of stubborn-shafted oaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three other horsemen waiting, wholly armed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof one seemed far larger than her lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook her pulses, crying, “Look, a prize!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three horses and three goodly suits of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all in charge of whom? a girl: set on.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay,” said the second, “yonder comes a knight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The third, “A craven; how he hangs his head.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The giant answered merrily, “Yea, but one?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wait here, and when he passes fall upon him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid pondered in her heart and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will abide the coming of my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will tell him all their villainy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lord is weary with the fight before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they will fall upon him unawares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I needs must disobey him for his good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How should I dare obey him to his harm?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs must I speak, and though he kill me for it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I save a life dearer to me than mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she abode his coming, and said to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With timid firmness, “Have I leave to speak?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He said, “Ye take it, speaking,” and she spoke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There lurk three villains yonder in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each of them is wholly armed, and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is larger-limbed than you are, and they say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That they will fall upon you while ye pass.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To which he flung a wrathful answer back:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And if there were an hundred in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every man were larger-limbed than I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all at once should sally out upon me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swear it would not ruffle me so much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As you that not obey me. Stand aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I fall, cleave to the better man.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid stood aside to wait the event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not dare to watch the combat, only breathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Short fits of prayer, at every stroke a breath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he, she dreaded most, bare down upon him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aimed at the helm, his lance erred; but Geraint’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little in the late encounter strained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck through the bulky bandit’s corselet home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then brake short, and down his enemy rolled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there lay still; as he that tells the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saw once a great piece of a promontory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That had a sapling growing on it, slide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the long shore-cliff’s windy walls to the beach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there lie still, and yet the sapling grew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So lay the man transfixt. His craven pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of comrades making slowlier at the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When now they saw their bulwark fallen, stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On whom the victor, to confound them more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spurred with his terrible war-cry; for as one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That listens near a torrent mountain-brook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All through the crash of the near cataract hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The drumming thunder of the huger fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At distance, were the soldiers wont to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His voice in battle, and be kindled by it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And foemen scared, like that false pair who turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, but, overtaken, died the death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Themselves had wrought on many an innocent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon Geraint, dismounting, picked the lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That pleased him best, and drew from those dead wolves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their three gay suits of armour, each from each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bound them on their horses, each on each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tied the bridle-reins of all the three</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, and said to her, “Drive them on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before you,” and she drove them through the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He followed nearer still: the pain she had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep them in the wild ways of the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two sets of three laden with jingling arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, served a little to disedge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sharpness of that pain about her heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they themselves, like creatures gently born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But into bad hands fallen, and now so long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By bandits groomed, pricked their light ears, and felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her low firm voice and tender government.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So through the green gloom of the wood they past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And issuing under open heavens beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little town with towers, upon a rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close beneath, a meadow gemlike chased</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the brown wild, and mowers mowing in it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down a rocky pathway from the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a fair-haired youth, that in his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare victual for the mowers: and Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had ruth again on Enid looking pale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, moving downward to the meadow ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, when the fair-haired youth came by him, said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Friend, let her eat; the damsel is so faint.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, willingly,” replied the youth; “and thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My lord, eat also, though the fare is coarse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only meet for mowers;” then set down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His basket, and dismounting on the sward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They let the horses graze, and ate themselves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid took a little delicately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less having stomach for it than desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To close with her lord’s pleasure; but Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ate all the mowers’ victual unawares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when he found all empty, was amazed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “Boy,” said he, “I have eaten all, but take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horse and arms for guerdon; choose the best.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, reddening in extremity of delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord, you overpay me fifty-fold.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye will be all the wealthier,” cried the Prince.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I take it as free gift, then,” said the boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not guerdon; for myself can easily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While your good damsel rests, return, and fetch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh victual for these mowers of our Earl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these are his, and all the field is his,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I myself am his; and I will tell him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How great a man thou art: he loves to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When men of mark are in his territory:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he will have thee to his palace here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And serve thee costlier than with mowers’ fare.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said Geraint, “I wish no better fare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never ate with angrier appetite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than when I left your mowers dinnerless.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into no Earl’s palace will I go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know, God knows, too much of palaces!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he want me, let him come to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hire us some fair chamber for the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stalling for the horses, and return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With victual for these men, and let us know.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea, my kind lord,” said the glad youth, and went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held his head high, and thought himself a knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up the rocky pathway disappeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leading the horse, and they were left alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the Prince had brought his errant eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Home from the rock, sideways he let them glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Enid, where she droopt: his own false doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shadow of mistrust should never cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt them, came upon him, and he sighed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with another humorous ruth remarked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lusty mowers labouring dinnerless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after nodded sleepily in the heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she, remembering her old ruined hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the windy clamour of the daws</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About her hollow turret, plucked the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There growing longest by the meadow’s edge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into many a listless annulet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now over, now beneath her marriage ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wove and unwove it, till the boy returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told them of a chamber, and they went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, after saying to her, “If ye will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call for the woman of the house,” to which</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “Thanks, my lord;” the two remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Apart by all the chamber’s width, and mute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or two wild men supporters of a shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Painted, who stare at open space, nor glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one at other, parted by the shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On a sudden, many a voice along the street,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heel against the pavement echoing, burst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their drowse; and either started while the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pushed from without, drave backward to the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And midmost of a rout of roisterers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Femininely fair and dissolutely pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her suitor in old years before Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Entered, the wild lord of the place, Limours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He moving up with pliant courtliness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Greeted Geraint full face, but stealthily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mid-warmth of welcome and graspt hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found Enid with the corner of his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew her sitting sad and solitary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then cried Geraint for wine and goodly cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feed the sudden guest, and sumptuously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to his fashion, bad the host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call in what men soever were his friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feast with these in honour of their Earl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And care not for the cost; the cost is mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And wine and food were brought, and Earl Limours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drank till he jested with all ease, and told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free tales, and took the word and played upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made it of two colours; for his talk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When wine and free companions kindled him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of fifty facets; thus he moved the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To laughter and his comrades to applause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when the Prince was merry, asked Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your leave, my lord, to cross the room, and speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To your good damsel there who sits apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seems so lonely?” “My free leave,” he said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Get her to speak: she doth not speak to me.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid, my early and my only love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What chance is this? how is it I see you here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet fear me not: I call mine own self wild,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But keep a touch of sweet civility</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought, but that your father came between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In former days you saw me favourably.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if it were so do not keep it back:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make me a little happier: let me know it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You come with no attendance, page or maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve you⁠—doth he love you as of old?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, call it lovers’ quarrels, yet I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though men may bicker with the things they love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would not make them laughable in all eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your story, that this man loves you no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your beauty is no beauty to him now:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A common chance⁠—right well I know it⁠—palled⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I know men: nor will ye win him back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the man’s love once gone never returns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here is one who loves you as of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With more exceeding passion than of old:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good, speak the word: my followers ring him round:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They understand: nay; I do not mean blood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My malice is no deeper than a moat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No stronger than a wall: there is the keep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one true lover whom you ever owned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will make use of all the power I have.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O pardon me! the madness of that hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this the tender sound of his own voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered with such craft as women use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That breaks upon them perilously, and said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Earl, if you love me as in former years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And do not practise on me, come with morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snatch me from him as by violence;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leave me tonight: I am weary to the death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the stout Prince bad him a loud goodnight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He moving homeward babbled to his men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How Enid never loved a man but him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Debating his command of silence given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that she now perforce must violate it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held commune with herself, and while she held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wake him, but hung o’er him, wholly pleased</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find him yet unwounded after fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hear him breathing low and equally.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pieces of his armour in one place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All to be there against a sudden need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By that day’s grief and travel, evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went slipping down horrible precipices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all his rout of random followers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was the red cock shouting to the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the gray dawn stole o’er the dewy world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glimmered on his armour in the room.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once again she rose to look at it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But touched it unawares: jangling, the casque</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell, and he started up and stared at her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then breaking his command of silence given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She told him all that Earl Limours had said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the passage that he loved her not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor left untold the craft herself had used;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ended with apology so sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So justified by that necessity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That though he thought “was it for him she wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Devon?” he but gave a wrathful groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “Your sweet faces make good fellows fools</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And traitors. Call the host and bid him bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charger and palfrey.” So she glided out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the heavy breathings of the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a household Spirit at the walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence, did him service as a squire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thy reckoning, friend?” and ere he learnt it, “Take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five horses and their armours;” and the host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye will be all the wealthier,” said the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then to Enid, “Forward! and today</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge you, Enid, more especially,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thing soever ye may hear, or see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or fancy (though I count it of small use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid answered, “Yea, my lord, I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the violent threats you do not hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see the danger which you cannot see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost beyond me: yet I would obey.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea so,” said he, “do it: be not too wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all mismated with a yawning clown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one with arms to guard his head and yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With eyes to find you out however far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ears to hear you even in his dreams.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With that he turned and looked as keenly at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As careful robins eye the delver’s toil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that within her, which a wanton fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led from the territory of false Limours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the waste earldom of another earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went Enid with her sullen follower on.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More near by many a rood than yestermorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waving an angry hand as who should say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye watch me,” saddened all her heart again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then not to disobey her lord’s behest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet to give him warning, for he rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if he heard not, moving back she held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At which the warrior in his obstinacy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because she kept the letter of his word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the moment after, wild Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down by the length of lance and arm beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overthrew the next that followed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the flash and motion of the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of darting fish, that on a summer morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come slipping o’er their shadows on the sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if a man who stands upon the brink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lift a shining hand against the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is not left the twinkle of a fin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, scared but at the motion of the man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left him lying in the public way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So vanish friendships only made in wine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who saw the chargers of the two that fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mixt with the flyers. “Horse and man,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All of one mind and all right-honest friends!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not a hoof left: and I methinks till now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was honest⁠—paid with horses and with arms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so what say ye, shall we strip him there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No?⁠—then do thou, being right honest, pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I too would still be honest.” Thus he said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answering not one word, she led the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But as a man to whom a dreadful loss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls in a far land and he knows it not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But coming back he learns it, and the loss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In combat with the follower of Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bled underneath his armour secretly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at a sudden swerving of the road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though happily down on a bank of grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly came, and at his side all pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tearing off her veil of faded silk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord’s life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then after all was done that hand could do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She rested, and her desolation came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon her, and she wept beside the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And many past, but none regarded her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For in that realm of lawless turbulence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman weeping for her murdered mate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was cared as much for as a summer shower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before an ever-fancied arrow, made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scoured into the coppices and was lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came riding with a hundred lances up;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried out with a big voice, “What, is he dead?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No, no, not dead!” she answered in all haste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Would some of your people take him up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said Earl Doorm: “Well, if he be not dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be he dead, I count you for a fool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your wailing will not quicken him: dead or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, since the face is comely⁠—some of you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An if he live, we will have him of our band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he die, why earth has earth enough</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hide him. See ye take the charger too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A noble one.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>He spake, and past away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each growling like a dog, when his good bone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seems to be plucked at by the village boys</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love to vex him eating, and he fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gnawing and growling: so the ruffians growled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their chance of booty from the morning’s raid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as they brought upon their forays out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For those that might be wounded; laid him on it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in the hollow of his shield, and took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(His gentle charger following him unled)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast him and the bier in which he lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on an oaken settle in the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then departed, hot in haste to join</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their luckier mates, but growling as before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might as well have blest her: she was deaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blessing or to cursing save from one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in the naked hall, propping his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found his own dear bride propping his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt the warm tears falling on his face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said to his own heart, “She weeps for me:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might prove her to the uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And say to his own heart, “She weeps for me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But in the falling afternoon returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each hurling down a heap of things that rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doffed his helm: and then there fluttered in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mingled with the spearmen: and Earl Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck with a knife’s haft hard against the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none spake word, but all sat down at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ate with tumult in the naked hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Enid shrank far back into herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A damsel drooping in a corner of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then he remembered her, and how she wept;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of her there came a power upon him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rising on the sudden he said, “Eat!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never yet beheld a thing so pale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God’s curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat! Look yourself. Good luck had your good man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For were I dead who is it would weep for me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have I beheld a lily like yourself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so there lived some colour in your cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is not one among my gentlewomen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But listen to me, and by me be ruled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will do the thing I have not done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we will live like two birds in one nest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will fetch you forage from all fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I compel all creatures to my will.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke: the brawny spearman let his cheek</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes it earth, hissed each at other’s ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What shall not be recorded⁠—women they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Women, or what had been those gracious things,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now desired the humbling of their best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, would have helped him to it: and all at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hated her, who took no thought of them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But answered in low voice, her meek head yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drooping, “I pray you of your courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He being as he is, to let me be.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a mighty patron, satisfied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With what himself had done so graciously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, “Yea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She answered meekly, “How should I be glad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth in all the world at anything,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until my lord arise and look upon me?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As all but empty heart and weariness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bare her by main violence to the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrust the dish before her, crying, “Eat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No, no,” said Enid, vext, “I will not eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till yonder man upon the bier arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eat with me.” “Drink, then,” he answered. “Here!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>God’s curse, with anger⁠—often I myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not so,” she cried, “by Heaven, I will not drink</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drink with me; and if he rise no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not look at wine until I die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this he turned all red and paced his hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And coming up close to her, said at last:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take warning: yonder man is surely dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I compel all creatures to my will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not eat nor drink? And wherefore wail for one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By dressing it in rags? Amazed am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholding how ye butt against my wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I forbear you thus: cross me no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At least put off to please me this poor gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This silken rag, this beggar-woman’s weed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I love that beauty should go beautifully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For see ye not my gentlewomen here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How gay, how suited to the house of one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise therefore; robe yourself in this: obey.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Played into green, and thicker down the front</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with the dawn ascending lets the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike where it clung: so thickly shone the gems.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Enid answered, harder to be moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With life-long injuries burning unavenged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now their hour has come; and Enid said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved me serving in my father’s hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this poor gown I rode with him to court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When now we rode upon this fatal quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of honour, where no honour can be gained:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this poor gown I will not cast aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until himself arise a living man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bid me cast it. I have griefs enough:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never loved, can never love but him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He being as he is, to let me be.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took his russet beard between his teeth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying, “I count it of no more avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take my salute,” unknightly with flat hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However lightly, smote her on the cheek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since she thought, “He had not dared to do it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except he surely knew my lord was dead,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a wild thing taken in the trap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(It lay beside him in the hollow shield),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the men and women in the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yelling as from a spectre, and the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were left alone together, and he said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Done you more wrong: we both have undergone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That trouble which has left me thrice your own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here I lay this penance on myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard you say, that you were no true wife:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I do believe yourself against yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And will henceforward rather die than doubt.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid could not say one tender word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She only prayed him, “Fly, they will return</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slay you; fly, your charger is without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My palfrey lost.” “Then, Enid, shall you ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind me.” “Yea,” said Enid, “let us go.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moving out they found the stately horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now no more a vassal to the thief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a low whinny toward the pair: and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kissed the white star upon his noble front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She set her own and climbed; he turned his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About him, and at once they rode away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And never yet, since high in Paradise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er the four rivers the first roses blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put hand to hand beneath her husband’s heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt him hers again: she did not weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But o’er her meek eyes came a happy mist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like that which kept the heart of Eden green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the useful trouble of the rain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As not to see before them on the path,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knight of Arthur’s court, who laid his lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrieked to the stranger “Slay not a dead man!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The voice of Enid,” said the knight; but she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love you, Prince, with something of the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For once, when I was up so high in pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By overthrowing me you threw me higher.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now, made a knight of Arthur’s Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since I knew this Earl, when I myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(The King is close behind me) bidding him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He hears the judgment of the King of kings,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried the wan Prince; “and lo, the powers of Doorm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are scattered,” and he pointed to the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were men and women staring and aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the knight besought him, “Follow me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prince, to the camp, and in the King’s own ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange chances here alone;” that other flushed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hung his head, and halted in reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after madness acted question asked:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Edyrn crying, “If ye will not go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Enough,” he said, “I follow,” and they went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Enid in their going had two fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One from the bandit scattered in the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one from Edyrn. Every now and then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shrank a little. In a hollow land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which old fires have broken, men may fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fresh fire and ruin. He, perceiving, said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yourself were first the blameless cause to make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My nature’s prideful sparkle in the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Break into furious flame; being repulsed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until I overturned him; then set up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(With one main purpose ever at my heart)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, toppling over all antagonism,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So waxed in pride, that I believed myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should have slain your father, seized yourself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I lived in hope that sometime you would come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these my lists with him whom best you loved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold me overturn and trample on him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should not less have killed him. And so you came⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But once you came⁠—and with your own true eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks of a service done him) overthrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My proud self, and my purpose three years old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set his foot upon me, and give me life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was I broken down; there was I saved:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the penance the Queen laid upon me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was but to rest awhile within her court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waiting to be treated like a wolf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such fine reserve and noble reticence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of tenderest courtesy, that I began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To glance behind me at my former life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find that it had been the wolf’s indeed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you were often there about the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept myself aloof till I was changed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and Enid easily believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like simple noble natures, credulous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There most in those who most have done them ill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they reached the camp the King himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Advanced to greet them, and beholding her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In converse for a little, and returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed an empty tent allotted her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glancing for a minute, till he saw her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To move to your own land, and there defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By having looked too much through alien eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wrought too long with delegated hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not used mine own: but now behold me come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Edyrn and with others: have ye looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This work of his is great and wonderful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His very face with change of heart is changed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world will not believe a man repents:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this wise world of ours is mainly right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full seldom doth a man repent, or use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of blood and custom wholly out of him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I will weed this land before I go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rashly, but have proved him everyway</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of our noblest, our most valorous,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sanest and most obedient: and indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After a life of violence, seems to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand-fold more great and wonderful</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My subject with my subjects under him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should make an onslaught single on a realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were himself nigh wounded to the death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His work was neither great nor wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past to Enid’s tent; and thither came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King’s own leech to look into his hurt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid tended on him there; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her constant motion round him, and the breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Filled all the genial courses of his blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With deeper and with ever deeper love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the south-west that blowing Bala lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills all the sacred Dee. So past the days.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But while Geraint lay healing of his hurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blameless King went forth and cast his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On each of all whom Uther left in charge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long since, to guard the justice of the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked and found them wanting; and as now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men weed the white horse on the Berkshire hills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep him bright and clean as heretofore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rooted out the slothful officer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or guilty, which for bribe had winked at wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in their chairs set up a stronger race</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hearts and hands, and sent a thousand men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To till the wastes, and moving everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cleared the dark places and let in the law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, when Geraint was whole again, they past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Arthur to Caerleon upon Usk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the great Queen once more embraced her friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clothed her in apparel like the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though Geraint could never take again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That comfort from their converse which he took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the Queen’s fair name was breathed upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rested well content that all was well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence after tarrying for a space they rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fifty knights rode with them to the shores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Severn, and they past to their own land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he kept the justice of the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So vigorously yet mildly, that all hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Applauded, and the spiteful whisper died:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being ever foremost in the chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And victor at the tilt and tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They called him the great Prince and man of men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Enid, whom her ladies loved to call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid the Fair, a grateful people named</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid the Good; and in their halls arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cry of children, Enids and Geraints</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of times to be; nor did he doubt her more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rested in her fealty, till he crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A happy life with a fair death, and fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the heathen of the Northern Sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle, fighting for the blameless King.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Guinevere</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in the holy house at Almesbury</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping, none with her save a little maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A novice: one low light betwixt them burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For hither had she fled, her cause of flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ready to spring, waiting a chance: for this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He chilled the popular praises of the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With silent smiles of slow disparagement;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tampered with the Lords of the White Horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heathen, the brood by Hengist left; and sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make disruption in the Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur, and to splinter it into feuds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Serving his traitorous end; and all his aims</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were sharpened by strong hate for Lancelot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For thus it chanced one morn when all the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been, their wont, a-maying and returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Modred still in green, all ear and eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climbed to the high top of the garden-wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To spy some secret scandal if he might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wiliest and the worst; and more than this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw not, for Sir Lancelot passing by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spied where he couched, and as the gardener’s hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So from the high wall and the flowering grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of grasses Lancelot plucked him by the heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast him as a worm upon the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He, reverencing king’s blood in a bad man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made such excuses as he might, and these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full knightly without scorn; for in those days</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No knight of Arthur’s noblest dealt in scorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, if a man were halt or hunched, in him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorn was allowed as part of his defect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he was answered softly by the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his Table. So Sir Lancelot holp</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, ever after, the small violence done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little bitter pool about a stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the bare coast.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But when Sir Lancelot told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This matter to the Queen, at first she laughed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lightly, to think of Modred’s dusty fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then shuddered, as the village wife who cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I shudder, someone steps across my grave;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then laughed again, but faintlier, for indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She half-foresaw that he, the subtle beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would track her guilt until he found, and hers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would be for evermore a name of scorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforward rarely could she front in hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or elsewhere, Modred’s narrow foxy face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heart-hiding smile, and gray persistent eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforward too, the Powers that tend the soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To help it from the death that cannot die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And save it even in extremes, began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To vex and plague her. Many a time for hours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside the placid breathings of the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dead night, grim faces came and went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her, or a vague spiritual fear⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That keeps the rust of murder on the walls⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held her awake: or if she slept, she dreamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An awful dream; for then she seemed to stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On some vast plain before a setting sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the sun there swiftly made at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ghastly something, and its shadow flew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before it, till it touched her, and she turned⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When lo! her own, that broadening from her feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far cities burnt, and with a cry she woke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all this trouble did not pass but grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till even the clear face of the guileless King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trustful courtesies of household life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Became her bane; and at the last she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Lancelot, get thee hence to thine own land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if thou tarry we shall meet again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if we meet again, some evil chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the people, and our lord the King.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot ever promised, but remained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still they met and met. Again she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they were agreed upon a night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(When the good King should not be there) to meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And part forever. Vivien, lurking, heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She told Sir Modred. Passion-pale they met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And greeted. Hands in hands, and eye to eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low on the border of her couch they sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stammering and staring. It was their last hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A madness of farewells. And Modred brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His creatures to the basement of the tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For testimony; and crying with full voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last,” aroused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all was still: then she, “The end is come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I am shamed forever;” and he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mine be the shame; mine was the sin: but rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fly to my strong castle overseas:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There will I hide thee, till my life shall end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There hold thee with my life against the world.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “Lancelot, wilt thou hold me so?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, friend, for we have taken our farewells.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unwedded: yet rise now, and let us fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I will draw me into sanctuary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bide my doom.” So Lancelot got her horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set her thereon, and mounted on his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then they rode to the divided way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There kissed, and parted weeping: for he past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to his land; but she to Almesbury</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in herself she moaned “Too late, too late!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A blot in heaven, the Raven, flying high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Croaked, and she thought, “He spies a field of death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Begin to slay the folk, and spoil the land.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when she came to Almesbury she spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to the nuns, and said, “Mine enemies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pursue me, but, O peaceful Sisterhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Receive, and yield me sanctuary, nor ask</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her name to whom ye yield it, till her time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tell you:” and her beauty, grace and power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought as a charm upon them, and they spared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ask it.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>So the stately Queen abode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For many a week, unknown, among the nuns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor with them mixed, nor told her name, nor sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrapt in her grief, for housel or for shrift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But communed only with the little maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which often lured her from herself; but now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This night, a rumour wildly blown about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came, that Sir Modred had usurped the realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leagued him with the heathen, while the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was waging war on Lancelot: then she thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“With what a hate the people and the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must hate me,” and bowed down upon her hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silent, until the little maid, who brooked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No silence, brake it, uttering, “Late! so late!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What hour, I wonder, now?” and when she drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No answer, by and by began to hum</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An air the nuns had taught her; “Late, so late!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which when she heard, the Queen looked up, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O maiden, if indeed ye list to sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing, and unbind my heart that I may weep.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat full willingly sang the little maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No light had we: for that we do repent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No light: so late! and dark and chill the night!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O let us in, that we may find the light!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too late, too late: ye cannot enter now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O let us in, though late, to kiss his feet!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So sang the novice, while full passionately,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her head upon her hands, remembering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her thought when first she came, wept the sad Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then said the little novice prattling to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O pray you, noble lady, weep no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But let my words, the words of one so small,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knowing nothing knows but to obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I do not there is penance given⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comfort your sorrows; for they do not flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From evil done; right sure am I of that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who see your tender grace and stateliness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But weigh your sorrows with our lord the King’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weighing find them less; for gone is he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wage grim war against Sir Lancelot there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round that strong castle where he holds the Queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Modred whom he left in charge of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The traitor⁠—Ah sweet lady, the King’s grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For his own self, and his own Queen, and realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For me, I thank the saints, I am not great.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if there ever come a grief to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cry my cry in silence, and have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None knows it, and my tears have brought me good:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But even were the griefs of little ones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As great as those of great ones, yet this grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is added to the griefs the great must bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That howsoever much they may desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silence, they cannot weep behind a cloud:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As even here they talk at Almesbury</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the good King and his wicked Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And were I such a King with such a Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well might I wish to veil her wickedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But were I such a King, it could not be.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to her own sad heart muttered the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will the child kill me with her innocent talk?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But openly she answered, “Must not I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If this false traitor have displaced his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grieve with the common grief of all the realm?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea,” said the maid, “this is all woman’s grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she is woman, whose disloyal life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath wrought confusion in the Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which good King Arthur founded, years ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With signs and miracles and wonders, there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot, ere the coming of the Queen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then thought the Queen within herself again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Will the child kill me with her foolish prate?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But openly she spake and said to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O little maid, shut in by nunnery walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What canst thou know of Kings and Tables Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or what of signs and wonders, but the signs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And simple miracles of thy nunnery?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the little novice garrulously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, but I know: the land was full of signs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wonders ere the coming of the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So said my father, and himself was knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the great Table⁠—at the founding of it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rode thereto from Lyonnesse, and he said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That as he rode, an hour or maybe twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the sunset, down the coast, he heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange music, and he paused, and turning⁠—there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each with a beacon-star upon his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a wild sea-light about his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw them⁠—headland after headland flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far on into the rich heart of the west:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the light the white mermaiden swam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which the little elves of chasm and cleft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, sounding like a distant horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So said my father⁠—yea, and furthermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next morning, while he past the dim-lit woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shook beneath them, as the thistle shakes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still at evenings on before his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, for all the land was full of life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when at last he came to Camelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the hall itself was such a feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As never man had dreamed; for every knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had whatsoever meat he longed for served</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By hands unseen; and even as he said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down in the cellars merry bloated things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouldered the spigot, straddling on the butts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the wine ran: so glad were spirits and men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the coming of the sinful Queen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Were they so glad? ill prophets were they all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spirits and men: could none of them foresee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even thy wise father with his signs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wonders, what has fallen upon the realm?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the novice garrulously again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, one, a bard; of whom my father said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a noble war-song had he sung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even in the presence of an enemy’s fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between the steep cliff and the coming wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a mystic lay of life and death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When round him bent the spirits of the hills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all their dewy hair blown back like flame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So said my father⁠—and that night the bard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang Arthur’s glorious wars, and sang the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wellnigh more than man, and railed at those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who called him the false son of Gorlois:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there was no man knew from whence he came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But after tempest, when the long wave broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a day as still as heaven, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They found a naked child upon the sands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that was Arthur; and they fostered him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he by miracle was approven King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that his grave should be a mystery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all men, like his birth; and could he find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman in her womanhood as great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he was in his manhood, then, he sang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The twain together well might change the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But even in the middle of his song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then thought the Queen, “Lo! they have set her on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our simple-seeming Abbess and her nuns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To play upon me,” and bowed her head nor spake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat the novice crying, with clasped hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shame on her own garrulity garrulously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full often, “and, sweet lady, if I seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To vex an ear too sad to listen to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unmannerly, with prattling and the tales</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which my good father told me, check me too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor let me shame my father’s memory, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of noblest manners, though himself would say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot had the noblest; and he died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed in a tilt, come next, five summers back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left me; but of others who remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the two first-famed for courtesy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pray you check me if I ask amiss⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But pray you, which had noblest, while you moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among them, Lancelot or our lord the King?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the pale Queen looked up and answered her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir Lancelot, as became a noble knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was gracious to all ladies, and the same</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In open battle or the tilting-field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forbore his own advantage, and the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In open battle or the tilting-field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forbore his own advantage, and these two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were the most nobly-mannered men of all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For manners are not idle, but the fruit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea,” said the maid, “be manners such fair fruit?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lancelot’s needs must be a thousand-fold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less noble, being, as all rumour runs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The most disloyal friend in all the world.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To which a mournful answer made the Queen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O closed about by narrowing nunnery-walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What knowest thou of the world, and all its lights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shadows, all the wealth and all the woe?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If ever Lancelot, that most noble knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were for one hour less noble than himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray for him that he scape the doom of fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weep for her that drew him to his doom.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea,” said the little novice, “I pray for both;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I should all as soon believe that his,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot’s, were as noble as the King’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I could think, sweet lady, yours would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as they are, were you the sinful Queen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So she, like many another babbler, hurt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom she would soothe, and harmed where she would heal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here a sudden flush of wrathful heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fired all the pale face of the Queen, who cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Such as thou art be never maiden more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forever! thou their tool, set on to plague</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And play upon, and harry me, petty spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And traitress.” When that storm of anger brake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Guinevere, aghast the maiden rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White as her veil, and stood before the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As tremulously as foam upon the beach</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stands in a wind, ready to break and fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the Queen had added “Get thee hence,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled frighted. Then that other left alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighed, and began to gather heart again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying in herself, “The simple, fearful child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meant nothing, but my own too-fearful guilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Simpler than any child, betrays itself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But help me, heaven, for surely I repent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what is true repentance but in thought⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even in inmost thought to think again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sins that made the past so pleasant to us:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have sworn never to see him more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see him more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And even in saying this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her memory from old habit of the mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went slipping back upon the golden days</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reputed the best knight and goodliest man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambassador, to lead her to his lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his and her retinue moving, they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode under groves that looked a paradise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on from hill to hill, and every day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld at noon in some delicious dale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For brief repast or afternoon repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By couriers gone before; and on again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Dragon of the great Pendragonship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That crowned the state pavilion of the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the Queen immersed in such a trance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moving through the past unconsciously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to that point where first she saw the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ride toward her from the city, sighed to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her journey done, glanced at him, thought him cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High, self-contained, and passionless, not like him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not like my Lancelot”⁠—while she brooded thus</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grew half-guilty in her thoughts again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There rode an armed warrior to the doors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then on a sudden a cry, “The King.” She sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armed feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the long gallery from the outer doors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rang coming, prone from off her seat she fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grovelled with her face against the floor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There with her milk-white arms and shadowy hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She made her face a darkness from the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the darkness heard his armed feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Monotonous and hollow like a Ghost’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Denouncing judgment, but though changed, the King’s:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Liest thou here so low, the child of one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I honoured, happy, dead before thy shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well is it that no child is born of thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The children born of thee are sword and fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The craft of kindred and the Godless hosts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of heathen swarming o’er the Northern Sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom I, while yet Sir Lancelot, my right arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mightiest of my knights, abode with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have everywhere about this land of Christ</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In twelve great battles ruining overthrown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knowest thou now from whence I come⁠—from him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From waging bitter war with him: and he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That did not shun to smite me in worse way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had yet that grace of courtesy in him left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He spared to lift his hand against the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who made him knight: but many a knight was slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many more, and all his kith and kin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clave to him, and abode in his own land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many more when Modred raised revolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of their troth and fealty, clave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Modred, and a remnant stays with me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of this remnant will I leave a part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True men who love me still, for whom I live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To guard thee in the wild hour coming on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest but a hair of this low head be harmed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear not: thou shalt be guarded till my death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howbeit I know, if ancient prophecies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have erred not, that I march to meet my doom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast not made my life so sweet to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I the King should greatly care to live;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear with me for the last time while I show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the Roman left us, and their law</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Relaxed its hold upon us, and the ways</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were filled with rapine, here and there a deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of prowess done redressed a random wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I was first of all the kings who drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The knighthood-errant of this realm and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The realms together under me, their Head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that fair Order of my Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A glorious company, the flower of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve as model for the mighty world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be the fair beginning of a time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I made them lay their hands in mine and swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To reverence the King, as if he were</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their conscience, and their conscience as their King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break the heathen and uphold the Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To honour his own word as if his God’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead sweet lives in purest chastity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To love one maiden only, cleave to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And worship her by years of noble deeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they won her; for indeed I knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of no more subtle master under heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than is the maiden passion for a maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not only to keep down the base in man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But teach high thought, and amiable words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And courtliness, and the desire of fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And love of truth, and all that makes a man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all this throve before I wedded thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believing, ‘lo mine helpmate, one to feel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My purpose and rejoicing in my joy.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then others, following these my mightiest knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drawing foul ensample from fair names,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sinned also, till the loathsome opposite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all my heart had destined did obtain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all through thee! so that this life of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I guard as God’s high gift from scathe and wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not greatly care to lose; but rather think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How sad it were for Arthur, should he live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sit once more within his lonely hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And miss the wonted number of my knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in the golden days before thy sin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For which of us, who might be left, could speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the pure heart, nor seem to glance at thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I should evermore be vext with thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In hanging robe or vacant ornament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For think not, though thou wouldst not love thy lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am not made of so slight elements.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet must I leave thee, woman, to thy shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hold that man the worst of public foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who either for his own or children’s sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To save his blood from scandal, lets the wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom he knows false, abide and rule the house:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For being through his cowardice allowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her station, taken everywhere for pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She like a new disease, unknown to men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Creeps, no precaution used, among the crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes wicked lightnings of her eyes, and saps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With devil’s leaps, and poisons half the young.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better the King’s waste hearth and aching heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than thou reseated in thy place of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mockery of my people, and their bane.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He paused, and in the pause she crept an inch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nearer, and laid her hands about his feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far off a solitary trumpet blew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then waiting by the doors the warhorse neighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At a friend’s voice, and he spake again:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet think not that I come to urge thy crimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, whose vast pity almost makes me die</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see thee, laying there thy golden head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My pride in happier summers, at my feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The doom of treason and the flaming death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(When first I learnt thee hidden here) is past.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pang⁠—which while I weighed thy heart with one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made my tears burn⁠—is also past⁠—in part.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgives: do thou for thine own soul the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But how to take last leave of all I loved?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O golden hair, with which I used to play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not knowing! O imperial-moulded form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beauty such as never woman wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until it became a kingdom’s curse with thee⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Lancelot’s: nay, they never were the King’s.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot take thy hand: that too is flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here looking down on thine polluted, cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I loathe thee:’ yet not less, O Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I was ever virgin save for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My love through flesh hath wrought into my life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So far, that my doom is, I love thee still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let no man dream but that I love thee still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter in that world where all are pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We two may meet before high God, and thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am thine husband⁠—not a smaller soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor Lancelot, nor another. Leave me that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge thee, my last hope. Now must I hence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the thick night I hear the trumpet blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They summon me their King to lead mine hosts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far down to that great battle in the west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I must strike against the man they call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sister’s son⁠—no kin of mine, who leagues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Lords of the White Horse, heathen, and knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traitors⁠—and strike him dead, and meet myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death, or I know not what mysterious doom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou remaining here wilt learn the event;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But hither shall I never come again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Never lie by thy side; see thee no more⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And while she grovelled at his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She felt the King’s breath wander o’er her neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the darkness o’er her fallen head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perceived the waving of his hands that blest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, listening till those armed steps were gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose the pale Queen, and in her anguish found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The casement: “peradventure,” so she thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If I might see his face, and not be seen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And near him the sad nuns with each a light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To guard and foster her for evermore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while he spake to these his helm was lowered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which for crest the golden dragon clung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Britain; so she did not see the face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which then was as an angel’s, but she saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Dragon of the great Pendragonship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even then he turned; and more and more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The moony vapour rolling round the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who seemed the phantom of a Giant in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enwound him fold by fold, and made him gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grayer, till himself became as mist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her, moving ghost-like to his doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Oh Arthur!” there her voice brake suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then⁠—as a stream that spouting from a cliff</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fails in mid air, but gathering at the base</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Re-makes itself, and flashes down the vale⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went on in passionate utterance:</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Gone⁠—my lord!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gone through my sin to slay and to be slain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he forgave me, and I could not speak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell? I should have answered his farewell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mercy choked me. Gone, my lord the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My own true lord! how dare I call him mine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of another cleaves to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And makes me one pollution: he, the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called me polluted: shall I kill myself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What help in that? I cannot kill my sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If soul be soul; nor can I kill my shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No, nor by living can I live it down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The days will grow to weeks, the weeks to months</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The months will add themselves and make the years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The years will roll into the centuries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mine will ever be a name of scorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must not dwell on that defeat of fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the world be; that is but of the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What else? what hope? I think there was a hope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except he mocked me when he spake of hope;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hope he called it; but he never mocks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For mockery is the fume of little hearts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blessed be the King, who hath forgiven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My wickedness to him, and left me hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That in mine own heart I can live down sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And be his mate hereafter in the heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before high God. Ah great and gentle lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wast, as is the conscience of a saint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among his warring senses, to thy knights⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom my false voluptuous pride, that took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full easily all impressions from below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would not look up, or half-despised the height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which I would not or I could not climb⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought I could not breathe in that fine air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That pure severity of perfect light⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I yearned for warmth and colour which I found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Lancelot⁠—now I see thee what thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou art the highest and most human too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not Lancelot, nor another. Is there none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will tell the King I love him though so late?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now⁠—ere he goes to the great Battle? none:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself must tell him in that purer life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now it were too daring. Ah my God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What might I not have made of thy fair world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had I but loved thy highest creature here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was my duty to have loved the highest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It surely was my profit had I known:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It would have been my pleasure had I seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We needs must love the highest when we see it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not Lancelot, nor another.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Here her hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grasped, made her vail her eyes: she looked and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The novice, weeping, suppliant, and said to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, little maid, for am I not forgiven?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then glancing up beheld the holy nuns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All round her, weeping; and her heart was loosed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within her, and she wept with these and said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye know me then, that wicked one, who broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast design and purpose of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O shut me round with narrowing nunnery-walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meek maidens, from the voices crying ‘shame.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I must not scorn myself: he loves me still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let no one dream but that he loves me still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So let me, if you do not shudder at me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shun to call me sister, dwell with you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wear black and white, and be a nun like you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fast with your fasts, not feasting with your feasts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grieve with your griefs, not grieving at your joys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not rejoicing; mingle with your rites;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray and be prayed for; lie before your shrines;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do each low office of your holy house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walk your dim cloister, and distribute dole</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To poor sick people, richer in His eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who ransomed us, and haler too than I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And treat their loathsome hurts and heal mine own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so wear out in almsdeed and in prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sombre close of that voluptuous day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which wrought the ruin of my lord the King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She said: they took her to themselves; and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still hoping, fearing “is it yet too late?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwelt with them, till in time their Abbess died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she, for her good deeds and her pure life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for the power of ministration in her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And likewise for the high rank she had borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was chosen Abbess, there, an Abbess, lived</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For three brief years, and there, an Abbess, past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where beyond these voices there is peace.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Lancelot and Elaine</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Elaine the fair, Elaine the loveable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High in her chamber up a tower to the east</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guarded the sacred shield of Lancelot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which first she placed where the morning’s earliest ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might strike it, and awake her with the gleam;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A case of silk, and braided thereupon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the devices blazoned on the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their own tinct, and added, of her wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A border fantasy of branch and flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yellow-throated nestling in the nest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor rested thus content, but day by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaving her household and good father, climbed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That eastern tower, and entering barred her door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stript off the case, and read the naked shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now made a pretty history to herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of every dint a sword had beaten in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every scratch a lance had made upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjecturing when and where: this cut is fresh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ten years back; this dealt him at Caerlyle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That at Caerleon; this at Camelot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ah God’s mercy, what a stroke was there!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here a thrust that might have killed, but God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broke the strong lance, and rolled his enemy down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saved him: so she lived in fantasy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How came the lily maid by that good shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot, she that knew not even his name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left it with her, when he rode to tilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the great diamond in the diamond jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which Arthur had ordained, and by that name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had named them, since a diamond was the prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Arthur, long before they crowned him King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roving the trackless realms of Lyonnesse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had found a glen, gray boulder and black tarn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horror lived about the tarn, and clave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like its own mists to all the mountain side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here two brothers, one a king, had met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fought together; but their names were lost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each had slain his brother at a blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down they fell and made the glen abhorred:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there they lay till all their bones were bleached,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lichened into colour with the crags:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he, that once was king, had on a crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a misty moonshine, unawares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolled into light, and turning on its rims</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set it on his head, and in his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard murmurs, “Lo, thou likewise shalt be King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereafter, when a King, he had the gems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Plucked from the crown, and showed them to his knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “These jewels, whereupon I chanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divinely, are the kingdom’s, not the King’s⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For public use: henceforward let there be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once every year, a joust for one of these:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so by nine years’ proof we needs must learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is our mightiest, and ourselves shall grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In use of arms and manhood, till we drive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen, who, some say, shall rule the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter, which God hinder.” Thus he spoke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eight years past, eight jousts had been, and still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Lancelot won the diamond of the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With purpose to present them to the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all were won; but meaning all at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To snare her royal fancy with a boon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worth half her realm, had never spoken word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now for the central diamond and the last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And largest, Arthur, holding then his court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard on the river nigh the place which now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is this world’s hugest, let proclaim a joust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot, and when the time drew nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake (for she had been sick) to Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are you so sick, my Queen, you cannot move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these fair jousts?” “Yea, lord,” she said, “ye know it.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then will ye miss,” he answered, “the great deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot, and his prowess in the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sight ye love to look on.” And the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted her eyes, and they dwelt languidly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Lancelot, where he stood beside the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He thinking that he read her meaning there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stay with me, I am sick; my love is more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than many diamonds,” yielded; and a heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(However much he yearned to make complete</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tale of diamonds for his destined boon)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urged him to speak against the truth, and say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lets me from the saddle;” and the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced first at him, then her, and went his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No sooner gone than suddenly she began:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To blame, my lord Sir Lancelot, much to blame!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why go ye not to these fair jousts? the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are half of them our enemies, and the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will murmur, ‘Lo the shameless ones, who take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their pastime now the trustful King is gone!’ ”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lancelot vext at having lied in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are ye so wise? ye were not once so wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My Queen, that summer, when ye loved me first.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then of the crowd ye took no more account</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than of the myriad cricket of the mead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When its own voice clings to each blade of grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every voice is nothing. As to knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Them surely can I silence with all ease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now my loyal worship is allowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all men: many a bard, without offence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has linked our names together in his lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, the flower of bravery, Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pearl of beauty: and our knights at feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have pledged us in this union, while the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would listen smiling. How then? is there more?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has Arthur spoken aught? or would yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now weary of my service and devoir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforth be truer to your faultless lord?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She broke into a little scornful laugh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That passionate perfection, my good lord⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never spake word of reproach to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cares not for me: only here today</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some meddling rogue has tampered with him⁠—else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swearing men to vows impossible,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make them like himself: but, friend, to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is all fault who hath no fault at all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For who loves me must have a touch of earth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The low sun makes the colour: I am yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not Arthur’s, as ye know, save by the bond.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore hear my words: go to the jousts:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tiny-trumpeting gnat can break our dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When sweetest; and the vermin voices here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May buzz so loud⁠—we scorn them, but they sting.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And with what face, after my pretext made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a King who honours his own word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if it were his God’s?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Yea,” said the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A moral child without the craft to rule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else had he not lost me: but listen to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I must find you wit: we hear it said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men go down before your spear at a touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But knowing you are Lancelot; your great name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This conquers: hide it therefore; go unknown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Win! by this kiss you will: and our true King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will then allow your pretext, O my knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As all for glory; for to speak him true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye know right well, how meek soe’er he seem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No keener hunter after glory breathes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loves it in his knights more than himself:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They prove to him his work: win and return.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then got Sir Lancelot suddenly to horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth at himself. Not willing to be known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He left the barren-beaten thoroughfare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chose the green path that showed the rarer foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there among the solitary downs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full often lost in fancy, lost his way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till as he traced a faintly-shadowed track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all in loops and links among the dales</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to the Castle of Astolat, he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fired from the west, far on a hill, the towers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither he made, and blew the gateway horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came an old, dumb, myriad-wrinkled man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who let him into lodging and disarmed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot marvelled at the wordless man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And issuing found the Lord of Astolat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With two strong sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moving to meet him in the castle court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And close behind them stept the lily maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elaine, his daughter: mother of the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was not: some light jest among them rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With laughter dying down as the great knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approached them: then the Lord of Astolat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whence comes thou, my guest, and by what name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Livest thou between the lips? for by thy state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presence I might guess thee chief of those,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the King, who eat in Arthur’s halls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him have I seen: the rest, his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Known as they are, to me they are unknown.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Sir Lancelot, the chief of knights:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Known am I, and of Arthur’s hall, and known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I by mere mischance have brought, my shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since I go to joust as one unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot for the diamond, ask me not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter ye shall know me⁠—and the shield⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you lend me one, if such you have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blank, or at least with some device not mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said the Lord of Astolat, “Here is Torre’s:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurt in his first tilt was my son, Sir Torre.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so, God wot, his shield is blank enough.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His ye can have.” Then added plain Sir Torre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, since I cannot use it, ye may have it.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here laughed the father saying, “Fie, Sir Churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is that answer for a noble knight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allow him! but Lavaine, my younger here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He is so full of lustihood, he will ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joust for it, and win, and bring it in an hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And set it in this damsel’s golden hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make her thrice as wilful as before.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, father, nay good father, shame me not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before this noble knight,” said young Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For nothing. Surely I but played on Torre:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seemed so sullen, vext he could not go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A jest, no more! for, knight, the maiden dreamt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That someone put this diamond in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that it was too slippery to be held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slipt and fell into some pool or stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The castle-well, belike; and then I said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if I went and if I fought and won it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(But all was jest and joke among ourselves)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then must she keep it safelier. All was jest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, father, give me leave, an if he will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride to Camelot with this noble knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Win shall I not, but do my best to win:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Young as I am, yet would I do my best.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So will ye grace me,” answered Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiling a moment, “with your fellowship</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er these waste downs whereon I lost myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then were I glad of you as guide and friend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you shall win this diamond⁠—as I hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is a fair large diamond⁠—if ye may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yield it to this maiden, if ye will.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A fair large diamond,” added plain Sir Torre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Such be for queens, and not for simple maids.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she, who held her eyes upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elaine, and heard her name so tost about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flushed slightly at the slight disparagement</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the stranger knight, who, looking at her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full courtly, yet not falsely, thus returned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If what is fair be but for what is fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only queens are to be counted so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rash were my judgment then, who deem this maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not violating the bond of like to like.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke and ceased: the lily maid Elaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Won by the mellow voice before she looked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lifted her eyes, and read his lineaments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great and guilty love he bare the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In battle with the love he bare his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had marred his face, and marked it ere his time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another sinning on such heights with one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The flower of all the west and all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had been the sleeker for it: but in him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His mood was often like a fiend, and rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drove him into wastes and solitudes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For agony, who was yet a living soul.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marred as he was, he seemed the goodliest man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever among ladies ate in hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And noblest, when she lifted up her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However marred, of more than twice her years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bruised and bronzed, she lifted up her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved him, with that love which was her doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the great knight, the darling of the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loved of the loveliest, into that rude hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stept with all grace, and not with half disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid under grace, as in a smaller time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kindly man moving among his kind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom they with meats and vintage of their best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And talk and minstrel melody entertained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And much they asked of court and Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever well and readily answered he:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Lancelot, when they glanced at Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly speaking of the wordless man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard from the Baron that, ten years before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen caught and reft him of his tongue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He learnt and warned me of their fierce design</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against my house, and him they caught and maimed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I, my sons, and little daughter fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From bonds or death, and dwelt among the woods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the great river in a boatman’s hut.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Pagan yet once more on Badon hill.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O there, great lord, doubtless,” Lavaine said, rapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By all the sweet and sudden passion of youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward greatness in its elder, “you have fought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O tell us⁠—for we live apart⁠—you know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur’s glorious wars.” And Lancelot spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered him at full, as having been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Arthur in the fight which all day long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rang by the white mouth of the violent Glem;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the four loud battles by the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Duglas; that on Bassa; then the war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That thundered in and out the gloomy skirts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Celidon the forest; and again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By castle Gurnion, where the glorious King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had on his cuirass worn our Lady’s Head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carved of one emerald centered in a sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of silver rays, that lightened as he breathed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at Caerleon had he helped his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the strong neighings of the wild white Horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set every gilded parapet shuddering;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up in Agned-Cathregonion too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the waste sand-shores of Trath Treroit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where many a heathen fell; “and on the mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Badon I myself beheld the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Charge at the head of all his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his legions crying Christ and him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And break them; and I saw him, after, stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on a heap of slain, from spur to plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red as the rising sun with heathen blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing me, with a great voice he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘They are broken, they are broken!’ for the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However mild he seems at home, nor cares</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For triumph in our mimic wars, the jousts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if his own knight cast him down, he laughs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, his knights are better men than he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet in this heathen war the fire of God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fills him: I never saw his like: there lives</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No greater leader.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>While he uttered this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low to her own heart said the lily maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Save your own great self, fair lord;” and when he fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From talk of war to traits of pleasantry⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being mirthful he, but in a stately kind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She still took note that when the living smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died from his lips, across him came a cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of melancholy severe, from which again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever in her hovering to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lily maid had striven to make him cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There brake a sudden-beaming tenderness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of manners and of nature: and she thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all was nature, all, perchance, for her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all night long his face before her lived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As when a painter, poring on a face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Divinely through all hindrance finds the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind it, and so paints him that his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shape and colour of a mind and life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lives for his children, ever at its best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fullest; so the face before her lived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dark-splendid, speaking in the silence, full</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of noble things, and held her from her sleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till rathe she rose, half-cheated in the thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First in fear, step after step, she stole</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the long tower-stairs, hesitating:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon, she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“This shield, my friend, where is it?” and Lavaine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past inward, as she came from out the tower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There to his proud horse Lancelot turned, and smoothed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glossy shoulder, humming to himself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-envious of the flattering hand, she drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nearer and stood. He looked, and more amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than if seven men had set upon him, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden standing in the dewy light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He had not dreamed she was so beautiful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came on him a sort of sacred fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For silent, though he greeted her, she stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt on his face as if it were a God’s.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he should wear her favour at the tilt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She braved a riotous heart in asking for it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair lord, whose name I know not⁠—noble it is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe, the noblest⁠—will you wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My favour at this tourney?” “Nay,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair lady, since I never yet have worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Favour of any lady in the lists.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such is my wont, as those, who know me, know.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, so,” she answered; “then in wearing mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs must be lesser likelihood, noble lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That those who know should know you.” And he turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her counsel up and down within his mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found it true, and answered, “True, my child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, I will wear it: fetch it out to me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is it?” and she told him “A red sleeve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broidered with pearls,” and brought it: then he bound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her token on his helmet, with a smile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “I never yet have done so much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any maiden living,” and the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang to her face and filled her with delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left her all the paler, when Lavaine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brother’s; which he gave to Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who parted with his own to fair Elaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do me this grace, my child, to have my shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In keeping till I come.” “A grace to me,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “twice today. I am your squire!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat Lavaine said, laughing, “Lily maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fear our people call you lily maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In earnest, let me bring your colour back;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once, twice, and thrice: now get you hence to bed:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So kissed her, and Sir Lancelot his own hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus they moved away: she stayed a minute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then made a sudden step to the gate, and there⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her bright hair blown about the serious face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet rosy-kindled with her brother’s kiss⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paused by the gateway, standing near the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence, while she watched their arms far-off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparkle, until they dipt below the downs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then to her tower she climbed, and took the shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There kept it, and so lived in fantasy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the new companions past away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far o’er the long backs of the bushless downs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not far from Camelot, now for forty years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hermit, who had prayed, laboured and prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever labouring had scooped himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the white rock a chapel and a hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On massive columns, like a shore-cliff cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cells and chambers: all were fair and dry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The green light from the meadows underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck up and lived along the milky roofs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And poplars made a noise of falling showers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thither wending there that night they bode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the next day broke from underground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shot red fire and shadows through the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They rose, heard mass, broke fast, and rode away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lancelot saying, “Hear, but hold my name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hidden, you ride with Lancelot of the Lake,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Abashed young Lavaine, whose instant reverence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left him leave to stammer, “Is it indeed?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after muttering “The great Lancelot,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last he got his breath and answered, “One,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One have I seen⁠—that other, our liege lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dread Pendragon, Britain’s King of kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom the people talk mysteriously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will be there⁠—then were I stricken blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That minute, I might say that I had seen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake Lavaine, and when they reached the lists</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Run through the peopled gallery which half round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Robed in red samite, easily to be known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since to his crown the golden dragon clung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the carven-work behind him crept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through knots and loops and folds innumerable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The new design wherein they lost themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with all ease, so tender was the work:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, in the costly canopy o’er him set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Me you call great: mine is the firmer seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The truer lance: but there is many a youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now crescent, who will come to all I am</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overcome it; and in me there dwells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No greatness, save it be some far-off touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of greatness to know well I am not great:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is the man.” And Lavaine gaped upon him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As on a thing miraculous, and anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The trumpets blew; and then did either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They that assailed, and they that held the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set lance in rest, strike spur, suddenly move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meet in the midst, and there so furiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shock, that a man far-off might well perceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any man that day were left afield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hard earth shake, and a low thunder of arms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot bode a little, till he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which were the weaker; then he hurled into it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the stronger: little need to speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot in his glory! King, duke, earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Count, baron⁠—whom he smote, he overthrew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But in the field were Lancelot’s kith and kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should do and almost overdo the deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot; and one said to the other, “Lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is he? I do not mean the force alone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The grace and versatility of the man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is it not Lancelot?” “When has Lancelot worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Favour of any lady in the lists?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not such his wont, as we, that know him, know.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“How then? who then?” a fury seized them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fiery family passion for the name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot, and a glory one with theirs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They couched their spears and pricked their steeds, and thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In moving, all together down upon him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare, as a wild wave in the wide North-sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green-glimmering toward the summit, bears, with all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Its stormy crests that smoke against the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on a bark, and overbears the bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And him that helms it, so they overbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot and his charger, and a spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down-glancing lamed the charger, and a spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pricked sharply his own cuirass, and the head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierced through his side, and there snapt, and remained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bore a knight of old repute to the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brought his horse to Lancelot where he lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He up the side, sweating with agony, got,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thought to do while he might yet endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being lustily holpen by the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His party⁠—though it seemed half-miracle</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To those he fought with⁠—drave his kith and kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the Table Round that held the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the barrier; then the trumpets blew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proclaiming his the prize, who wore the sleeve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of scarlet, and the pearls; and all the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His party, cried “Advance and take thy prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The diamond;” but he answered, “Diamond me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No diamonds! for God’s love, a little air!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prize me no prizes, for my prize is death!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hence will I, and I charge you, follow me not.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and vanished suddenly from the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With young Lavaine into the poplar grove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There from his charger down he slid, and sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gasping to Sir Lavaine, “Draw the lance-head:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah my sweet lord Sir Lancelot,” said Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I dread me, if I draw it, you will die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, “I die already with it: draw⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Draw,”⁠—and Lavaine drew, and Sir Lancelot gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And half his blood burst forth, and down he sank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the pure pain, and wholly swooned away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the hermit out and bare him in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There stanched his wound; and there, in daily doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whether to live or die, for many a week</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hid from the wide world’s rumour by the grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of poplars with their noise of falling showers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever-tremulous aspen-trees, he lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His party, knights of utmost North and West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate isles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo, Sire, our knight, through whom we won the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath gone sore wounded, and hath left his prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untaken, crying that his prize is death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Heaven hinder,” said the King, “that such an one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great a knight as we have seen today⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He seemed to me another Lancelot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, twenty times I thought him Lancelot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He must not pass uncared for. Wherefore, rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Gawain, and ride forth and find the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wounded and wearied needs must he be near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I charge you that you get at once to horse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, knights and kings, there breathes not one of you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will deem this prize of ours is rashly given:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His prowess was too wondrous. We will do him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No customary honour: since the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came not to us, of us to claim the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ourselves will send it after. Rise and take</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This diamond, and deliver it, and return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring us where he is, and how he fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cease not from your quest until ye find.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, from the carven flower above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which it made a restless heart, he took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave, the diamond: then from where he sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Arthur’s right, with smiling face arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With smiling face and frowning heart, a Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the mid might and flourish of his May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gawain, surnamed The Courteous, fair and strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after Lancelot, Tristram, and Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gareth, a good knight, but therewithal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Modred’s brother, and the child of Lot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor often loyal to his word, and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth that the King’s command to sally forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In quest of whom he knew not, made him leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The banquet, and concourse of knights and kings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So all in wrath he got to horse and went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While Arthur to the banquet, dark in mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past, thinking “Is it Lancelot who hath come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Despite the wound he spake of, all for gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glory, and hath added wound to wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ridden away to die?” So feared the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after two days’ tarriance there, returned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then when he saw the Queen, embracing asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Love, are you yet so sick?” “Nay, lord,” she said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And where is Lancelot?” Then the Queen amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Was he not with you? won he not your prize?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, but one like him.” “Why that like was he.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the King demanded how she knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said, “Lord, no sooner had ye parted from us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than Lancelot told me of a common talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men went down before his spear at a touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But knowing he was Lancelot; his great name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conquered; and therefore would he hide his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From all men, even the King, and to this end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made a pretext of a hindering wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he might joust unknown of all, and learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If his old prowess were in aught decayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And added, ‘Our true Arthur, when he learns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will well allow me pretext, as for gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of purer glory.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then replied the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Far lovelier in our Lancelot had it been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lieu of idly dallying with the truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have trusted me as he hath trusted thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely his King and most familiar friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might well have kept his secret. True, indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit I know my knights fantastical,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fine a fear in our large Lancelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must needs have moved my laughter: now remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But little cause for laughter: his own kin⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that he went sore wounded from the field:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet good news too: for goodly hopes are mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wore, against his wont, upon his helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some gentle maiden’s gift.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Yea, lord,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thy hopes are mine,” and saying that, she choked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sharply turned about to hide her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past to her chamber, and there flung herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on the great King’s couch, and writhed upon it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrieked out “Traitor” to the unhearing wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then flashed into wild tears, and rose again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moved about her palace, proud and pale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gawain the while through all the region round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode with his diamond, wearied of the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touched at all points, except the poplar grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And came at last, though late, to Astolat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced at, and cried, “What news from Camelot, lord?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What of the knight with the red sleeve?” “He won.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I knew it,” she said. “But parted from the jousts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurt in the side,” whereat she caught her breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereon she smote her hand: wellnigh she swooned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, while he gazed wonderingly at her, came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Lord of Astolat out, to whom the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reported who he was, and on what quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The victor, but had ridden a random round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek him, and had wearied of the search.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the Lord of Astolat, “Bide with us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride no more at random, noble Prince!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here was the knight, and here he left a shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This will he send or come for: furthermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Needs must hear.” To this the courteous Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accorded with his wonted courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where could be found face daintier? then her shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From forehead down to foot, perfect⁠—again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Well⁠—if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And oft they met among the garden yews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he set himself to play upon her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sallying wit, free flashes from a height</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above her, graces of the court, and songs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighs, and slow smiles, and golden eloquence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And amorous adulation, till the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rebelled against it, saying to him, “Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O loyal nephew of our noble King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why ask you not to see the shield he left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whence you might learn his name? Why slight your King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lose the quest he sent you on, and prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No surer than our falcon yesterday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lost the hern we slipt her at, and went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the winds?” “Nay, by mine head,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I lose it, as we lose the lark in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O damsel, in the light of your blue eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But an ye will it let me see the shield.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the shield was brought, and Gawain saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot’s azure lions, crowned with gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ramp in the field, he smote his thigh, and mocked:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Right was the King! our Lancelot! that true man!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And right was I,” she answered merrily, “I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And if I dreamed,” said Gawain, “that you love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This greatest knight, your pardon! lo, ye know it!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak therefore: shall I waste myself in vain?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full simple was her answer, “What know I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brethren have been all my fellowship;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, when often they have talked of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wished it had been my mother, for they talked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meseemed, of what they knew not; so myself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not if I know what true love is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if I know, then, if I love not him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know there is none other I can love.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, by God’s death,” said he, “ye love him well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But would not, knew ye what all others know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whom he loves.” “So be it,” cried Elaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifted her fair face and moved away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he pursued her, calling, “Stay a little!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One golden minute’s grace! he wore your sleeve:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would he break faith with one I may not name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must our true man change like a leaf at last?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—like enow: why then, far be it from me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, damsel, for I deem you know full well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where your great knight is hidden, let me leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My quest with you; the diamond also: here!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if you love, it will be sweet to give it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he love, it will be sweet to have it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From your own hand; and whether he love or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A diamond is a diamond. Fare you well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand times!⁠—a thousand times farewell!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, if he love, and his love hold, we two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May meet at court hereafter: there, I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So ye will learn the courtesies of the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We two shall know each other.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then he gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slightly kissed the hand to which he gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The diamond, and all wearied of the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt on his horse, and carolling as he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A true-love ballad, lightly rode away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence to the court he past; there told the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the King knew, “Sir Lancelot is the knight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And added, “Sire, my liege, so much I learnt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But failed to find him, though I rode all round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The region: but I lighted on the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose sleeve he wore; she loves him; and to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeming our courtesy is the truest law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I gave the diamond: she will render it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by mine head she knows his hiding-place.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The seldom-frowning King frowned, and replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Too courteous truly! ye shall go no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On quest of mine, seeing that ye forget</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Obedience is the courtesy due to kings.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake and parted. Wroth, but all in awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For twenty strokes of the blood, without a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lingered that other, staring after him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then shook his hair, strode off, and buzzed abroad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the maid of Astolat, and her love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All ears were pricked at once, all tongues were loosed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some read the King’s face, some the Queen’s, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had marvel what the maid might be, but most</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Predoomed her as unworthy. One old dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She, that had heard the noise of it before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marred her friend’s aim with pale tranquillity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So ran the tale like fire about the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire in dry stubble a nine-days’ wonder flared:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiled at each other, while the Queen, who sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With lips severely placid, felt the knot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climb in her throat, and with her feet unseen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crushed the wild passion out against the floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the banquet, where all the meats became</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As wormwood, and she hated all who pledged.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But far away the maid in Astolat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her guiltless rival, she that ever kept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The one-day-seen Sir Lancelot in her heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crept to her father, while he mused alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat on his knee, stroked his gray face and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Father, you call me wilful, and the fault</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is yours who let me have my will, and now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet father, will you let me lose my wits?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay,” said he, “surely.” “Wherefore, let me hence,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “and find out our dear Lavaine.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye will not lose your wits for dear Lavaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bide,” answered he: “we needs must hear anon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him, and of that other.” “Ay,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And of that other, for I needs must hence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find that other, wheresoe’er he be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with mine own hand give his diamond to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest I be found as faithless in the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As yon proud Prince who left the quest to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet father, I behold him in my dreams</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death-pale, for lack of gentle maiden’s aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gentler-born the maiden, the more bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father, to be sweet and serviceable</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To noble knights in sickness, as ye know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When these have worn their tokens: let me hence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you.” Then her father nodding said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, ay, the diamond: wit ye well, my child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right fain were I to learn this knight were whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being our greatest: yea, and you must give it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sure I think this fruit is hung too high</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any mouth to gape for save a queen’s⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, I mean nothing: so then, get you gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so very wilful you must go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lightly, her suit allowed, she slipt away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she made her ready for her ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her father’s latest word hummed in her ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Being so very wilful you must go,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And changed itself and echoed in her heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Being so very wilful you must die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she was happy enough and shook it off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her heart she answered it and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What matter, so I help him back to life?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode o’er the long backs of the bushless downs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Camelot, and before the city-gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came on her brother with a happy face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making a roan horse caper and curvet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For pleasure all about a field of flowers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom when she saw, “Lavaine,” she cried, “Lavaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fares my lord Sir Lancelot?” He amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Torre and Elaine! why here? Sir Lancelot!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How know ye my lord’s name is Lancelot?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the maid had told him all her tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then turned Sir Torre, and being in his moods</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left them, and under the strange-statued gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Arthur’s wars were rendered mystically,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past up the still rich city to his kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own far blood, which dwelt at Camelot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And her, Lavaine across the poplar grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led to the caves: there first she saw the casque</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Lancelot on the wall: her scarlet sleeve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though carved and cut, and half the pearls away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streamed from it still; and in her heart she laughed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because he had not loosed it from his helm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But meant once more perchance to tourney in it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when they gained the cell wherein he slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay naked on the wolfskin, and a dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of dragging down his enemy made them move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she that saw him lying unsleek, unshorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uttered a little tender dolorous cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sound not wonted in a place so still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke the sick knight, and while he rolled his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet blank from sleep, she started to him, saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your prize the diamond sent you by the King:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes glistened: she fancied “Is it for me?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the maid had told him all the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of King and Prince, the diamond sent, the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assigned to her not worthy of it, she knelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full lowly by the corners of his bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laid the diamond in his open hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her face was near, and as we kiss the child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That does the task assigned, he kissed her face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once she slipt like water to the floor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas,” he said, “your ride hath wearied you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest must you have.” “No rest for me,” she said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, for near you, fair lord, I am at rest.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What might she mean by that? his large black eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet larger through his leanness, dwelt upon her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all her heart’s sad secret blazed itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the heart’s colours on her simple face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot looked and was perplext in mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being weak in body said no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But did not love the colour; woman’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save one, he not regarded, and so turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sighing, and feigned a sleep until he slept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far up the dim rich city to her kin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There bode the night: but woke with dawn, and past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down through the dim rich city to the fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence to the cave: so day by day she past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In either twilight ghost-like to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gliding, and every day she tended him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And likewise many a night: and Lancelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would, though he called his wound a little hurt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof he should be quickly whole, at times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brain-feverous in his heat and agony, seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uncourteous, even he: but the meek maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Milder than any mother to a sick child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never woman yet, since man’s first fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did kindlier unto man, but her deep love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upbore her; till the hermit, skilled in all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The simples and the science of that time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told him that her fine care had saved his life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sick man forgot her simple blush,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would call her friend and sister, sweet Elaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would listen for her coming and regret</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her parting step, and held her tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved her with all love except the love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of man and woman when they love their best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closest and sweetest, and had died the death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In any knightly fashion for her sake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peradventure had he seen her first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have made this and that other world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another world for the sick man; but now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shackles of an old love straitened him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His honour rooted in dishonour stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These, as but born of sickness, could not live:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the blood ran lustier in him again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full often the bright image of one face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then if the maiden, while that ghostly grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beamed on his fancy, spoke, he answered not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or short and coldly, and she knew right well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What the rough sickness meant, but what this meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She knew not, and the sorrow dimmed her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drave her ere her time across the fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far into the rich city, where alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She murmured, “Vain, in vain: it cannot be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will not love me: how then? must I die?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then as a little helpless innocent bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That has but one plain passage of few notes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will sing the simple passage o’er and o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all an April morning, till the ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wearies to hear it, so the simple maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went half the night repeating, “Must I die?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now to right she turned, and now to left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found no ease in turning or in rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And “Him or death,” she muttered, “death or him,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again and like a burthen, “Him or death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when Sir Lancelot’s deadly hurt was whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Astolat returning rode the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that wherein she deemed she looked her best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If I be loved, these are my festal robes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If not, the victim’s flowers before he fall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she should ask some goodly gift of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her own self or hers; “and do not shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speak the wish most near to your true heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such service have ye done me, that I make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine own land, and what I will I can.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But like a ghost without the power to speak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bode among them yet a little space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found her in among the garden yews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “Delay no longer, speak your wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing I go today:” then out she brake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Going? and we shall never see you more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I must die for want of one bold word.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Speak: that I live to hear,” he said, “is yours.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have gone mad. I love you: let me die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, sister,” answered Lancelot, “what is this?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And innocently extending her white arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Your love,” she said, “your love⁠—to be your wife.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot answered, “Had I chosen to wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now there never will be wife of mine.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No, no,” she cried, “I care not to be wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But to be with you still, to see your face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To serve you, and to follow you through the world.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot answered, “Nay, the world, the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blare its own interpretation⁠—nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full ill then should I quit your brother’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And your good father’s kindness.” And she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Not to be with you, not to see your face⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for me then, my good days are done.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, noble maid,” he answered, “ten times nay!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is not love: but love’s first flash in youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most common: yea, I know it of mine own self:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you yourself will smile at your own self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter, when you yield your flower of life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one more fitly yours, not thrice your age:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then will I, for true you are and sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond mine old belief in womanhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More specially should your good knight be poor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endow you with broad land and territory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the half my realm beyond the seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that would make you happy: furthermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the death, as though ye were my blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all your quarrels will I be your knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This I will do, dear damsel, for your sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And more than this I cannot.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>While he spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She neither blushed nor shook, but deathly-pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood grasping what was nearest, then replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Of all this will I nothing;” and so fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thus they bore her swooning to her tower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake, to whom through those black walls of yew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their talk had pierced, her father: “Ay, a flash,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fear me, that will strike my blossom dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too courteous are ye, fair Lord Lancelot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray you, use some rough discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To blunt or break her passion.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Lancelot said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That were against me: what I can I will;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there that day remained, and toward even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent for his shield: full meekly rose the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stript off the case, and gave the naked shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when she heard his horse upon the stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unclasping flung the casement back, and looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on his helm, from which her sleeve had gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot knew the little clinking sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she by tact of love was well aware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Lancelot knew that she was looking at him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet he glanced not up, nor waved his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor bad farewell, but sadly rode away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This was the one discourtesy that he used.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in her tower alone the maiden sat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His very shield was gone; only the case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own poor work, her empty labour, left.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But still she heard him, still his picture formed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grew between her and the pictured wall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came her father, saying in low tones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have comfort,” whom she greeted quietly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came her brethren saying, “Peace to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet sister,” whom she answered with all calm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when they left her to herself again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death, like a friend’s voice from a distant field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approaching through the darkness, called; the owls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wailing had power upon her, and she mixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of evening, and the moanings of the wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in those days she made a little song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called her song “The Song of Love and Death,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sang it: sweetly could she make and sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sweet is true love though given in vain, in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet is death who puts an end to pain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fain would follow love, if that could be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I needs must follow death, who calls for me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call and I follow, I follow! let me die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High with the last line scaled her voice, and this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a fiery dawning wild with wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With shuddering, “Hark the Phantom of the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever shrieks before a death,” and called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The father, and all three in hurry and fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to her, and lo! the blood-red light of dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flared on her face, she shrilling, “Let me die!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when we dwell upon a word we know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Repeating, till the word we know so well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dwelt the father on her face, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is this Elaine?” till back the maiden fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then gave a languid hand to each, and lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaking a still goodmorrow with her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last she said, “Sweet brothers, yesternight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seemed a curious little maid again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As happy as when we dwelt among the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when ye used to take me with the flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up the great river in the boatman’s boat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only ye would not pass beyond the cape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That has the poplar on it: there ye fixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your limit, oft returning with the tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I cried because ye would not pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond it, and far up the shining flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until we found the palace of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet ye would not; but this night I dreamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was all alone upon the flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I said, ‘Now shall I have my will:’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there I woke, but still the wish remained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So let me hence that I may pass at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the poplar and far up the flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until I find the palace of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There will I enter in among them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no man there will dare to mock at me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there the fine Gawain will wonder at me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the great Sir Lancelot muse at me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gawain, who bad a thousand farewells to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, who coldly went, nor bad me one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the King will know me and my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the Queen herself will pity me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the gentle court will welcome me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after my long voyage I shall rest!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Peace,” said her father, “O my child, ye seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Light-headed, for what force is yours to go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So far, being sick? and wherefore would ye look</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On this proud fellow again, who scorns us all?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the rough Torre began to heave and move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bluster into stormy sobs and say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I never loved him: an I meet with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I care not howsoever great he be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I strike at him and strike him down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me good fortune, I will strike him dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this discomfort he hath done the house.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the gentle sister made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fret not yourself, dear brother, nor be wroth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing it is no more Sir Lancelot’s fault</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to love me, than it is mine to love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him of all men who seems to me the highest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Highest?” the father answered, echoing “highest?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(He meant to break the passion in her) “nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Daughter, I know not what you call the highest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this I know, for all the people know it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loves the Queen, and in an open shame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she returns his love in open shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If this be high, what is it to be low?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the lily maid of Astolat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sweet father, all too faint and sick am I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For anger: these are slanders: never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was noble man but made ignoble talk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He makes no friend who never made a foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now it is my glory to have loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One peerless, without stain: so let me pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father, howsoe’er I seem to you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all unhappy, having loved God’s best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And greatest, though my love had no return:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, seeing you desire your child to live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thanks, but you work against your own desire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if I could believe the things you say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should but die the sooner; wherefore cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet father, and bid call the ghostly man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither, and let me shrive me clean, and die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So when the ghostly man had come and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She with a face, bright as for sin forgiven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besought Lavaine to write as she devised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A letter, word for word; and when he asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is it for Lancelot, is it for my dear lord?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I bear it gladly;” she replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For Lancelot and the Queen and all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I myself must bear it.” Then he wrote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The letter she devised; which being writ</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And folded, “O sweet father, tender and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deny me not,” she said⁠—“ye never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Denied my fancies⁠—this, however strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My latest: lay the letter in my hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little ere I die, and close the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon it; I shall guard it even in death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the heat is gone from out my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then take the little bed on which I died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot’s love, and deck it like the Queen’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For richness, and me also like the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all I have of rich, and lay me on it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let there be prepared a chariot-bier</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take me to the river, and a barge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be ready on the river, clothed in black.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I go in state to court, to meet the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There surely I shall speak for mine own self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none of you can speak for me so well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore let our dumb old man alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go with me, he can steer and row, and he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will guide me to that palace, to the doors.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ceased: her father promised; whereupon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She grew so cheerful that they deemed her death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was rather in the fantasy than the blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ten slow mornings past, and on the eleventh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her father laid the letter in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And closed the hand upon it, and she died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that day there was dole in Astolat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the next sun brake from underground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, those two brethren slowly with bent brows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past like a shadow through the field, that shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full-summer, to that stream whereon the barge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There sat the life-long creature of the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So those two brethren from the chariot took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the black decks laid her in her bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set in her hand a lily, o’er her hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The silken case with braided blazonings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sister, farewell forever,” and again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Farewell, sweet sister,” parted all in tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oared by the dumb, went upward with the flood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her right hand the lily, in her left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The letter⁠—all her bright hair streaming down⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the coverlid was cloth of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All but her face, and that clear-featured face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That day Sir Lancelot at the palace craved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Audience of Guinevere, to give at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The price of half a realm, his costly gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard-won and hardly won with bruise and blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With deaths of others, and almost his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nine-years-fought-for diamonds: for he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One of her house, and sent him to the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing his wish, whereto the Queen agreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such and so unmoved a majesty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have seemed her statue, but that he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low-drooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For loyal awe, saw with a sidelong eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadow of some piece of pointed lace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Queen’s shadow, vibrate on the walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And parted, laughing in his courtly heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All in an oriel on the summer side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vine-clad, of Arthur’s palace toward the stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They met, and Lancelot kneeling uttered, “Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take, what I had not won except for you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These jewels, and make me happy, making them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or necklace for a neck to which the swan’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is tawnier than her cygnet’s: these are words:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Words, as we grant grief tears. Such sin in words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance, we both can pardon: but, my Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear of rumours flying through your court.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have in it an absoluter trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make up that defect: let rumours be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you trust me in your own nobleness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I may not well believe that you believe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While thus he spoke, half turned away, the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the place whereon she stood was green;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Received at once and laid aside the gems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There on a table near her, and replied:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It may be, I am quicker of belief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This good is in it, whatsoe’er of ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It can be broken easier. I for you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This many a year have done despite and wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one whom ever in my heart of hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I did acknowledge nobler. What are these?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being your gift, had you not lost your own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To loyal hearts the value of all gifts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must vary as the giver’s. Not for me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her! for your new fancy. Only this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grant me, I pray you: have your joys apart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I doubt not that however changed, you keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much of what is graceful: and myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which as Arthur’s Queen I move and rule:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So cannot speak my mind. An end to this!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An armlet for an arm to which the Queen’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O as much fairer⁠—as a faith once fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was richer than these diamonds⁠—hers not mine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shall not have them.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Saying which she seized,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, through the casement standing wide for heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flung them, and down they flashed, and smote the stream.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then from the smitten surface flashed, as it were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close underneath his eyes, and right across</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon the lily maid of Astolat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the wild Queen, who saw not, burst away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To weep and wail in secret; and the barge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On to the palace-doorway sliding, paused.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There two stood armed, and kept the door; to whom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All up the marble stair, tier over tier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were added mouths that gaped, and eyes that asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What is it?” but that oarsman’s haggard face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As hard and still as is the face that men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shape to their fancy’s eye from broken rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On some cliff-side, appalled them, and they said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He is enchanted, cannot speak⁠—and she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look how she sleeps⁠—the Fairy Queen, so fair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, but how pale! what are they? flesh and blood?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or come to take the King to Fairyland?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For some do hold our Arthur cannot die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that he passes into Fairyland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While thus they babbled of the King, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came girt with knights: then turned the tongueless man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the half-face to the full eye, and rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pointed to the damsel, and the doors.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Arthur bad the meek Sir Percivale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pure Sir Galahad to uplift the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reverently they bore her into hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then came the fine Gawain and wondered at her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot later came and mused at her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And last the Queen herself, and pitied her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Most noble lord, Sir Lancelot of the Lake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, for you left me taking no farewell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither, to take my last farewell of you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I loved you, and my love had no return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore my true love has been my death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore to our Lady Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to all other ladies, I make moan:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray for my soul, and yield me burial.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray for my soul thou too, Sir Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou art a knight peerless.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Thus he read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever in the reading, lords and dames</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept, looking often from his face who read</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hers which lay so silent, and at times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So touched were they, half-thinking that her lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had devised the letter, moved again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then freely spoke Sir Lancelot to them all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My lord liege Arthur, and all ye that hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know that for this most gentle maiden’s death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right heavy am I; for good she was and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But loved me with a love beyond all love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In women, whomsoever I have known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet to be loved makes not to love again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not at my years, however it hold in youth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swear by truth and knighthood that I gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No cause, not willingly, for such a love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To this I call my friends in testimony,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her brethren, and her father, who himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Besought me to be plain and blunt, and use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break her passion, some discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against my nature: what I could, I did.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I left her and I bad her no farewell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though, had I dreamt the damsel would have died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might have put my wits to some rough use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And helped her from herself.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then said the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Sea was her wrath, yet working after storm)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye might at least have done her so much grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair lord, as would have helped her from her death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He raised his head, their eyes met and hers fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He adding,</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Queen, she would not be content</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that I wedded her, which could not be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then might she follow me through the world, she asked;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It could not be. I told her that her love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was but the flash of youth, would darken down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rise hereafter in a stiller flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toward one more worthy of her⁠—then would I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More specially were he, she wedded, poor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Estate them with large land and territory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine own realm beyond the narrow seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep them in all joyance: more than this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I could not; this she would not, and she died.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He pausing, Arthur answered, “O my knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It will be to thy worship, as my knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mine, as head of all our Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see that she be buried worshipfully.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So toward that shrine which then in all the realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was richest, Arthur leading, slowly went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The marshalled Order of their Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot sad beyond his wont, to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The maiden buried, not as one unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor meanly, but with gorgeous obsequies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mass, and rolling music, like a queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the knights had laid her comely head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low in the dust of half-forgotten kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Arthur spake among them, “Let her tomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be costly, and her image thereupon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the shield of Lancelot at her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be carven, and her lily in her hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the story of her dolorous voyage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In letters gold and azure!” which was wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereafter; but when now the lords and dames</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And people, from the high door streaming, brake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Disorderly, as homeward each, the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who marked Sir Lancelot where he moved apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew near, and sighed in passing, “Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgive me; mine was jealousy in love.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He answered with his eyes upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That is love’s curse; pass on, my Queen, forgiven.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur, who beheld his cloudy brows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Approached him, and with full affection said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lancelot, my Lancelot, thou in whom I have</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most joy and most affiance, for I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What thou hast been in battle by my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a time have watched thee at the tilt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike down the lusty and long practised knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let the younger and unskilled go by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To win his honour and to make his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved thy courtesies and thee, a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made to be loved; but now I would to God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou couldst have loved this maiden, shaped, it seems,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By God for thee alone, and from her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If one may judge the living by the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delicately pure and marvellously fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who might have brought thee, now a lonely man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wifeless and heirless, noble issue, sons</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born to the glory of thine name and fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knight, the great Sir Lancelot of the Lake.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Lancelot, “Fair she was, my King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pure, as you ever wish your knights to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To doubt her fairness were to want an eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To doubt her pureness were to want a heart⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, to be loved, if what is worthy love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could bind him, but free love will not be bound.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Free love, so bound, were freest,” said the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Let love be free; free love is for the best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after heaven, on our dull side of death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What should be best, if not so pure a love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She failed to bind, though being, as I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Lancelot answered nothing, but he went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the inrunning of a little brook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat by the river in a cove, and watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The high reed wave, and lifted up his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw the barge that brought her moving down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far-off, a blot upon the stream, and said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low in himself, “Ah simple heart and sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye loved me, damsel, surely with a love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far tenderer than my Queen’s. Pray for thy soul?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, that will I. Farewell too⁠—now at last⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell, fair lily. ‘Jealousy in love?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rather dead love’s harsh heir, jealous pride?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Queen, if I grant the jealousy as of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May not your crescent fear for name and fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, as it waxes, of a love that wanes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why did the King dwell on my name to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught from his mother’s arms⁠—the wondrous one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who passes through the vision of the night⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She kissed me saying, ‘Thou art fair, my child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As a king’s son,’ and often in her arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bare me, pacing on the dusky mere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would she had drowned me in it, where’er it be!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what am I? what profits me my name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of greatest knight? I fought for it, and have it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now grown a part of me: but what use in it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make men worse by making my sin known?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sin seem less, the sinner seeming great?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas for Arthur’s greatest knight, a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not after Arthur’s heart! I needs must break</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These bonds that so defame me: not without</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She wills it: would I, if she willed it? nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows? but if I would not, then may God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pray him, send a sudden Angel down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seize me by the hair and bear me far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fling me deep in that forgotten mere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the tumbled fragments of the hills.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So groaned Sir Lancelot in remorseful pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not knowing he should die a holy man.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Merlin and Vivien</h2>
			<p>
				<span>A storm was coming, but the winds were still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the wild woods of Broceliande,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before an oak, so hollow, huge and old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It looked a tower of ivied masonwork,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Merlin’s feet the wily Vivien lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he that always bare in bitter grudge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slights of Arthur and his Table, Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Cornish King, had heard a wandering voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A minstrel of Caerlon by strong storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blown into shelter at Tintagil, say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That out of naked knightlike purity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the great Queen herself, fought in her name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware by her⁠—vows like theirs, that high in heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love most, but neither marry, nor are given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In marriage, angels of our Lord’s report.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ceased, and then⁠—for Vivien sweetly said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(She sat beside the banquet nearest Mark),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And is the fair example followed, Sir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s household?”⁠—answered innocently:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay, by some few⁠—ay, truly⁠—youths that hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It more beseems the perfect virgin knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To worship woman as true wife beyond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All hopes of gaining, than as maiden girl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They place their pride in Lancelot and the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So passionate for an utter purity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the limit of their bond, are these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Arthur bound them not to singleness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brave hearts and clean! and yet⁠—God guide them⁠—young.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Mark was half in heart to hurl his cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight at the speaker, but forbore: he rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave the hall, and, Vivien following him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned to her: “Here are snakes within the grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And you methinks, O Vivien, save ye fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monkish manhood, and the mask of pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn by this court, can stir them till they sting.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered, smiling scornfully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why fear? because that fostered at thy court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I savour of thy⁠—virtues? fear them? no.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Love, if Love is perfect, casts out fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So Hate, if Hate is perfect, casts out fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father died in battle against the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother on his corpse in open field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She bore me there, for born from death was I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the dead and sown upon the wind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then on thee! and shown the truth betimes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That old true filth, and bottom of the well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Truth is hidden. Gracious lessons thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maxims of the mud! ‘This Arthur pure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gives him the lie! There is no being pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?’⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy blessing, stainless King! I bring thee back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I have ferreted out their burrowings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hearts of all this Order in mine hand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay⁠—so that fate and craft and folly close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance, one curl of Arthur’s golden beard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is cleaner-fashioned⁠—Well, I loved thee first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That warps the wit.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Loud laughed the graceless Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low in the city, and on a festal day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Guinevere was crossing the great hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why kneel ye there? What evil hath ye wrought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise!” and the damsel bidden rise arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood with folded hands and downward eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My father died in battle for thy King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mother on his corpse⁠—in open field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonnesse⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor wretch⁠—no friend!⁠—and now by Mark the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that small charm of feature mine, pursued⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any such be mine⁠—I fly to thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save, save me thou⁠—Woman of women⁠—thine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wreath of beauty, thine the crown of power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be thine the balm of pity, O Heaven’s own white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Earth-angel, stainless bride of stainless King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Help, for he follows! take me to thyself!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O yield me shelter for mine innocency</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among thy maidens!”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Here her slow sweet eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt on her hearer’s, while the Queen who stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We choose the last. Our noble Arthur, him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—we believe all evil of thy Mark⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We go to prove it. Bide ye here the while.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She past; and Vivien murmured after “Go!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bide the while.” Then through the portal-arch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peering askance, and muttering broken-wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one that labours with an evil dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Is that the Lancelot? goodly⁠—ay, but gaunt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Courteous⁠—amends for gauntness⁠—takes her hand⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A clinging kiss⁠—how hand lingers in hand!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let go at last!⁠—they ride away⁠—to hawk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For waterfowl. Royaller game is mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For such a supersensual sensual bond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touch flax with flame⁠—a glance will serve⁠—the liars!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah little rat that borest in the dyke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down upon far-off cities while they dance⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or dream⁠—of thee they dreamed not⁠—nor of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These⁠—ay, but each of either: ride, and dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mortal dream that never yet was mine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ride, ride and dream until ye wake⁠—to me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will hate, loathe, fear⁠—but honour me the more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet while they rode together down the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their talk was all of training, terms of art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“She is too noble,” he said, “to check at pies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor will she rake: there is no baseness in her.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here when the Queen demanded as by chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Know ye the stranger woman?” “Let her be,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who pounced her quarry and slew it. Many a time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As once⁠—of old⁠—among the flowers⁠—they rode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whispered: through the peaceful court she crept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whispered: then as Arthur in the highest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arriving at a time of golden rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all the heathen lay at Arthur’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no quest came, but all was joust and play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leavened his hall. They heard and let her be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereafter as an enemy that has left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wily Vivien stole from Arthur’s court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She hated all the knights, and heard in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their lavish comment when her name was named.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For once, when Arthur walking all alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vext at a rumour issued from herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some corruption crept among his knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fluttered adoration, and at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than who should prize him most; at which the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one had watched, and had not held his peace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It made the laughter of an afternoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after that, she set herself to gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Him, the most famous man of all those times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people called him Wizard; whom at first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She played about with slight and sprightly talk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would watch her at her petulance, and play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perceiving that she was but half disdained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to break her sports with graver fits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn red or pale, would often when they met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would flatter his own wish in age for love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And half believe her true: for thus at times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wavered; but that other clung to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A doom that ever poised itself to fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ever-moaning battle in the mist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>World-war of dying flesh against the life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Death in all life and lying in all love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The meanest having power upon the highest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the high purpose broken by the worm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So leaving Arthur’s court he gained the beach;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There found a little boat, and stept into it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Vivien followed, but he marked her not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She took the helm and he the sail; the boat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then she followed Merlin all the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Merlin once had told her of a charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The which if any wrought on anyone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With woven paces and with waving arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which was no escape for evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none could find that man for evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming and going, and he lay as dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost to life and use and name and fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Vivien ever sought to work the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As fancying that her glory would be great</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to his greatness whom she quenched.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if in deepest reverence and in love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of samite without price, that more exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In colour like the satin-shining palm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On sallows in the windy gleams of March:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she kissed them, crying, “Trample me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will pay you worship; tread me down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will kiss you for it;” he was mute:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As on a dull day in an Ocean cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence: wherefore, when she lifted up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Merlin, do ye love me?” and again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Merlin, do ye love me?” and once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Great Master, do ye love me?” he was mute.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together, curved an arm about his neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made with her right a comb of pearl to part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lists of such a board as youth gone out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had left in ashes: then he spoke and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not looking at her, “Who are wise in love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love most, say least,” and Vivien answered quick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I saw the little elf-god eyeless once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s arras hall at Camelot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But neither eyes nor tongue⁠—O stupid child!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet you are wise who say it; let me think</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silence is wisdom: I am silent then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask no kiss;” then adding all at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom,” drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across her neck and bosom to her knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called herself a gilded summer fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught in a great old tyrant spider’s web,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without one word. So Vivien called herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rather seemed a lovely baleful star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To what request for what strange boon,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these have broken up my melancholy.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling saucily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bid the stranger welcome. Thanks at last!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But yesterday you never opened lip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except indeed to drink: no cup had we:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In mine own lady palms I culled the spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made a pretty cup of both my hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And offered you it kneeling: then you drank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O no more thanks than might a goat have given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With no more sign of reverence than a beard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when we halted at that other well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I was faint to swooning, and you lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet no thanks: and all through this wild wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all this morning when I fondled you:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But such a silence is more wise than kind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O did ye never lie upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch the curled white of the coming wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I rose and fled from Arthur’s court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To break the mood. You followed me unasked;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I looked, and saw you following me still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My mind involved yourself the nearest thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that mind-mist: for shall I tell you truth?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You seemed that wave about to break upon me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweep me from my hold upon the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My use and name and fame. Your pardon, child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your pretty sports have brightened all again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once for wrong done you by confusion, next</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thanks it seems till now neglected, last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these your dainty gambols: wherefore ask;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And take this boon so strange and not so strange.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O not so strange as my long asking it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The people call you prophet: let it be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not of those that can expound themselves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take Vivien for expounder; she will call</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No presage, but the same mistrustful mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes you seem less noble than yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever I have asked this very boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now asked again: for see you not, dear love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your fancy when ye saw me following you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must make me fear still more you are not mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make me wish still more to learn this charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of woven paces and of waving hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As proof of trust. O Merlin, teach it me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore be as great as ye are named,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not muffled round with selfish reticence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How hard you look and how denyingly!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, if you think this wickedness in me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I should prove it on you unawares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had best be loosed forever: but think or not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have tript on such conjectural treachery⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If I be such a traitress. Yield my boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And grant my re-reiterated wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great proof of your love: because I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However wise, ye hardly know me yet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I never was less wise, however wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than when I told you first of such a charm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too much I trusted when I told you that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stirred this vice in you which ruined man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through woman the first hour; for howsoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In children a great curiousness be well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who have to learn themselves and all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In you, that are no child, for still I find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your face is practised when I spell the lines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I call it⁠—well, I will not call it vice:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since you name yourself the summer fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That settles, beaten back, and beaten back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Settles, till one could yield for weariness:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since I will not yield to give you power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon my life and use and name and fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why will ye never ask some other boon?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, by God’s rood, I trusted you too much.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ever bided tryst at village stile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caress her: let her feel herself forgiven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who feels no heart to ask another boon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ‘trust me not at all or all in all.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And it shall answer for me. Listen to it.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Faith and unfaith can ne’er be equal powers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘It is the little rift within the lute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That by and by will make the music mute,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever widening slowly silence all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘The little rift within the lover’s lute</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rotting inward slowly moulders all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>‘It is not worth the keeping: let it go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And trust me not at all or all in all.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin looked and half believed her true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So tender was her voice, so fair her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet he answered half indignantly:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Far other was the song that once I heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chase a creature that was current then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It was the time when first the question rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the founding of a Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That was to be, for love of God and men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each incited each to noble deeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We could not keep him silent, out he flashed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And into such a song, such fire for fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such trumpet-glowings in it, coming down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To such a stern and iron-clashing close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And should have done it; but the beauteous beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a silver shadow slipt away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dim land; and all day long we rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the dim land against a rushing wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chased the flashes of his golden horns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till they vanished by the fairy well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That laughs at iron⁠—as our warriors did⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Laugh, little well!’ but touch it with a sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We lost him: such a noble song was that.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I felt as though you knew this cursed charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were proving it on me, and that I lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O mine have ebbed away for evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all through following you to this wild wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As high as woman in her selfless mood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touching fame, howe’er ye scorn my song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take one verse more⁠—the lady speaks it⁠—this:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So trust me not at all or all in all.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Says she not well? and there is more⁠—this rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But nevermore the same two sister pearls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her white neck⁠—so is it with this rhyme:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It lives dispersedly in many hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every minstrel sings it differently;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet is there one true line, the pearl of pearls:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea! Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A portion from the solid present, eats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know well that Envy calls you Devil’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since ye seem the Master of all Art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They fain would make you Master of all vice.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I once was looking for a magic weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found a fair young squire who sat alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then was painting on it fancied arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dexter chief; the scroll ‘I follow fame.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And speaking not, but leaning over him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I took his brush and blotted out the bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made a Gardener putting in a graff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With this for motto, ‘Rather use than fame.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>You should have seen him blush; but afterwards</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made a stalwart knight. O Vivien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For you, methinks you think you love me well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For me, I love you somewhat; rest: and Love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not ever be too curious for a boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too prurient for a proof against the grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of him ye say ye love: but Fame with men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being but ampler means to serve mankind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But work as vassal to the larger love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Increasing gave me use. Lo, there my boon!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What other? for men sought to prove me vile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I fain had given them greater wits:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then did Envy call me Devil’s son:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sick weak beast seeking to help herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By striking at her better, missed, and brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet were the days when I was all unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when my name was lifted up, the storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet needs must work my work. That other fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one at least, who hath not children, vague,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cackle of the unborn about the grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cared not for it: a single misty star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which is the second in a line of stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never gazed upon it but I dreamt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some vast charm concluded in that star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make fame nothing. Wherefore, if I fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Giving you power upon me through this charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you might play me falsely, having power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However well ye think ye love me now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(As sons of kings loving in pupilage</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rather dread the loss of use than fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If you⁠—and not so much from wickedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As some wild turn of anger, or a mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of overstrained affection, it may be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep me all to your own self⁠—or else</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sudden spurt of woman’s jealousy⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have I not sworn? I am not trusted. Good!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being found take heed of Vivien.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A woman and not trusted, doubtless I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might feel some sudden turn of anger born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is accurate too, for this full love of mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the full heart back may merit well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your term of overstrained. So used as I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My daily wonder is, I love at all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as to woman’s jealousy, O why not?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O to what end, except a jealous one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one to make me jealous if I love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was this fair charm invented by yourself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe that all about this world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which is no escape for evermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the great Master merrily answered her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Full many a love in loving youth was mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I needed then no charm to keep them mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But youth and love; and that full heart of yours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So live uncharmed. For those who wrought it first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who paced it, ages back: but will ye hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There lived a king in the most Eastern East,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Less old than I, yet older, for my blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tawny pirate anchored in his port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw two cities in a thousand boats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All fighting for a woman on the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pushing his black craft among them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With loss of half his people arrow-slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They said a light came from her when she moved:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since the pirate would not yield her up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King impaled him for his piracy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then made her Queen: but those isle-nurtured eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waged such unwilling though successful war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rustiest iron of old fighters’ hearts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What wonder, being jealous, that he sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horns of proclamation out through all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find a wizard who might teach the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might keep her all his own: to such a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He promised more than ever king has given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A league of mountain full of golden mines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A province with a hundred miles of coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A palace and a princess, all for him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But on all those who tried and failed, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To keep the list low and pretenders back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or like a king, not to be trifled with⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their heads should moulder on the city gates.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many tried and failed, because the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of nature in her overbore their own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many weeks a troop of carrion crows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy tongue has tript a little: ask thyself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lady never made unwilling war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With those fine eyes: she had her pleasure in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made her good man jealous with good cause.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lived there neither dame nor damsel then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth at a lover’s loss? were all as tame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, those were not our days: but did they find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A wizard? Tell me, was he like to thee?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On her new lord, her own, the first of men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He answered laughing, “Nay, not like to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last they found⁠—his foragers for charms⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little glassy-headed hairless man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Read but one book, and ever reading grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So grated down and filed away with thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard their voices talk behind the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And learnt their elemental secrets, powers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forces; often o’er the sun’s bright eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world to peace again: here was the man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so by force they dragged him to the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he taught the King to charm the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such-wise, that no man could see her more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming and going, and she lay as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost all use of life: but when the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made proffer of the league of golden mines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The province with a hundred miles of coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The palace and the princess, that old man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vanished, and his book came down to me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered smiling saucily:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ye have the book: the charm is written in it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Good: take my counsel: let me know it at once:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As after furious battle turfs the slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On some wild down above the windy deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I yet should strike upon a sudden means</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And smiling as a master smiles at one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That is not of his school, nor any school</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that where blind and naked Ignorance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On all things all day long, he answered her:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O ay, it is but twenty pages long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But every page having an ample marge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every marge enclosing in the midst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A square of text that looks a little blot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every square of text an awful charm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Writ in a language that has long gone by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So long, that mountains have arisen since</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With cities on their flanks⁠—thou read the book!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever margin scribbled, crost, and crammed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With comment, densest condensation, hard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my long life have made it easy to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none can read the text, not even I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none can read the comment but myself;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the comment did I find the charm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, the results are simple; a mere child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might use it to the harm of anyone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And never could undo it: ask no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though you should not prove it upon me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But keep that oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assay it on someone of the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all because ye dream they babble of you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What dare the full-fed liars say of me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They ride abroad redressing human wrongs!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They bound to holy vows of chastity!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But you are man, you well can understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shame that cannot be explained for shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not one of all the drove should touch me: swine!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Merlin careless of her words:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“You breathe but accusation vast and vague,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spleen-born, I think, and proofless. If ye know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose kinsman left him watcher o’er his wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was one year gone, and on returning found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one hour old! What said the happy sire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A seven-months’ babe had been a truer gift.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Merlin, “Nay, I know the tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One child they had: it lived with her: she died:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His kinsman travelling on his own affair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He brought, not found it therefore: take the truth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O ay,” said Vivien, “overtrue a tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ardent man? ‘to pluck the flower in season,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So says the song, ‘I trow it is no treason.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Master, shall we call him overquick</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin answered, “Overquick art thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is man’s good name: he never wronged his bride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know the tale. An angry gust of wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many-corridored complexities</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur’s palace: then he found a door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And darkling felt the sculptured ornament</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That wreathen round it made it seem his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wearied out made for the couch and slept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stainless man beside a stainless maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And either slept, nor knew of other there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Arthur’s casement glimmered chastely down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blushing upon them blushing, and at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He rose without a word and parted from her:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the thing was blazed about the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brute world howling forced them into bonds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as it chanced they are happy, being pure.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O ay,” said Vivien, “that were likely too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or some black wether of <abbr>St.</abbr> Satan’s fold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, in the precincts of the chapel-yard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the knightly brasses of the graves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Merlin answered careless of her charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A sober man is Percivale and pure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But once in life was flustered with new wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where one of Satan’s shepherdesses caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meant to stamp him with her master’s mark;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that he sinned is not believable;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, look upon his face!⁠—but if he sinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sin that practice burns into the blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To which he answered sadly, “Yea, I know it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rumour runs, she took him for the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fixt her fancy on him: let them be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But have ye no one word of loyal praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By which the good King means to blind himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blinds himself and all the Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the foulness that they work. Myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could call him (were it not for womanhood)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pretty, popular cause such manhood earns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could call him the main cause of all their crime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O true and tender! O my liege and King!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O selfless man and stainless gentleman,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have all men true and leal, all women pure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How, in the mouths of base interpreters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From over-fineness not intelligible</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To things with every sense as false and foul</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As the poached filth that floods the middle street,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By instance, recommenced, and let her tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rage like a fire among the noblest names,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Polluting, and imputing her whole self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Defaming and defacing, till she left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her words had issue other than she willed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And muttered in himself, “Tell her the charm!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, if she had it, would she rail on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To snare the next, and if she have it not</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So will she rail. What did the wanton say?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Not mount as high;’ we scarce can sink as low:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know the Table Round, my friends of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I well believe she tempted them and failed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so bitter: for fine plots may fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though harlots paint their talk as well as face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With colours of the heart that are not theirs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will not let her know: nine tithes of times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wanting the mental range; or low desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to feel lowest makes them level all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave an equal baseness; and in this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some stain or blemish in a name of note,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not grieving that their greatest are so small,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Inflate themselves with some insane delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And judge all nature from her feet of clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without the will to lift their eyes, and see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touching other worlds. I am weary of her.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-suffocated in the hoary fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hearing “harlot” muttered twice or thrice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How from the rosy lips of life and love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flashed the bare-grinning skeleton of death!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And feeling; had she found a dagger there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For in a wink the false love turns to hate)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eye was calm, and suddenly she took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bitter weeping like a beaten child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A long, long weeping, not consolable.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O crueller than was ever told in tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sung in song! O vainly lavished love!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or seeming shameful⁠—for what shame in love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So love be true, and not as yours is⁠—nothing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who called her what he called her⁠—all her crime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All⁠—all⁠—the wish to prove him wholly hers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She mused a little, and then clapt her hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Together with a wailing shriek, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Stabbed through the heart’s affections to the heart!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seethed like the kid in its own mother’s milk!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought that he was gentle, being great:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O God, that I had loved a smaller man!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I should have found in him a greater heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who loved to make men darker than they are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because of that high pleasure which I had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seat you sole upon my pedestal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of worship⁠—I am answered, and henceforth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The course of life that seemed so flowery to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With you for guide and master, only you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ending in a ruin⁠—nothing left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But into some low cave to crawl, and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Killed with inutterable unkindliness.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silence, while his anger slowly died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within him, till he let his wisdom go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ease of heart, and half believed her true:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called her to shelter in the hollow oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Come from the storm,” and having no reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last she let herself be conquered by him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the cageling newly flown returns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came to her old perch back, and settled there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About her, more in kindness than in love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she dislinked herself at once and rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upright and flushed before him: then she said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There must now be no passages of love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since, if I be what I am grossly called,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What should be granted which your own gross heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would reckon worth the taking? I will go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In truth, but one thing now⁠—better have died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrice than have asked it once⁠—could make me stay⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That proof of trust⁠—so often asked in vain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How justly, after that vile term of yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I find with grief! I might believe you then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows? once more. Lo! what was once to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vast necessity of heart and life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My fate or folly, passing gayer youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one so old, must be to love thee still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere I leave thee let me swear once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if I schemed against thy peace in this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May yon just heaven, that darkens o’er me, send</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One flash, that, missing all things else, may make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For now the storm was close above them) struck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With darted spikes and splinters of the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dark earth round. He raised his eyes and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That followed, flying back and crying out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Merlin, though you do not love me, save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet save me!” clung to him and hugged him close;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called him dear protector in her fright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pale blood of the wizard at her touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took gayer colours, like an opal warmed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She blamed herself for telling hearsay tales:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She shook from fear, and for her fault she wept</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of petulancy; she called him lord and liege,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her whole life; and ever overhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bellowed the tempest, and the rotten branch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Snapt in the rushing of the river-rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above them; and in change of glare and gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her eyes and neck glittering went and came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till now the storm, its burst of passion spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moaning and calling out of other lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had left the ravaged woodland yet once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To peace; and what should not have been had been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Merlin, overtalked and overworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of woven paces and of waving hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the hollow oak he lay as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lost to life and use and name and fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then crying “I have made his glory mine,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shrieking out “O fool!” the harlot leapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adown the forest, and the thicket closed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind her, and the forest echoed “fool.”</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Pelleas and Ettarre</h2>
			<p>
				<span>King Arthur made new knights to fill the gap</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left by the Holy Quest; and as he sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In hall at old Caerleon, the high doors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were softly sundered, and through these a youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pelleas, and the sweet smell of the fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past, and the sunshine came along with him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Make me thy knight, because I know, Sir King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All that belongs to knighthood, and I love.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such was his cry: for having heard the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had let proclaim a tournament⁠—the prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A golden circlet and a knightly sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full fain had Pelleas for his lady won</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden circlet, for himself the sword:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there were those who knew him near the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And promised for him: and Arthur made him knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this new knight, Sir Pelleas of the isles⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lately come to his inheritance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lord of many a barren isle was he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Riding at noon, a day or twain before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the forest called of Dean, to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caerleon and the King, had felt the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat like a strong knight on his helm, and reeled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Almost to falling from his horse; but saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near him a mound of even-sloping side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereon a hundred stately beeches grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here and there great hollies under them;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But for a mile all round was open space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fern and heath: and slowly Pelleas drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To that dim day, then binding his good horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To a tree, cast himself down; and as he lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At random looking over the brown earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through that green-glooming twilight of the grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seemed to Pelleas that the fern without</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burnt as a living fire of emeralds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that his eyes were dazzled looking at it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then o’er it crost the dimness of a cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Floating, and once the shadow of a bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, and then a fawn; and his eyes closed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since he loved all maidens, but no maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In special, half-awake he whispered, “Where?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O where? I love thee, though I know thee not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For fair thou art and pure as Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will make thee with my spear and sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As famous⁠—O my Queen, my Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I will be thine Arthur when we meet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Suddenly wakened with a sound of talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And laughter at the limit of the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glancing through the hoary boles, he saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strange as to some old prophet might have seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A vision hovering on a sea of fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damsels in divers colours like the cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sunset and sunrise, and all of them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On horses, and the horses richly trapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breast-high in that bright line of bracken stood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the damsels talked confusedly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was pointing this way, and one that,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the way was lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And Pelleas rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loosed his horse, and led him to the light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There she that seemed the chief among them said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“In happy time behold our pilot-star!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Youth, we are damsels-errant, and we ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed as ye see, to tilt against the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There at Caerleon, but have lost our way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To right? to left? straight forward? back again?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which? tell us quickly.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Pelleas gazing thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is Guinevere herself so beautiful?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For large her violet eyes looked, and her bloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rosy dawn kindled in stainless heavens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And round her limbs, mature in womanhood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And slender was her hand and small her shape;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And but for those large eyes, the haunts of scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have seemed a toy to trifle with,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pass and care no more. But while he gazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beauty of her flesh abashed the boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As though it were the beauty of her soul:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as the base man, judging of the good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Puts his own baseness in him by default</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of will and nature, so did Pelleas lend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the young beauty of his own soul to hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believing her; and when she spake to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stammered, and could not make her a reply.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For out of the waste islands had he come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where saving his own sisters he had known</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce any but the women of his isles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rough wives, that laughed and screamed against the gulls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makers of nets, and living from the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then with a slow smile turned the lady round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looked upon her people; and as when</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stone is flung into some sleeping tarn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circle widens till it lip the marge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spread the slow smile through all her company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three knights were thereamong; and they too smiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scorning him; for the lady was Ettarre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she was a great lady in her land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again she said, “O wild and of the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knowest thou not the fashion of our speech?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or have the Heavens but given thee a fair face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lacking a tongue?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“O damsel,” answered he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I woke from dreams; and coming out of gloom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was dazzled by the sudden light, and crave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pardon: but will ye to Caerleon? I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go likewise: shall I lead you to the King?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lead then,” she said; and through the woods they went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while they rode, the meaning in his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His tenderness of manner, and chaste awe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His broken utterances and bashfulness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were all a burthen to her, and in her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She muttered, “I have lighted on a fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raw, yet so stale!” But since her mind was bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On hearing, after trumpet blown, her name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And title, “Queen of Beauty,” in the lists</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried⁠—and beholding him so strong, she thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That peradventure he will fight for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And win the circlet: therefore flattered him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so gracious, that he wellnigh deemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His wish by hers was echoed; and her knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her damsels too were gracious to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For she was a great lady.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And when they reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caerleon, ere they past to lodging, she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taking his hand, “O the strong hand,” she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“See! look at mine! but wilt thou fight for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And win me this fine circlet, Pelleas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I may love thee?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then his helpless heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leapt, and he cried, “Ay! wilt thou if I win?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, that will I,” she answered, and she laughed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And straitly nipt the hand, and flung it from her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then glanced askew at those three knights of hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all her ladies laughed along with her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O happy world,” thought Pelleas, “all, meseems,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are happy; I the happiest of them all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor slept that night for pleasure in his blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And green wood-ways, and eyes among the leaves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then being on the morrow knighted, sware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To love one only. And as he came away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The men who met him rounded on their heels</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wondered after him, because his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shone like the countenance of a priest of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against the flame about a sacrifice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kindled by fire from heaven: so glad was he.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur made vast banquets, and strange knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the four winds came in: and each one sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though served with choice from air, land, stream, and sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oft in mid-banquet measuring with his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His neighbour’s make and might: and Pelleas looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noble among the noble, for he dreamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His lady loved him, and he knew himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loved of the King: and him his new-made knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worshipt, whose lightest whisper moved him more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all the ranged reasons of the world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then blushed and brake the morning of the jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this was called “The Tournament of Youth:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Arthur, loving his young knight, withheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His older and his mightier from the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Pelleas might obtain his lady’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>According to her promise, and remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lord of the tourney. And Arthur had the jousts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down in the flat field by the shore of Usk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holden: the gilded parapets were crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With faces, and the great tower filled with eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up to the summit, and the trumpets blew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There all day long Sir Pelleas kept the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With honour: so by that strong hand of his</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sword and golden circlet were achieved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rang the shout his lady loved: the heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of pride and glory fired her face; her eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sparkled; she caught the circlet from his lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there before the people crowned herself:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So for the last time she was gracious to him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then at Caerleon for a space⁠—her look</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright for all others, cloudier on her knight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lingered Ettarre: and seeing Pelleas droop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Guinevere, “We marvel at thee much,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O damsel, wearing this unsunny face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To him who won thee glory!” And she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Had ye not held your Lancelot in your bower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My Queen, he had not won.” Whereat the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As one whose foot is bitten by an ant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced down upon her, turned and went her way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But after, when her damsels, and herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those three knights all set their faces home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Pelleas followed. She that saw him cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Damsels⁠—and yet I should be shamed to say it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot bide Sir Baby. Keep him back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among yourselves. Would rather that we had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some rough old knight who knew the worldly way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit grizzlier than a bear, to ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And jest with: take him to you, keep him off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pamper him with papmeat, if ye will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old milky fables of the wolf and sheep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as the wholesome mothers tell their boys.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, should ye try him with a merry one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find his mettle, good: and if he fly us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Small matter! let him.” This her damsels heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mindful of her small and cruel hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They, closing round him through the journey home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Acted her hest, and always from her side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Restrained him with all manner of device,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that he could not come to speech with her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she gained her castle, upsprang the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down rang the grate of iron through the groove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he was left alone in open field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“These be the ways of ladies,” Pelleas thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“To those who love them, trials of our faith.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, let her prove me to the uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For loyal to the uttermost am I.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So made his moan; and darkness falling, sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A priory not far off, there lodged, but rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With morning every day, and, moist or dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full-armed upon his charger all day long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat by the walls, and no one opened to him.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this persistence turned her scorn to wrath.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then calling her three knights, she charged them, “Out!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drive him from the walls.” And out they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Pelleas overthrew them as they dashed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against him one by one; and these returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But still he kept his watch beneath the wall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereon her wrath became a hate; and once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A week beyond, while walking on the walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her three knights, she pointed downward, “Look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He haunts me⁠—I cannot breathe⁠—besieges me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down! strike him! put my hate into your strokes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And drive him from my walls.” And down they went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Pelleas overthrew them one by one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the tower above him cried Ettarre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Bind him, and bring him in.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>He heard her voice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then let the strong hand, which had overthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her minion-knights, by those he overthrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be bounden straight, and so they brought him in.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then when he came before Ettarre, the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her rich beauty made him at one glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More bondsman in his heart than in his bonds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet with good cheer he spake, “Behold me, Lady,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A prisoner, and the vassal of thy will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if thou keep me in thy donjon here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Content am I so that I see thy face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But once a day: for I have sworn my vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou hast given thy promise, and I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all these pains are trials of my faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that thyself, when thou hast seen me strained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sifted to the utmost, wilt at length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yield me thy love and know me for thy knight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she began to rail so bitterly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all her damsels, he was stricken mute;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when she mocked his vows and the great King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lighted on words: “For pity of thine own self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace, Lady, peace: is he not thine and mine?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou fool,” she said, “I never heard his voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But longed to break away. Unbind him now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrust him out of doors; for save he be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool to the midmost marrow of his bones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He will return no more.” And those, her three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laughed, and unbound, and thrust him from the gate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And after this, a week beyond, again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She called them, saying, “There he watches yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There like a dog before his master’s door!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Kicked, he returns: do ye not hate him, ye?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye know yourselves: how can ye bide at peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Affronted with his fulsome innocence?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are ye but creatures of the board and bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No men to strike? Fall on him all at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if ye slay him I reck not: if ye fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give ye the slave mine order to be bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind him as heretofore, and bring him in:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It may be ye shall slay him in his bonds.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake; and at her will they couched their spears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three against one: and Gawain passing by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound upon solitary adventure, saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low down beneath the shadow of those towers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A villainy, three to one: and through his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fire of honour and all noble deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flashed, and he called, “I strike upon thy side⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The caitiffs!” “Nay,” said Pelleas, “but forbear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He needs no aid who doth his lady’s will.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Gawain, looking at the villainy done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forbore, but in his heat and eagerness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trembled and quivered, as the dog, withheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A moment from the vermin that he sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him, shivers, ere he springs and kills.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Pelleas overthrew them, one to three;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they rose up, and bound, and brought him in.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then first her anger, leaving Pelleas, burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full on her knights in many an evil name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of craven, weakling, and thrice-beaten hound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yet, take him, ye that scarce are fit to touch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far less to bind, your victor, and thrust him out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let who will release him from his bonds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if he comes again”⁠—there she brake short;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Pelleas answered, “Lady, for indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I loved you and I deemed you beautiful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot brook to see your beauty marred</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through evil spite: and if ye love me not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot bear to dream you so forsworn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I had liefer ye were worthy of my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than to be loved again of you⁠—farewell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though ye kill my hope, not yet my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vex not yourself: ye will not see me more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While thus he spake, she gazed upon the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of princely bearing, though in bonds, and thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why have I pushed him from me? this man loves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If love there be: yet him I loved not. Why?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I deemed him fool? yea, so? or that in him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A something⁠—was it nobler than myself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed my reproach? He is not of my kind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He could not love me, did he know me well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, let him go⁠—and quickly.” And her knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laughed not, but thrust him bounden out of door.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forth sprang Gawain, and loosed him from his bonds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flung them o’er the walls; and afterward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shaking his hands, as from a lazar’s rag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Faith of my body,” he said, “and art thou not⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea thou art he, whom late our Arthur made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knight of his table; yea and he that won</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circlet? wherefore hast thou so defamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy brotherhood in me and all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As let these caitiffs on thee work their will?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Pelleas answered, “O, their wills are hers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For whom I won the circlet; and mine, hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus to be bounden, so to see her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Marred though it be with spite and mockery now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Other than when I found her in the woods;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though she hath me bounden but in spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all to flout me, when they bring me in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me be bounden, I shall see her face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else must I die through mine unhappiness.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Gawain answered kindly though in scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why, let my lady bind me if she will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let my lady beat me if she will:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But an she send her delegate to thrall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These fighting hands of mine⁠—Christ kill me then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I will slice him handless by the wrist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And let my lady sear the stump for him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Howl as he may. But hold me for your friend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, ye know nothing: here I pledge my troth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, by the honour of the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will be leal to thee and work thy work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tame thy jailing princess to thine hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lend me thine horse and arms, and I will say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I have slain thee. She will let me in</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear the manner of thy fight and fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when I come within her counsels, then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From prime to vespers will I chant thy praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As prowest knight and truest lover, more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any have sung thee living, till she long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To have thee back in lusty life again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be bound, save by white bonds and warm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dearer than freedom. Wherefore now thy horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armour: let me go: be comforted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me three days to melt her fancy, and hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The third night hence will bring thee news of gold.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Pelleas lent his horse and all his arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saving the goodly sword, his prize, and took</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gawain’s, and said, “Betray me not, but help⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou not he whom men call light-of-love?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay,” said Gawain, “for women be so light.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then bounded forward to the castle walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And raised a bugle hanging from his neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And winded it, and that so musically</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the old echoes hidden in the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rang out like hollow woods at hunting-tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Up ran a score of damsels to the tower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Avaunt,” they cried, “our lady loves thee not.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Gawain lifting up his vizor said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Gawain am I, Gawain of Arthur’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I have slain this Pelleas whom ye hate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold his horse and armour. Open gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will make you merry.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>And down they ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her damsels, crying to their lady, “Lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pelleas is dead⁠—he told us⁠—he that hath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horse and armour: will ye let him in?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He slew him! Gawain, Gawain of the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Gawain⁠—there he waits below the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blowing his bugle as who should say him nay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so, leave given, straight on through open door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode Gawain, whom she greeted courteously.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Dead, is it so?” she asked. “Ay, ay,” said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And oft in dying cried upon your name.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Pity on him,” she answered, “a good knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But never let me bide one hour at peace.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay,” thought Gawain, “and you be fair enow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But I to your dead man have given my troth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whom ye loathe, him will I make you love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So those three days, aimless about the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost in a doubt, Pelleas wandering</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waited, until the third night brought a moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With promise of large light on woods and ways.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hot was the night and silent; but a sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Gawain ever coming, and this lay⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which Pelleas had heard sung before the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seen her sadden listening⁠—vext his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And marred his rest⁠—“A worm within the rose.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A rose, but one, none other rose had I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rose, one rose, and this was wondrous fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One rose, a rose that gladdened earth and sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One rose, my rose, that sweetened all mine air⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cared not for the thorns; the thorns were there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One rose, a rose to gather by and by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One rose, a rose, to gather and to wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No rose but one⁠—what other rose had I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One rose, my rose; a rose that will not die⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He dies who loves it⁠—if the worm be there.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This tender rhyme, and evermore the doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why lingers Gawain with his golden news?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So shook him that he could not rest, but rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ere midnight to her walls, and bound his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard by the gates. Wide open were the gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no watch kept; and in through these he past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard but his own steps, and his own heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beating, for nothing moved but his own self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And his own shadow. Then he crost the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spied not any light in hall or bower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But saw the postern portal also wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yawning; and up a slope of garden, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of roses white and red, and brambles mixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overgrowing them, went on, and found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here too, all hushed below the mellow moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that one rivulet from a tiny cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came lightening downward, and so spilt itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the roses, and was lost again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then was he ware of three pavilions reared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the bushes, gilden-peakt: in one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red after revel, droned her lurdane knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slumbering, and their three squires across their feet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In one, their malice on the placid lip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frozen by sweet sleep, four of her damsels lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the third, the circlet of the jousts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound on her brow, were Gawain and Ettarre.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Back, as a hand that pushes through the leaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find a nest and feels a snake, he drew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back, as a coward slinks from what he fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cope with, or a traitor proven, or hound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beaten, did Pelleas in an utter shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Creep with his shadow through the court again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fingering at his sword-handle until he stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There on the castle-bridge once more, and thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will go back, and slay them where they lie.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so went back, and seeing them yet in sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said, “Ye, that so dishallow the holy sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your sleep is death,” and drew the sword, and thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What! slay a sleeping knight? the King hath bound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sworn me to this brotherhood;” again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas that ever a knight should be so false.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then turned, and so returned, and groaning laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The naked sword athwart their naked throats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There left it, and them sleeping; and she lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The circlet of her tourney round her brows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sword of the tourney across her throat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And forth he past, and mounting on his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stared at her towers that, larger than themselves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their own darkness, thronged into the moon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then crushed the saddle with his thighs, and clenched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hands, and maddened with himself and moaned:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Would they have risen against me in their blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At the last day? I might have answered them</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even before high God. O towers so strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Huge, solid, would that even while I gaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The crack of earthquake shivering to your base</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Split you, and Hell burst up your harlot roofs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bellowing, and charred you through and through within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Black as the harlot’s heart⁠—hollow as a skull!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the fierce east scream through your eyelet-holes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whirl the dust of harlots round and round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In dung and nettles! hiss, snake⁠—I saw him there⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the fox bark, let the wolf yell. Who yells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in the still sweet summer night, but I⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, the poor Pelleas whom she called her fool?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool, beast⁠—he, she, or I? myself most fool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beast too, as lacking human wit⁠—disgraced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dishonoured all for trial of true love⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love?⁠—we be all alike: only the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath made us fools and liars. O noble vows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O great and sane and simple race of brutes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That own no lust because they have no law!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For why should I have loved her to my shame?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I loathe her, as I loved her to my shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I never loved her, I but lusted for her⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Away⁠—”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>He dashed the rowel into his horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bounded forth and vanished through the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then she, that felt the cold touch on her throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awaking knew the sword, and turned herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Gawain: “Liar, for thou hast not slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Pelleas! here he stood, and might have slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me and thyself.” And he that tells the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Says that her ever-veering fancy turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Pelleas, as the one true knight on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And only lover; and through her love her life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wasted and pined, desiring him in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But he by wild and way, for half the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over hard and soft, striking the sod</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From out the soft, the spark from off the hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode till the star above the wakening sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside that tower where Percivale was cowled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced from the rosy forehead of the dawn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so the words were flashed into his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knew not whence or wherefore: “O sweet star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pure on the virgin forehead of the dawn!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he would have wept, but felt his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harder and drier than a fountain bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In summer: thither came the village girls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lingered talking, and they come no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the sweet heavens have filled it from the heights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again with living waters in the change</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of seasons: hard his eyes; harder his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed; but so weary were his limbs, that he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gasping, “Of Arthur’s hall am I, but here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here let me rest and die,” cast himself down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gulfed his griefs in inmost sleep; so lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till shaken by a dream, that Gawain fired</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hall of Merlin, and the morning star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reeled in the smoke, brake into flame, and fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He woke, and being ware of someone nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent hands upon him, as to tear him, crying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“False! and I held thee pure as Guinevere.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Percivale stood near him and replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Am I but false as Guinevere is pure?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or art thou mazed with dreams? or being one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our free-spoken Table hast not heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Lancelot”⁠—there he checked himself and paused.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fared it with Sir Pelleas as with one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who gets a wound in battle, and the sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made it plunges through the wound again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pricks it deeper: and he shrank and wailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is the Queen false?” and Percivale was mute.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Have any of our Round Table held their vows?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Percivale made answer not a word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Is the King true?” “The King!” said Percivale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Why then let men couple at once with wolves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What! art thou mad?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>But Pelleas, leaping up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran through the doors and vaulted on his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fled: small pity upon his horse had he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or on himself, or any, and when he met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cripple, one that held a hand for alms⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hunched as he was, and like an old dwarf-elm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That turns its back upon the salt blast, the boy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paused not, but overrode him, shouting, “False,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And false with Gawain!” and so left him bruised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And battered, and fled on, and hill and wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went ever streaming by him till the gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That follows on the turning of the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darkened the common path: he twitched the reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made his beast that better knew it, swerve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now off it and now on; but when he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High up in heaven the hall that Merlin built,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blackening against the dead-green stripes of even,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Black nest of rats,” he groaned, “ye build too high.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not long thereafter from the city gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Issued Sir Lancelot riding airily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Warm with a gracious parting from the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Peace at his heart, and gazing at a star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And marvelling what it was: on whom the boy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the silent seeded meadow-grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Borne, clashed: and Lancelot, saying, “What name hast thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ridest here so blindly and so hard?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“No name, no name,” he shouted, “a scourge am I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lash the treasons of the Table Round.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, but thy name?” “I have many names,” he cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I am wrath and shame and hate and evil fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a poisonous wind I pass to blast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blaze the crime of Lancelot and the Queen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“First over me,” said Lancelot, “shalt thou pass.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fight therefore,” yelled the youth, and either knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew back a space, and when they closed, at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The weary steed of Pelleas floundering flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His rider, who called out from the dark field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art as false as Hell: slay me: I have no sword.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Lancelot, “Yea, between thy lips⁠—and sharp;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But here I will disedge it by thy death.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Slay then,” he shrieked, “my will is to be slain,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot, with his heel upon the fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolling his eyes, a moment stood, then spake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Rise, weakling; I am Lancelot; say thy say.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Lancelot slowly rode his warhorse back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Camelot, and Sir Pelleas in brief while</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught his unbroken limbs from the dark field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And followed to the city. It chanced that both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake into hall together, worn and pale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There with her knights and dames was Guinevere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full wonderingly she gazed on Lancelot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So soon returned, and then on Pelleas, him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who had not greeted her, but cast himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on a bench, hard-breathing. “Have ye fought?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She asked of Lancelot. “Ay, my Queen,” he said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And hast thou overthrown him?” “Ay, my Queen.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she, turning to Pelleas, “O young knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath the great heart of knighthood in thee failed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So far thou canst not bide, unfrowardly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fall from him?” Then, for he answered not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Or hast thou other griefs? If I, the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May help them, loose thy tongue, and let me know.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Pelleas lifted up an eye so fierce</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She quailed; and he, hissing “I have no sword,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang from the door into the dark. The Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked hard upon her lover, he on her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each foresaw the dolorous day to be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all talk died, as in a grove all song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the shadow of some bird of prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then a long silence came upon the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Modred thought, “The time is hard at hand.”</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Coming of Arthur</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had one fair daughter, and none other child;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guinevere, and in her his one delight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For many a petty king ere Arthur came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each upon other, wasted all the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still from time to time the heathen host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein the beast was ever more and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But man was less and less, till Arthur came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after him King Uther fought and died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But either failed to make the kingdom one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after these King Arthur for a space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through the puissance of his Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew all their petty princedoms under him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none or few to scare or chase the beast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that wild dog, and wolf and boar and bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wallowed in the gardens of the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever and anon the wolf would steal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The children and devour, but now and then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To human sucklings; and the children, housed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mock their foster mother on four feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till, straightened, they grew up to wolf-like men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worse than the wolves. And King Leodogran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Groaned for the Roman legions here again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Caesar’s eagle: then his brother king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Urien, assailed him: last a heathen horde,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the spike that split the mother’s heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He knew not whither he should turn for aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But⁠—for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though not without an uproar made by those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who cried, “He is not Uther’s son”⁠—the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent to him, saying, “Arise, and help us thou!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For here between the man and beast we die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But heard the call, and came: and Guinevere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since he neither wore on helm or shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden symbol of his kinglihood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rode a simple knight among his knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many of these in richer arms than he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One among many, though his face was bare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur, looking downward as he past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt the light of her eyes into his life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His tents beside the forest. Then he drave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forest, letting in the sun, and made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so returned.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>For while he lingered there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flashed forth and into war: for most of these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made head against him, crying, “Who is he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he should rule us? who hath proven him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Uther’s son? for lo! we look at him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is the son of Gorlois, not the King;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is the son of Anton, not the King.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thinking as he rode, “Her father said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That there between the man and beast they die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up to my throne, and side by side with me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What happiness to reign a lonely king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vext⁠—O ye stars that shudder over me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O earth that soundest hollow under me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To her that is the fairest under heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seem as nothing in the mighty world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cannot will my will, nor work my work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Victor and lord. But were I joined with her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then might we live together as one life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reigning with one will in everything</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have power on this dark land to lighten it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And power on this dead world to make it live.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereafter⁠—as he speaks who tells the tale⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was all so clear about him, that he saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even in high day the morning star.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So when the King had set his banner broad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long-lanced battle let their horses run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now the King, as here and there that war</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made lightnings and great thunders over him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mightier of his hands with every blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leading all his knighthood threw the kings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Carados, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King Brandagoras of Latangor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lot of Orkney. Then, before a voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As dreadful as the shout of one who sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one who sins, and deems himself alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hacked among the flyers, “Ho! they yield!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So like a painted battle the war stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And honoured most. “Thou dost not doubt me King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir and my liege,” he cried, “the fire of God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descends upon thee in the battle-field:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know thee for my King!” Whereat the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For each had warded either in the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware on the field of death a deathless love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur said, “Man’s word is God in man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then quickly from the foughten field he sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, “If I in aught have served thee well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Debating⁠—“How should I that am a king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However much he holp me at my need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give my one daughter saving to a king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a king’s son?”⁠—lifted his voice, and called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He trusted all things, and of him required</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His counsel: “Knowest thou aught of Arthur’s birth?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir King, there be but two old men that know:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each is twice as old as I; and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Uther through his magic art; and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is Merlin’s master (so they call him) Bleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All things and whatsoever Merlin did</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In one great annal-book, where after-years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will learn the secret of our Arthur’s birth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the King Leodogran replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O friend, had I been holpen half as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By this King Arthur as by thee today,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then beast and man had had their share of me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But summon here before us yet once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, when they came before him, the King said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reason in the chase: but wherefore now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some calling Arthur born of Gorlois,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others of Anton? Tell me, ye yourselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther’s son?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Ulfius and Brastias answered, “Ay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For bold in heart and act and word was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whenever slander breathed against the King⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sir, there be many rumours on this head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there be those who hate him in their hearts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there be those who deem him more than man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dream he dropt from heaven: but my belief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In all this matter⁠—so ye care to learn⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir, for ye know that in King Uther’s time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prince and warrior Gorlois, he that held</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And daughters had she borne him⁠—one whereof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lot’s wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Arthur⁠—but a son she had not borne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she, a stainless wife to Gorlois,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Gorlois and King Uther went to war:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And overthrown was Gorlois and slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there was none to call to but himself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So, compassed by the power of the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with a shameful swiftness: afterward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not many moons, King Uther died himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that same night, the night of the new year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By reason of the bitterness and grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That vext his mother, all before his time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delivered at a secret postern-gate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Merlin, to be holden far apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until his hour should come; because the lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sought to rule for his own self and hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many hated Uther for the sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Gorlois. Wherefore Merlin took the child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And no man knew. And ever since the lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the realm has gone to wrack: but now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proclaiming, ‘Here is Uther’s heir, your king,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred voices cried, ‘Away with him!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No king of ours! a son of Gorlois he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else the child of Anton, and no king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else baseborn.’ Yet Merlin through his craft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while the people clamoured for a king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Banded, and so brake out in open war.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then while the King debated with himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or born the son of Gorlois, after death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Uther’s son, and born before his time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether there were truth in anything</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lot’s wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom as he could, not as he would, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye come from Arthur’s court. Victor his men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Report him! Yea, but ye⁠—think ye this king⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many those that hate him, and so strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So few his knights, however brave they be⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O King,” she cried, “and I will tell thee: few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I was near him when the savage yells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Uther’s peerage died, and Arthur sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowned on the dais, and his warriors cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Be thou the king, and we will work thy will</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love thee.’ Then the King in low deep tones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And simple words of great authority,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were pale as at the passing of a ghost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some flushed, and others dazed, as one who wakes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-blinded at the coming of a light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But when he spake and cheered his Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With large, divine, and comfortable words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond my tongue to tell thee⁠—I beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From eye to eye through all their Order flash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A momentary likeness of the King:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ere it left their faces, through the cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those around it and the Crucified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down from the casement over Arthur, smote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One falling upon each of three fair queens,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hundred winters are but as the hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows a subtler magic than his own⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby to drive the heathen out: a mist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of incense curled about her, and her face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But there was heard among the holy hymns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice as of the waters, for she dwells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There likewise I beheld Excalibur</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him at his crowning borne, the sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That rose from out the bosom of the lake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur rowed across and took it⁠—rich</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bewildering heart and eye⁠—the blade so bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That men are blinded by it⁠—on one side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Take me,’ but turn the blade and ye shall see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And written in the speech ye speak yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Cast me away!’ And sad was Arthur’s face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taking it, but old Merlin counselled him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Take thou and strike! the time to cast away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is yet far-off.’ So this great brand the king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sift his doubtings to the last, and asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixing full eyes of question on her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The swallow and the swift are near akin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou art closer to this noble prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being his own dear sister;” and she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Daughter of Gorlois and Ygerne am I;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And therefore Arthur’s sister?” asked the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She answered, “These be secret things,” and signed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To those two sons to pass, and let them be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gawain went, and breaking into song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang out, and followed by his flying hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there half-heard; the same that afterward</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then the Queen made answer, “What know I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was Gorlois, yea and dark was Uther too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wellnigh to blackness; but this King is fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the race of Britons and of men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moreover, always in my mind I hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cry from out the dawning of my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mother weeping, and I hear her say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O that ye had some brother, pretty one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To guard thee on the rough ways of the world.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay,” said the King, “and hear ye such a cry?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O King!” she cried, “and I will tell thee true:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found me first when yet a little maid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beaten I had been for a little fault</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flung myself down on a bank of heath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hated this fair world and all therein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wept, and wished that I were dead; and he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not whether of himself he came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unseen at pleasure⁠—he was at my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dried my tears, being a child with me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a time he came, and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I grew greater grew with me; and sad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At times he seemed, and sad with him was I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sweet again, and then I loved him well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now of late I see him less and less,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But those first days had golden hours for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For then I surely thought he would be king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But let me tell thee now another tale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Bleys, our Merlin’s master, as they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear him speak before he left his life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I entered told me that himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Merlin ever served about the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Uther, before he died; and on the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When Uther in Tintagil past away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then from the castle gateway by the chasm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descending through the dismal night⁠—a night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright with a shining people on the decks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gone as soon as seen. And then the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the wave and in the flame was borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A naked babe, and rode to Merlin’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried ‘The King!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here is an heir for Uther!’ And the fringe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all at once all round him rose in fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the child and he were clothed in fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presently thereafter followed calm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free sky and stars: ‘And this the same child,’ he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till this were told.’ And saying this the seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not ever to be questioned any more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save on the further side; but when I met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shining dragon and the naked child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descending in the glory of the seas⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He laughed as is his wont, and answered me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In riddling triplets of old time, and said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A young man will be wiser by and by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An old man’s wit may wander ere he die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And truth is this to me, and that to thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And truth or clothed or naked let it be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the great deep to the great deep he goes.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So Merlin riddling angered me; but thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fear not to give this King thy only child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Guinevere: so great bards of him will sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And echoed by old folk beside their fires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For comfort after their wage-work is done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though men may wound him that he will not die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But pass, again to come; and then or now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Utterly smite the heathen underfoot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till these and all men hail him for their king.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But musing, “Shall I answer yea or nay?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Doubted, and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Field after field, up to a height, the peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now looming, and now lost; and on the slope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streamed to the peak, and mingled with the haze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made it thicker; while the phantom king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent out at times a voice; and here or there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slew on and burnt, crying, “No king of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No son of Uther, and no king of ours;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Descended, and the solid earth became</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowned. And Leodogran awoke, and sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ulfius, and Brastias and Bedivere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bring the Queen;⁠—and watched him from the gates:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot past away among the flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For then was latter April) and returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chief of the church in Britain, and before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That morn was married, while in stainless white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fair beginners of a nobler time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glorying in their vows and him, his knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood around him, and rejoicing in his joy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far shone the fields of May through open door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sacred altar blossomed white with May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Sun of May descended on their King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They gazed on all earth’s beauty in their Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice as of the waters, while the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur said, “Behold, thy doom is mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“King and my lord, I love thee to the death!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all this Order of thy Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In scornful stillness gazing as they past;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then while they paced a city all on fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur’s knighthood sang before the King:⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Blow, trumpet, for the world is white with May;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow through the living world⁠—‘Let the King reign.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur’s realm?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That God hath told the King a secret word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King is King, and ever wills the highest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clang battleaxe, and clash brand! Let the King reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The King will follow Christ, and we the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall battleaxe, and flash brand! Let the King reign.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slowly-fading mistress of the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strode in, and claimed their tribute as of yore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur spake, “Behold, for these have sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wage my wars, and worship me their King;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old order changeth, yielding place to new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we that fight for our fair father Christ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No tribute will we pay:” so those great lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Arthur and his knighthood for a space</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were all one will, and through that strength the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew in the petty princedoms under him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Holy Grail</h2>
			<p>
				<span>From noiseful arms, and acts of prowess done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In tournament or tilt, Sir Percivale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Arthur and his knighthood called The Pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had passed into the silent life of prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Praise, fast, and alms; and leaving for the cowl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The helmet in an abbey far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Camelot, there, and not long after, died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And one, a fellow-monk among the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambrosius, loved him much beyond the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And honoured him, and wrought into his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A way by love that wakened love within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To answer that which came: and as they sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a world-old yew-tree, darkening half</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cloisters, on a gustful April morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That puffed the swaying branches into smoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above them, ere the summer when he died</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The monk Ambrosius questioned Percivale:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O brother, I have seen this yew-tree smoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spring after spring, for half a hundred years:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For never have I known the world without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever strayed beyond the pale: but thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first thou camest⁠—such a courtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake through the limbs and in the voice⁠—I knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one of those who eat in Arthur’s hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For good ye are and bad, and like to coins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some true, some light, but every one of you</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stamped with the image of the King; and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, what drove thee from the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brother? was it earthly passion crost?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay,” said the knight; “for no such passion mine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the sweet vision of the Holy Grail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove me from all vainglories, rivalries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And earthly heats that spring and sparkle out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among us in the jousts, while women watch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who wins, who falls; and waste the spiritual strength</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Within us, better offered up to Heaven.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the monk: “The Holy Grail!⁠—I trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We are green in Heaven’s eyes; but here too much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We moulder⁠—as to things without I mean⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet one of your own knights, a guest of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told us of this in our refectory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But spake with such a sadness and so low</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We heard not half of what he said. What is it?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The phantom of a cup that comes and goes?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, monk! what phantom?” answered Percivale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drank at the last sad supper with his own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This, from the blessed land of Aromat⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the day of darkness, when the dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went wandering o’er Moriah⁠—the good saint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arimathaean Joseph, journeying brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Glastonbury, where the winter thorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there awhile it bode; and if a man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could touch or see it, he was healed at once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By faith, of all his ills. But then the times</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew to such evil that the holy cup</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was caught away to Heaven, and disappeared.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the monk: “From our old books I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Joseph came of old to Glastonbury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the heathen Prince, Arviragus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there he built with wattles from the marsh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little lonely church in days of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so they say, these books of ours, but seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mute of this miracle, far as I have read.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But who first saw the holy thing today?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A woman,” answered Percivale, “a nun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one no further off in blood from me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than sister; and if ever holy maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With knees of adoration wore the stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A holy maid; though never maiden glowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that was in her earlier maidenhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a fervent flame of human love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which being rudely blunted, glanced and shot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to holy things; to prayer and praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She gave herself, to fast and alms. And yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nun as she was, the scandal of the Court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sin against Arthur and the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the strange sound of an adulterous race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the iron grating of her cell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat, and she prayed and fasted all the more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And he to whom she told her sins, or what</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her all but utter whiteness held for sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A man wellnigh a hundred winters old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake often with her of the Holy Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A legend handed down through five or six,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each of these a hundred winters old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From our Lord’s time. And when King Arthur made</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His Table Round, and all men’s hearts became</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clean for a season, surely he had thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That now the Holy Grail would come again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sin broke out. Ah, Christ, that it would come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heal the world of all their wickedness!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O Father!’ asked the maiden, ‘might it come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me by prayer and fasting?’ ‘Nay,’ said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I know not, for thy heart is pure as snow.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so she prayed and fasted, till the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shone, and the wind blew, through her, and I thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She might have risen and floated when I saw her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For on a day she sent to speak with me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she came to speak, behold her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond my knowing of them, beautiful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all knowing of them, wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beautiful in the light of holiness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ‘O my brother Percivale,’ she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a silver horn from o’er the hills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blown, and I thought, “It is not Arthur’s use</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hunt by moonlight;” and the slender sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As from a distance beyond distance grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coming upon me⁠—O never harp nor horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was like that music as it came; and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With rosy colours leaping on the wall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then the music faded, and the Grail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past, and the beam decayed, and from the walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rosy quiverings died into the night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So now the Holy Thing is here again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That so perchance the vision may be seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By thee and those, and all the world be healed.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then leaving the pale nun, I spake of this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all men; and myself fasted and prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always, and many among us many a week</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fasted and prayed even to the uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Expectant of the wonder that would be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And one there was among us, ever moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among us in white armour, Galahad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘God make thee good as thou art beautiful,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Arthur, when he dubbed him knight; and none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In so young youth, was ever made a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Galahad; and this Galahad, when he heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sister’s vision, filled me with amaze;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His eyes became so like her own, they seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hers, and himself her brother more than I.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sister or brother none had he; but some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Called him a son of Lancelot, and some said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Begotten by enchantment⁠—chatterers they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like birds of passage piping up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gape for flies⁠—we know not whence they come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when was Lancelot wanderingly lewd?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But she, the wan sweet maiden, shore away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which made a silken mat-work for her feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of this she plaited broad and long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A strong sword-belt, and wove with silver thread</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crimson in the belt a strange device,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A crimson grail within a silver beam;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw the bright boy-knight, and bound it on him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, ‘My knight, my love, my knight of heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O thou, my love, whose love is one with mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go forth, for thou shalt see what I have seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And break through all, till one will crown thee king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the spiritual city:’ and as she spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She sent the deathless passion in her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through him, and made him hers, and laid her mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On him, and he believed in her belief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then came a year of miracle: O brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In our great hall there stood a vacant chair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fashioned by Merlin ere he past away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And carven with strange figures; and in and out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The figures, like a serpent, ran a scroll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of letters in a tongue no man could read.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Merlin called it ‘The Siege perilous,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perilous for good and ill; ‘for there,’ he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘No man could sit but he should lose himself:’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once by misadvertence Merlin sat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Galahad, when he heard of Merlin’s doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried, ‘If I lose myself, I save myself!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then on a summer night it came to pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While the great banquet lay along the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Galahad would sit down in Merlin’s chair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And all at once, as there we sat, we heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cracking and a riving of the roofs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rending, and a blast, and overhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thunder, and in the thunder was a cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the blast there smote along the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A beam of light seven times more clear than day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All over covered with a luminous cloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And none might see who bare it, and it past.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But every knight beheld his fellow’s face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in a glory, and all the knights arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And staring each at other like dumb men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I sware a vow before them all, that I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because I had not seen the Grail, would ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A twelvemonth and a day in quest of it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until I found and saw it, as the nun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sister saw it; and Galahad sware the vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And good Sir Bors, our Lancelot’s cousin, sware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot sware, and many among the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Gawain sware, and louder than the rest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the monk Ambrosius, asking him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What said the King? Did Arthur take the vow?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, for my lord,” said Percivale, “the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was not in hall: for early that same day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An outraged maiden sprang into the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying on help: for all her shining hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was smeared with earth, and either milky arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red-rent with hooks of bramble, and all she wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In tempest: so the King arose and went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made such honey in his realm. Howbeit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some little of this marvel he too saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Returning o’er the plain that then began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To darken under Camelot; whence the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked up, calling aloud, ‘Lo, there! the roofs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our great hall are rolled in thunder-smoke!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray Heaven, they be not smitten by the bolt.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For dear to Arthur was that hall of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As having there so oft with all his knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Feasted, and as the stateliest under heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O brother, had you known our mighty hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which Merlin built for Arthur long ago!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all the sacred mount of Camelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the dim rich city, roof by roof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tower after tower, spire beyond spire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By grove, and garden-lawn, and rushing brook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Climbs to the mighty hall that Merlin built.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And four great zones of sculpture, set betwixt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With many a mystic symbol, gird the hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the lowest beasts are slaying men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the second men are slaying beasts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the third are warriors, perfect men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the fourth are men with growing wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over all one statue in the mould</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur, made by Merlin, with a crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And peaked wings pointed to the Northern Star.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And eastward fronts the statue, and the crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And both the wings are made of gold, and flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At sunrise till the people in far fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wasted so often by the heathen hordes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold it, crying, ‘We have still a King.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, brother, had you known our hall within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broader and higher than any in all the lands!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where twelve great windows blazon Arthur’s wars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the light that falls upon the board</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streams through the twelve great battles of our King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, one there is, and at the eastern end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Arthur finds the brand Excalibur.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And also one to the west, and counter to it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blank: and who shall blazon it? when and how?⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O there, perchance, when all our wars are done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brand Excalibur will be cast away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So to this hall full quickly rode the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In horror lest the work by Merlin wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreamlike, should on the sudden vanish, wrapt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in he rode, and up I glanced, and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden dragon sparkling over all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many of those who burnt the hold, their arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hacked, and their foreheads grimed with smoke, and seared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed, and in among bright faces, ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of the vision, prest: and then the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake to me, being nearest, ‘Percivale,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Because the hall was all in tumult⁠—some</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vowing, and some protesting), ‘what is this?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O brother, when I told him what had chanced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My sister’s vision, and the rest, his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darkened, as I have seen it more than once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When some brave deed seemed to be done in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Darken; and ‘Woe is me, my knights,’ he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Had I been here, ye had not sworn the vow.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bold was mine answer, ‘Had thyself been here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My King, thou wouldst have sworn.’ ‘Yea, yea,’ said he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Art thou so bold and hast not seen the Grail?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Nay, lord, I heard the sound, I saw the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since I did not see the Holy Thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I sware a vow to follow it till I saw.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then when he asked us, knight by knight, if any</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had seen it, all their answers were as one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Nay, lord, and therefore have we sworn our vows.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Lo now,’ said Arthur, ‘have ye seen a cloud?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What go ye into the wilderness to see?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then Galahad on the sudden, and in a voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrilling along the hall to Arthur, called,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘But I, Sir Arthur, saw the Holy Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw the Holy Grail and heard a cry⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O Galahad, and O Galahad, follow me.” ’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Ah, Galahad, Galahad,’ said the King, ‘for such</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou art is the vision, not for these.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy holy nun and thou have seen a sign⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holier is none, my Percivale, than she⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sign to maim this Order which I made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ye, that follow but the leader’s bell’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Brother, the King was hard upon his knights)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Taliessin is our fullest throat of song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one hath sung and all the dumb will sing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot is Lancelot, and hath overborne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Five knights at once, and every younger knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unproven, holds himself as Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till overborne by one, he learns⁠—and ye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What are ye? Galahads?⁠—no, nor Percivales’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For thus it pleased the King to range me close</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After Sir Galahad); ‘nay,’ said he, ‘but men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With strength and will to right the wronged, of power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lay the sudden heads of violence flat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Knights that in twelve great battles splashed and dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The strong White Horse in his own heathen blood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But one hath seen, and all the blind will see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go, since your vows are sacred, being made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet⁠—for ye know the cries of all my realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass through this hall⁠—how often, O my knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your places being vacant at my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This chance of noble deeds will come and go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unchallenged, while ye follow wandering fires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost in the quagmire! Many of you, yea most,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Return no more: ye think I show myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too dark a prophet: come now, let us meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The morrow morn once more in one full field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of gracious pastime, that once more the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before ye leave him for this Quest, may count</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The yet-unbroken strength of all his knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoicing in that Order which he made.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So when the sun broke next from under ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the great table of our Arthur closed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clashed in such a tourney and so full,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many lances broken⁠—never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Camelot seen the like, since Arthur came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I myself and Galahad, for a strength</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was in us from this vision, overthrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many knights that all the people cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And almost burst the barriers in their heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shouting, ‘Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But when the next day brake from under ground⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O brother, had you known our Camelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built by old kings, age after age, so old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King himself had fears that it would fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strange, and rich, and dim; for where the roofs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tottered toward each other in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Met foreheads all along the street of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who watched us pass; and lower, and where the long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rich galleries, lady-laden, weighed the necks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of dragons clinging to the crazy walls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thicker than drops from thunder, showers of flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell as we past; and men and boys astride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On wyvern, lion, dragon, griffin, swan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At all the corners, named us each by name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling, ‘God speed!’ but in the ways below</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The knights and ladies wept, and rich and poor</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wept, and the King himself could hardly speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For grief, and all in middle street the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who rode by Lancelot, wailed and shrieked aloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘This madness has come on us for our sins.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So to the Gate of the three Queens we came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where Arthur’s wars are rendered mystically,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thence departed every one his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I was lifted up in heart, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all my late-shown prowess in the lists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How my strong lance had beaten down the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So many and famous names; and never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had heaven appeared so blue, nor earth so green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all my blood danced in me, and I knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I should light upon the Holy Grail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thereafter, the dark warning of our King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That most of us would follow wandering fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came like a driving gloom across my mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then every evil word I had spoken once,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every evil thought I had thought of old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every evil deed I ever did,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Awoke and cried, ‘This Quest is not for thee.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifting up mine eyes, I found myself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone, and in a land of sand and thorns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I was thirsty even unto death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, too, cried, ‘This Quest is not for thee.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And on I rode, and when I thought my thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would slay me, saw deep lawns, and then a brook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one sharp rapid, where the crisping white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Played ever back upon the sloping wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took both ear and eye; and o’er the brook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were apple-trees, and apples by the brook</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fallen, and on the lawns. ‘I will rest here,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I said, ‘I am not worthy of the Quest;’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But even while I drank the brook, and ate</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The goodly apples, all these things at once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into dust, and I was left alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thirsting, in a land of sand and thorns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And then behold a woman at a door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spinning; and fair the house whereby she sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kind the woman’s eyes and innocent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her bearing gracious; and she rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Rest here;’ but when I touched her, lo! she, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into dust and nothing, and the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Became no better than a broken shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in it a dead babe; and also this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into dust, and I was left alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And on I rode, and greater was my thirst.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then flashed a yellow gleam across the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And where it smote the plowshare in the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The plowman left his plowing, and fell down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before it; where it glittered on her pail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The milkmaid left her milking, and fell down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before it, and I knew not why, but thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘The sun is rising,’ though the sun had risen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then was I ware of one that on me moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In golden armour with a crown of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About a casque all jewels; and his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In golden armour jewelled everywhere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the splendour came, flashing me blind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seemed to me the Lord of all the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so huge. But when I thought he meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To crush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened his arms to embrace me as he came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up I went and touched him, and he, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into dust, and I was left alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wearying in a land of sand and thorns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I rode on and found a mighty hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the top, a city walled: the spires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by the gateway stirred a crowd; and these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cried to me climbing, ‘Welcome, Percivale!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou mightiest and thou purest among men!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glad was I and clomb, but found at top</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No man, nor any voice. And thence I past</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far through a ruinous city, and I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That man had once dwelt there; but there I found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only one man of an exceeding age.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Where is that goodly company,’ said I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘That so cried out upon me?’ and he had</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarce any voice to answer, and yet gasped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Whence and what art thou?’ and even as he spoke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was left alone once more, and cried in grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Lo, if I find the Holy Grail itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And touch it, it will crumble into dust.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And thence I dropt into a lowly vale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low as the hill was high, and where the vale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was lowest, found a chapel, and thereby</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A holy hermit in a hermitage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom I told my phantoms, and he said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘O son, thou hast not true humility,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The highest virtue, mother of them all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the Lord of all things made Himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Naked of glory for His mortal change,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Take thou my robe,” she said, “for all is thine,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her form shone forth with sudden light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that the angels were amazed, and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed Him down, and like a flying star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Led on the gray-haired wisdom of the east;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But her thou hast not known: for what is this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As Galahad.’ When the hermit made an end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silver armour suddenly Galahad shone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before us, and against the chapel door</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid lance, and entered, and we knelt in prayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the hermit slaked my burning thirst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And at the sacring of the mass I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The holy elements alone; but he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Saw ye no more? I, Galahad, saw the Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Holy Grail, descend upon the shrine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw the fiery face as of a child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That smote itself into the bread, and went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hither am I come; and never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath what thy sister taught me first to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This Holy Thing, failed from my side, nor come</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Covered, but moving with me night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fainter by day, but always in the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood-red, and sliding down the blackened marsh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood-red, and on the naked mountain top</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood-red, and in the sleeping mere below</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blood-red. And in the strength of this I rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shattering all evil customs everywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past through Pagan realms, and made them mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clashed with Pagan hordes, and bore them down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And broke through all, and in the strength of this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come victor. But my time is hard at hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hence I go; and one will crown me king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the spiritual city; and come thou, too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou shalt see the vision when I go.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One with him, to believe as he believed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, when the day began to wane, we went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There rose a hill that none but man could climb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scarred with a hundred wintry water-courses⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Storm at the top, and when we gained it, storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round us and death; for every moment glanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His silver arms and gloomed: so quick and thick</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lightnings here and there to left and right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck, till the dry old trunks about us, dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, rotten with a hundred years of death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang into fire: and at the base we found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On either hand, as far as eye could see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A great black swamp and of an evil smell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Part black, part whitened with the bones of men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be crost, save that some ancient king</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had built a way, where, linked with many a bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thousand piers ran into the great Sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Galahad fled along them bridge by bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every bridge as quickly as he crost</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sprang into fire and vanished, though I yearned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To follow; and thrice above him all the heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shoutings of all the sons of God: and first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At once I saw him far on the great Sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silver-shining armour starry-clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er his head the Holy Vessel hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with exceeding swiftness ran the boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If boat it were⁠—I saw not whence it came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the heavens opened and blazed again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Roaring, I saw him like a silver star⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And had he set the sail, or had the boat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Become a living creature clad with wings?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er his head the Holy Vessel hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Redder than any rose, a joy to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now I knew the veil had been withdrawn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then in a moment when they blazed again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Opening, I saw the least of little stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on the waste, and straight beyond the star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw the spiritual city and all her spires</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gateways in a glory like one pearl⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No larger, though the goal of all the saints⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which never eyes on earth again shall see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how my feet recrost the deathful ridge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No memory in me lives; but that I touched</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chapel-doors at dawn I know; and thence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taking my warhorse from the holy man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glad that no phantom vext me more, returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whence I came, the gate of Arthur’s wars.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O brother,” asked Ambrosius⁠—“for in sooth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These ancient books⁠—and they would win thee⁠—teem,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only I find not there this Holy Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With miracles and marvels like to these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not all unlike; which oftentime I read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who read but on my breviary with ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And almost plastered like a martin’s nest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these old walls⁠—and mingle with our folk;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knowing every honest face of theirs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As well as ever shepherd knew his sheep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every homely secret in their hearts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delight myself with gossip and old wives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ills and aches, and teethings, lyings-in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mirthful sayings, children of the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That have no meaning half a league away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or lulling random squabbles when they rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chafferings and chatterings at the market-cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O brother, saving this Sir Galahad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came ye on none but phantoms in your quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No man, no woman?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Then Sir Percivale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“All men, to one so bound by such a vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And women were as phantoms. O, my brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How far I faltered from my quest and vow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For after I had lain so many nights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bedmate of the snail and eft and snake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In grass and burdock, I was changed to wan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meagre, and the vision had not come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then I chanced upon a goodly town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With one great dwelling in the middle of it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thither I made, and there was I disarmed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By maidens each as fair as any flower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when they led me into hall, behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Princess of that castle was the one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother, and that one only, who had ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made my heart leap; for when I moved of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A slender page about her father’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she a slender maiden, all my heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went after her with longing: yet we twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had never kissed a kiss, or vowed a vow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now I came upon her once again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one had wedded her, and he was dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his land and wealth and state were hers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while I tarried, every day she set</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A banquet richer than the day before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By me; for all her longing and her will</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was toward me as of old; till one fair morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I walking to and fro beside a stream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That flashed across her orchard underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her castle-walls, she stole upon my walk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And calling me the greatest of all knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Embraced me, and so kissed me the first time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave herself and all her wealth to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I remembered Arthur’s warning word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That most of us would follow wandering fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the Quest faded in my heart. Anon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heads of all her people drew to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With supplication both of knees and tongue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘We have heard of thee: thou art our greatest knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our Lady says it, and we well believe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wed thou our Lady, and rule over us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou shalt be as Arthur in our land.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O me, my brother! but one night my vow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burnt me within, so that I rose and fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But wailed and wept, and hated mine own self,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And even the Holy Quest, and all but her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then after I was joined with Galahad</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cared not for her, nor anything upon earth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said the monk, “Poor men, when yule is cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Must be content to sit by little fires.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this am I, so that ye care for me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever so little; yea, and blest be Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That brought thee here to this poor house of ours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where all the brethren are so hard, to warm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My cold heart with a friend: but O the pity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find thine own first love once more⁠—to hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or all but hold, and then⁠—cast her aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foregoing all her sweetness, like a weed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we that want the warmth of double life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We that are plagued with dreams of something sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all sweetness in a life so rich⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, blessed Lord, I speak too earthlywise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing I never strayed beyond the cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But live like an old badger in his earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With earth about him everywhere, despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All fast and penance. Saw ye none beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>None of your knights?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Yea so,” said Percivale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“One night my pathway swerving east, I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The pelican on the casque of our Sir Bors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in the middle of the rising moon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toward him spurred, and hailed him, and he me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And each made joy of either; then he asked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Where is he? hast thou seen him⁠—Lancelot?⁠—Once,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said good Sir Bors, ‘he dashed across me⁠—mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maddening what he rode: and when I cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ridest thou then so hotly on a quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So holy,” Lancelot shouted, “Stay me not!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have been the sluggard, and I ride apace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now there is a lion in the way.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So vanished.’</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“Then Sir Bors had ridden on</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Softly, and sorrowing for our Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because his former madness, once the talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scandal of our table, had returned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot’s kith and kin so worship him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ill to him is ill to them; to Bors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the rest: he well had been content</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to have seen, so Lancelot might have seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Holy Cup of healing; and, indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being so clouded with his grief and love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Small heart was his after the Holy Quest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If God would send the vision, well: if not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Quest and he were in the hands of Heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And found a people there among their crags,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our race and blood, a remnant that were left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paynim amid their circles, and the stones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They pitch up straight to heaven: and their wise men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were strong in that old magic which can trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this high Quest as at a simple thing:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told him he followed⁠—almost Arthur’s words⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A mocking fire: ‘what other fire than he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when his answer chafed them, the rough crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hearing he had a difference with their priests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seized him, and bound and plunged him into a cell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of great piled stones; and lying bounden there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In darkness through innumerable hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He heard the hollow-ringing heavens sweep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over him till by miracle⁠—what else?⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heavy as it was, a great stone slipt and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such as no wind could move: and through the gap</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glimmered the streaming scud: then came a night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Still as the day was loud; and through the gap</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The seven clear stars of Arthur’s Table Round⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, brother, so one night, because they roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through such a round in heaven, we named the stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoicing in ourselves and in our King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these, like bright eyes of familiar friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In on him shone: ‘And then to me, to me,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said good Sir Bors, ‘beyond all hopes of mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the seven clear stars⁠—O grace to me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In colour like the fingers of a hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before a burning taper, the sweet Grail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glided and past, and close upon it pealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sharp quick thunder.’ Afterwards, a maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who kept our holy faith among her kin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In secret, entering, loosed and let him go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the monk: “And I remember now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That pelican on the casque: Sir Bors it was</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who spake so low and sadly at our board;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And mighty reverent at our grace was he:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A square-set man and honest; and his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An out-door sign of all the warmth within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smiled with his lips⁠—a smile beneath a cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But heaven had meant it for a sunny one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, Sir Bors, who else? But when ye reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The city, found ye all your knights returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or was there sooth in Arthur’s prophecy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell me, and what said each, and what the King?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then answered Percivale: “And that can I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother, and truly; since the living words</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of so great men as Lancelot and our King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass not from door to door and out again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But sit within the house. O, when we reached</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The city, our horses stumbling as they trode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On heaps of ruin, hornless unicorns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cracked basilisks, and splintered cockatrices,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shattered talbots, which had left the stones</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raw, that they fell from, brought us to the hall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And there sat Arthur on the dais-throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those that had gone out upon the Quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wasted and worn, and but a tithe of them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And those that had not, stood before the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, when he saw me, rose, and bad me hail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, ‘A welfare in thine eye reproves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our fear of some disastrous chance for thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On hill, or plain, at sea, or flooding ford.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fierce a gale made havoc here of late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the strange devices of our kings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, shook this newer, stronger hall of ours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the statue Merlin moulded for us</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-wrenched a golden wing; but now⁠—the Quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This vision⁠—hast thou seen the Holy Cup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Joseph brought of old to Glastonbury?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So when I told him all thyself hast heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ambrosius, and my fresh but fixt resolve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pass away into the quiet life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He answered not, but, sharply turning, asked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Gawain, ‘Gawain, was this Quest for thee?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Nay, lord,’ said Gawain, ‘not for such as I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Therefore I communed with a saintly man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who made me sure the Quest was not for me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I was much awearied of the Quest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But found a silk pavilion in a field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And merry maidens in it; and then this gale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tore my pavilion from the tenting-pin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blew my merry maidens all about</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all discomfort; yea, and but for this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He ceased; and Arthur turned to whom at first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw not, for Sir Bors, on entering, pushed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Athwart the throng to Lancelot, caught his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held it, and there, half-hidden by him, stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until the King espied him, saying to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Hail, Bors! if ever loyal man and true</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could see it, thou hast seen the Grail;’ and Bors,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Ask me not, for I may not speak of it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw it;’ and the tears were in his eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then there remained but Lancelot, for the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake but of sundry perils in the storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perhaps, like him of Cana in Holy Writ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our Arthur kept his best until the last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Thou, too, my Lancelot,’ asked the king, ‘my friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our mightiest, hath this Quest availed for thee?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Our mightiest!’ answered Lancelot, with a groan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O King!’⁠—and when he paused, methought I spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dying fire of madness in his eyes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Happier are those that welter in their sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swine in the mud, that cannot see for slime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slime of the ditch: but in me lived a sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And poisonous grew together, each as each,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware, I sware with them only in the hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could I touch or see the Holy Grail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They might be plucked asunder. Then I spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To one most holy saint, who wept and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That save they could be plucked asunder, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I would work according as he willed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To tear the twain asunder in my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My madness came upon me as of old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whipt me into waste fields far away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There was I beaten down by little men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shadow of my spear had been enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To scare them from me once; and then I came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in my folly to the naked shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wide flats, where nothing but coarse grasses grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But such a blast, my King, began to blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So loud a blast along the shore and sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye could not hear the waters for the blast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drove like a cataract, and all the sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were shaken with the motion and the sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in my madness to myself I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will embark and I will lose myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the great sea wash away my sin.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven days I drove along the dreary deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with me drove the moon and all the stars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wind fell, and on the seventh night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I heard the shingle grinding in the surge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A castle like a rock upon a rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With chasm-like portals open to the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And steps that met the breaker! there was none</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood near it but a lion on each side</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That kept the entry, and the moon was full.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There drew my sword. With sudden-flaring manes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those two great beasts rose upright like a man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will tear thee piecemeal.” Then with violence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And up into the sounding hall I past;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But nothing in the sounding hall I saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No bench nor table, painting on the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But always in the quiet house I heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear as a lark, high o’er me as a lark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the eastward: up I climbed a thousand steps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With pain: as in a dream I seemed to climb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forever: at the last I reached a door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A light was in the crannies, and I heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Glory and joy and honour to our Lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then in my madness I essayed the door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a fierceness that I swooned away⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All palled in crimson samite, and around</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And but for all my madness and my sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And covered; and this Quest was not for me.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So speaking, and here ceasing, Lancelot left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hall long silent, till Sir Gawain⁠—nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brother, I need not tell thee foolish words⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A reckless and irreverent knight was he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now boldened by the silence of his King⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well, I will tell thee: ‘O King, my liege,’ he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Hath Gawain failed in any quest of thine?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When have I stinted stroke in foughten field?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But as for thine, my good friend Percivale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy holy nun and thou have driven men mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, made our mightiest madder than our least.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But by mine eyes and by mine ears I swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will be deafer than the blue-eyed cat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thrice as blind as any noonday owl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To holy virgins in their ecstasies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Henceforward.’</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>“ ‘Deafer,’ said the blameless King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Gawain, and blinder unto holy things</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hope not to make thyself by idle vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being too blind to have desire to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if indeed there came a sign from heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blessed are Bors, Lancelot and Percivale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For these have seen according to their sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For every fiery prophet in old times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the sacred madness of the bard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When God made music through them, could but speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His music by the framework and the chord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as ye saw it ye have spoken truth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Nay⁠—but thou errest, Lancelot: never yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could all of true and noble in knight and man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Twine round one sin, whatever it might be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With such a closeness, but apart there grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that he were the swine thou spakest of,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some root of knighthood and pure nobleness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereto see thou, that it may bear its flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And spake I not too truly, O my knights?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was I too dark a prophet when I said</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To those who went upon the Holy Quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That most of them would follow wandering fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost in the quagmire?⁠—lost to me and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left me gazing at a barren board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And a lean Order⁠—scarce returned a tithe⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of those to whom the vision came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My greatest hardly will believe he saw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another hath beheld it afar off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cares but to pass into the silent life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one hath had the vision face to face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now his chair desires him here in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>However they may crown him otherwhere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And some among you held, that if the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not easily, seeing that the King must guard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That which he rules, and is but as the hind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom a space of land is given to plow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who may not wander from the allotted field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his work be done; but, being done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let visions of the night or of the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, as they will; and many a time they come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This air that smites his forehead is not air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But vision⁠—yea, his very hand and foot⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In moments when he feels he cannot die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And knows himself no vision to himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the high God a vision, nor that One</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who rose again: ye have seen what ye have seen.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So spake the King: I knew not all he meant.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made mock-knight of Arthur’s Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from the crown thereof a carcanet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came Tristram, saying, “Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far down beneath a winding wall of rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clutched at the crag, and started through mid air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bearing an eagle’s nest: and through the tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rushed ever a rainy wind, and through the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pierced ever a child’s cry: and crag and tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all unscarred from beak or talon, brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Received, and after loved it tenderly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And named it Nestling; so forgot herself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A moment, and her cares; till that young life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past from her; and in time the carcanet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom the King, “Peace to thine eagle-borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dead nestling, and this honour after death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Would rather you had let them fall,” she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Plunge and be lost⁠—ill-fated as they were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bitterness to me!⁠—ye look amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not knowing they were lost as soon as given⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above the river⁠—that unhappy child</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With these rich jewels, seeing that they came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the sweet body of a maiden babe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance⁠—who knows?⁠—the purest of thy knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May win them for the purest of my maids.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She ended, and the cry of a great jousts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From Camelot in among the faded fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Armed for a day of glory before the King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But on the hither side of that loud morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the hall staggered, his visage ribbed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one with shattered fingers dangling lame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A churl, to whom indignantly the King,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Man was it who marred heaven’s image in thee thus?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pitch-blackened sawing the air, said the maimed churl,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He took them and he drave them to his tower⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some hold he was a table-knight of thine⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A hundred goodly ones⁠—the Red Knight, he⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when I called upon thy name as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That doest right by gentle and by churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Maimed me and mauled, and would outright have slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that he sware me to a message, saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have founded my Round Table in the North,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whatsoever his own knights have sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knights have sworn the counter to it⁠—and say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My tower is full of harlots, like his court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mine are worthier, seeing they profess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be none other than themselves⁠—and say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knights are all adulterers like his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But mine are truer, seeing they profess</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be none other; and say his hour is come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen are upon him, his long lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur turned to Kay the seneschal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a king’s heir, till all his hurts be whole.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen⁠—but that ever-climbing wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hurled back again so often in empty foam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath lain for years at rest⁠—and renegades,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Friends, through your manhood and your fealty⁠—now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make their last head like Satan in the North.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enchaired tomorrow, arbitrate the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only to yield my Queen her own again?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereto Sir Lancelot answered, “It is well:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet better if the King abide, and leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The leading of his younger knights to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Else, for the King has willed it, it is well.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Arthur rose and Lancelot followed him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while they stood without the doors, the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned to him saying, “Is it then so well?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of whom was written, ‘A sound is in his ears’?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The foot that loiters, bidden go⁠—the glance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That only seems half-loyal to command⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A manner somewhat fallen from reverence⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or have I dreamed the bearing of our knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whence the fear lest this my realm, upreared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By noble deeds at one with noble vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From flat confusion and brute violences,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reel back into the beast, and be no more?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down the slope city rode, and sharply turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>North by the gate. In her high bower the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watched her lord pass, and knew not that she sighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of bygone Merlin, “Where is he who knows?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the great deep to the great deep he goes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the morning of a tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By these in earnest those in mockery called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The words of Arthur flying shrieked, arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down a streetway hung with folds of pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White samite, and by fountains running wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where children sat in white with cups of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He glanced and saw the stately galleries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dame, damsel, each through worship of their Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White-robed in honour of the stainless child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some with scattered jewels, like a bank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked but once, and vailed his eyes again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all the goodlier guests are past away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat their great umpire, looking o’er the lists.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He saw the laws that ruled the tournament</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before his throne of arbitration cursed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dead babe and the follies of the King;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once the laces of a helmet cracked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed him, like a vermin in its hole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice that billowed round the barriers roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But newly-entered, taller than the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And armoured all in forest green, whereon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ever-scattering berries, and on shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A spear, a harp, a bugle⁠—Tristram⁠—late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From overseas in Brittany returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And marriage with a princess of that realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Isolt the White⁠—Sir Tristram of the Woods⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His own against him, and now yearned to shake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The burthen off his heart in one full shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Tristram even to death: his strong hands gript</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until he groaned for wrath⁠—so many of those,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That ware their ladies’ colours on the casque,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there with gibes and flickering mockeries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stood, while he muttered, “Craven crests! O shame!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What faith have these in whom they sware to love?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The glory of our Round Table is no more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not speaking other word than “Hast thou won?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherewith thou takest this, is red!” to whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot’s languorous mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, “Ay, but wherefore toss me this</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest be thy fair Queen’s fantasy. Strength of heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are winners in this pastime of our King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My hand⁠—belike the lance hath dript upon it⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right arm of Arthur in the battle-field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram round the gallery made his horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caracole; then bowed his homage, bluntly saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Fair damsels, each to him who worships each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And most of these were mute, some angered, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Murmuring, “All courtesy is dead,” and one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The glory of our Round Table is no more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went glooming down in wet and weariness:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But under her black brows a swarthy one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laughed shrilly, crying, “Praise the patient saints,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our one white day of Innocence hath past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The snowdrop only, flowering through the year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come⁠—let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Lancelot’s, at this night’s solemnity</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the kindlier colours of the field.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So dame and damsel glittered at the feast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Variously gay: for he that tells the tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Likened them, saying, as when an hour of cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass under white, till the warm hour returns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So dame and damsel cast the simple white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glowing in all colours, the live grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About the revels, and with mirth so loud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tristram saying, “Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wheeled round on either heel, Dagonet replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Belike for lack of wiser company;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or being fool, and seeing too much wit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To know myself the wisest knight of all.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, fool,” said Tristram, “but ’tis eating dry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dance without a catch, a roundelay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dance to.” Then he twangled on his harp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while he twangled little Dagonet stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quiet as any water-sodden log</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stayed in the wandering warble of a brook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when the twangling ended, skipt again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being asked, “Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, “I had liefer twenty years</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Skip to the broken music of my brains</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any broken music thou canst make.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good now, what music have I broken, fool?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And little Dagonet, skipping, “Arthur, the King’s;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou makest broken music with thy bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her daintier namesake down in Brittany⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so thou breakest Arthur’s music too.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Save for that broken music in thy brains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Fool,” said Tristram, “I would break thy head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool, I came too late, the heathen wars were o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The life had flown, we sware but by the shell⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am but a fool to reason with a fool⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, thou art crabbed and sour: but lean me down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses’ ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And harken if my music be not true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Free love⁠—free field⁠—we love but while we may:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woods are hushed, their music is no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New leaf, new life⁠—the days of frost are o’er:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New life, new love, to suit the newer day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New loves are sweet as those that went before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Free love⁠—free field⁠—we love but while we may.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heard it ring as true as tested gold.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made to run wine?⁠—but this had run itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All out like a long life to a sour end⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And them that round it sat with golden cups</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hand the wine to whosoever came⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In honour of poor Innocence the babe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lent to the King, and Innocence the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gave for a prize⁠—and one of those white slips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Drink, drink, Sir Fool,’ and thereupon I drank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spat⁠—pish⁠—the cup was gold, the draught was mud.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, “Was it muddier than thy gibes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Fear God: honour the King⁠—his one true knight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sole follower of the vows’⁠—for here be they</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knew thee swine enow before I came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A naked aught⁠—yet swine I hold thee still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lieu of hers, I’ll hold thou hast some touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swine? I have wallowed, I have washed⁠—the world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is flesh and shadow⁠—I have had my day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath fouled me⁠—an I wallowed, then I washed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have had my day and my philosophies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thank the Lord I am King Arthur’s fool.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On such a wire as musically as thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some such fine song⁠—but never a king’s fool.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, “Then were swine, goats, asses, geese</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had such a mastery of his mystery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he could harp his wife up out of hell.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And whither harp’st thou thine? down! and thyself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That harpest downward! Dost thou know the star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, “Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glorying in each new glory, set his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Dagonet answered, “Ay, and when the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To babble about him, all to show your wit⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whether he were King by courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or King by right⁠—and so went harping down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The black king’s highway, got so far, and grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So witty that ye played at ducks and drakes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Arthur’s vows on the great lake of fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay, fool,” said Tristram, “not in open day.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Dagonet, “Nay, nor will: I see it and hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It makes a silent music up in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then we skip.” “Lo, fool,” he said, “ye talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fool’s treason: is the King thy brother fool?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conceits himself as God that he can make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And men from beasts⁠—Long live the king of fools!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And down the city Dagonet danced away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But through the slowly-mellowing avenues</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And solitary passes of the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ruby-circled neck, but evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all that walked, or crept, or perched, or flew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unruffling waters re-collect the shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one that in them sees himself, returned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or even a fallen feather, vanished again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So on for all that day from lawn to lawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through many a league-long bower he rode. At length</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Furze-crammed, and bracken-rooft, the which himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Against a shower, dark in the golden grove</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Appearing, sent his fancy back to where</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With six or seven, when Tristram was away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snatched her thence; yet dreading worse than shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But could not rest for musing how to smoothe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But then what folly had sent him overseas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After she left him lonely here? a name?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was it the name of one in Brittany,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Isolt, the daughter of the King? “Isolt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the white hands” they called her: the sweet name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allured him first, and then the maid herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who served him well with those white hands of hers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved him well, until himself had thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He loved her also, wedded easily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But left her all as easily, and returned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had drawn him home⁠—what marvel? then he laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He seemed to pace the strand of Brittany</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed them both the ruby-chain, and both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to struggle for it, till his Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then cried the Breton, “Look, her hand is red!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And melts within her hand⁠—her hand is hot</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is all as cool and white as any flower.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Followed a rush of eagle’s wings, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A whimpering of the spirit of the child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the twain had spoiled her carcanet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He dreamed; but Arthur with a hundred spears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rode far, till o’er the illimitable reed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wide-winged sunset of the misty marsh</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glared on a huge machicolated tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stood with open doors, whereout was rolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A roar of riot, as from men secure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Lo there,” said one of Arthur’s youth, for there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High on a grim dead tree before the tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A goodly brother of the Table Round</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At that dishonour done the gilded spur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Arthur waved them back. Alone he rode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sent the face of all the marsh aloft</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The woman-worshipper? Yea, God’s curse, and I!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slain was the brother of my paramour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stings itself to everlasting death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hang whatever knight of thine I fought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tumbled. Art thou King?⁠—Look to thy life!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard in dead night along that table-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drops flat, and after the great waters break</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From less and less to nothing; thus he fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There trampled out his face from being known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through open doors, and swording right and left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The tables over and the wines, and slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the pavement streamed with massacre:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which half that autumn night, like the live North,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red-pulsing up through Alioth and Alcor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made all above it, and a hundred meres</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About it, as the water Moab saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came round by the East, and out beyond them flushed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fled with a shout, and that low lodge returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He whistled his good warhorse left to graze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stayed him. “Why weep ye?” “Lord,” she said, “my man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath left me or is dead;” whereon he thought⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What, if she hate me now? I would not this.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What, if she love me still? I would not that.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not what I would”⁠—but said to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He find thy favour changed and love thee not”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then pressing day by day through Lyonnesse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A crown of towers.</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Down in a casement sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flushed, started, met him at the doors, and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Belted his body with her white embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying aloud, “Not Mark⁠—not Mark, my soul!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The footstep fluttered me at first: not he:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Catlike through his own castle steals my Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who hates thee, as I him⁠—even to the death.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom Sir Tristram smiling, “I am here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And drawing somewhat backward she replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Can he be wronged who is not even his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But save for dread of thee had beaten me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scratched, bitten, blinded, marred me somehow⁠—Mark?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What rights are his that dare not strike for them?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not lift a hand⁠—not, though he found me thus!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But harken! have ye met him? hence he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Today for three days’ hunting⁠—as he said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so returns belike within an hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark’s way, my soul!⁠—but eat not thou with Mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because he hates thee even more than fears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My God, the measure of my hate for Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is as the measure of my love for thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, plucked one way by hate and one by love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drained of her force, again she sat, and spake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O hunter, and O blower of the horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, ere I mated with my shambling king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye twain had fallen out about the bride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of one⁠—his name is out of me⁠—the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If prize she were⁠—(what marvel⁠—she could see)⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wreck thee villainously: but, O Sir Knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, “Last to my Queen Paramount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here now to my Queen Paramount of love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loveliness⁠—ay, lovelier than when first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing from Ireland.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>Softly laughed Isolt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My dole of beauty trebled?” and he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thine is more to me⁠—soft, gracious, kind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most gracious; but she, haughty, even to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make one doubt if ever the great Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have yielded him her love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>To whom Isolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who brakest through the scruple of my bond,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I⁠—misyoked with such a want of man⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I could hardly sin against the lowest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He answered, “O my soul, be comforted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made us happy: but how ye greet me⁠—fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fault and doubt⁠—no word of that fond tale⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Tristram in that year he was away.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I had forgotten all in my strong joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see thee⁠—yearnings?⁠—ay! for, hour by hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here in the never-ended afternoon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O sweeter than all memories of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deeper than any yearnings after thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seemed those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watched from this tower. Isolt of Britain dashed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would that have chilled her bride-kiss? Wedded her?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fought in her father’s battles? wounded there?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King was all fulfilled with gratefulness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And she, my namesake of the hands, that healed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well⁠—can I wish her any huger wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than having known thee? her too hast thou left</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pine and waste in those sweet memories.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O were I not my Mark’s, by whom all men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are noble, I should hate thee more than love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did I love her? the name at least I loved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Isolt?⁠—I fought his battles, for Isolt!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The name was ruler of the dark⁠—Isolt?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Isolt answered, “Yea, and why not I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then flashed a levin-brand; and near me stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mark’s way to steal behind one in the dark⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For there was Mark: ‘He has wedded her,’ he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not said, but hissed it: then this crown of towers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So shook to such a roar of all the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That here in utter dark I swooned away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And woke again in utter dark, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘I will flee hence and give myself to God’⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou wert lying in thy new leman’s arms.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And past desire!” a saying that angered her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“ ‘May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet no more to me!’ I need Him now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when had Lancelot uttered aught so gross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the swineherd’s malkin in the mast?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The greater man, the greater courtesy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far other was the Tristram, Arthur’s knight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, through ever harrying thy wild beasts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Becomes thee well⁠—art grown wild beast thyself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How darest thou, if lover, push me even</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In fancy from thy side, and set me far</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the gray distance, half a life away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And solemnly as when ye sware to him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The man of men, our King⁠—My God, the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was once in vows when men believed the King!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They lied not then, who sware, and through their vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King prevailing made his realm:⁠—I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swear to me thou wilt love me even when old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My knighthood taught me this⁠—ay, being snapt⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We run more counter to the soul thereof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than had we never sworn. I swear no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For once⁠—even to the height⁠—I honoured him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>‘Man, is he man at all?’ methought, when first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That victor of the Pagan throned in hall⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His hair, a sun that rayed from off a brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The golden beard that clothed his lips with light⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Merlin’s mystic babble about his end</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shaped as a dragon; he seemed to me no man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Being amazed: but this went by⁠—The vows!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O ay⁠—the wholesome madness of an hour⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They served their use, their time; for every knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Believed himself a greater than himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every follower eyed him as a God;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so the realm was made; but then their vows⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First mainly through that sullying of our Queen⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dropt down from heaven? washed up from out the deep?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They failed to trace him through the flesh and blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of our old kings: whence then? a doubtful lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To bind them by inviolable vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For feel this arm of mine⁠—the tide within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Red with free chase and heather-scented air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As any maiden child? lock up my tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From uttering freely what I freely hear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bind me to one? The wide world laughs at it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And worldling of the world am I, and know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woos his own end; we are not angels here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shall be: vows⁠—I am woodman of the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore is my love so large for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing it is not bounded save by love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Good: an I turned away my love for thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To someone thrice as courteous as thyself⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For courtesy wins woman all as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As valour may, but he that closes both</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is perfect, he is Lancelot⁠—taller indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rosier and comelier, thou⁠—but say I loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine own small saw, ‘We love but while we may,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Well then, what answer?”</span>
			</p>
			<p class="right">
				<span>He that while she spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The warm white apple of her throat, replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Press this a little closer, sweet, until⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come, I am hungered and half-angered⁠—meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wine, wine⁠—and I will love thee to the death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out beyond into the dream to come.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So then, when both were brought to full accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She rose, and set before him all he willed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after these had comforted the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now talking of their woodland paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now mocking at the much ungainliness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ay, ay, O ay⁠—the winds that bend the brier!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A star in heaven, a star within the mere!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, O ay⁠—a star was my desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was far apart, and one was near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, O ay⁠—the winds that bow the grass!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was water and one star was fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one will ever shine and one will pass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ay, ay, O ay⁠—the winds that move the mere.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then in the light’s last glimmer Tristram showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The collar of some Order, which our King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not so, my Queen,” he said, “but the red fruit</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hither brought by Tristram for his last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke, he turned, then, flinging round her neck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claspt it, and cried, “Thine Order, O my Queen!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mark’s way,” said Mark, and clove him through the brain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That night came Arthur home, and while he climbed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stairway to the hall, and looked and saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The great Queen’s bower was dark⁠—about his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What art thou?” and the voice about his feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent up an answer, sobbing, “I am thy fool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I shall never make thee smile again.”</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Marriage of Geraint</h2>
			<p>
				<span>The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A tributary prince of Devon, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that great Order of the Table Round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had married Enid, Yniol’s only child,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And as the light of Heaven varies, now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make her beauty vary day by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In crimsons and in purples and in gems.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid, but to please her husband’s eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who first had found and loved her in a state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Loved her, and often with her own white hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Next after her own self, in all the court.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Adored her, as the stateliest and the best</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loveliest of all women upon earth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing them so tender and so close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when a rumour rose about the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world’s loud whisper breaking into storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had suffered, or should suffer any taint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In nature: wherefore going to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He made this pretext, that his princedom lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Close on the borders of a territory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Assassins, and all flyers from the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore, till the King himself should please</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He craved a fair permission to depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there defend his marches; and the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Severn, and they past to their own land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He compassed her with sweet observances</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And worship, never leaving her, and grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of his promise to the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of his glory and his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And by and by the people, when they met</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In twos and threes, or fuller companies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And molten down in mere uxoriousness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this she gathered from the people’s eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This too the women who attired her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But could not out of bashful delicacy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While he that watched her sadden, was the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suspicious that her nature had a taint.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last, it chanced that on a summer morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(They sleeping each by either) the new sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beat through the blindless casement of the room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bared the knotted column of his throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The massive square of his heroic breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As slopes a wild brook o’er a little stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Running too vehemently to break upon it.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Admiring him, and thought within herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was ever man so grandly made as he?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, like a shadow, past the people’s talk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And accusation of uxoriousness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across her mind, and bowing over him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low to her own heart piteously she said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O noble breast and all-puissant arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am the cause, because I dare not speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tell him what I think and what they say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet I hate that he should linger here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot love my lord and not his name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride with him to battle and stand by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And watch his mightful hand striking great blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far better were I laid in the dark earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not hearing any more his noble voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not to be folded more in these dear arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And darkened from the high light in his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yet not dare to tell him what I think,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how men slur him, saying all his force</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is melted into mere effeminacy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O me, I fear that I am no true wife.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the strong passion in her made her weep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>True tears upon his broad and naked breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And these awoke him, and by great mischance</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He heard but fragments of her later words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that she feared she was not a true wife.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then he thought, “In spite of all my care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is not faithful to me, and I see her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur’s hall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then though he loved and reverenced her too much</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dream she could be guilty of foul act,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right through his manful breast darted the pang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That makes a man, in the sweet face of her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My charger and her palfrey;” then to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I will ride forth into the wilderness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have not fallen so low as some would wish.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ride with me.” And Enid asked, amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, “I charge thee, ask not, but obey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then she bethought her of a faded silk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A faded mantle and a faded veil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein she kept them folded reverently</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She took them, and arrayed herself therein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering when first he came on her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her foolish fears about the dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his journey to her, as himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had told her, and their coming to the court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There on a day, he sitting high in hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before him came a forester of Dean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First seen that day: these things he told the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then the good King gave order to let blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the King petitioned for his leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see the hunt, allowed it easily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So with the morning all the court were gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Guinevere lay late into the morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rose at last, a single maiden with her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A purple scarf, at either end whereof</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There swung an apple of the purest gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swayed round about him, as he galloped up</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In summer suit and silks of holiday.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet and statelily, and with all grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Late, late, Sir Prince,” she said, “later than we!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Yea, noble Queen,” he answered, “and so late</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I but come like you to see the hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not join it.” “Therefore wait with me,” she said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“For on this little knoll, if anywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here often they break covert at our feet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And while they listened for the distant hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Arthur’s hound of deepest mouth, there rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Guinevere, not mindful of his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the King’s hall, desired his name, and sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who being vicious, old and irritable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And doubling all his master’s vice of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer sharply that she should not know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then will I ask it of himself,” she said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,” cried the dwarf;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when she put her horse toward the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck at her with his whip, and she returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exclaiming, “Surely I will learn the name,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who answered as before; and when the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Prince’s blood spirted upon the scarf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But he, from his exceeding manfulness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pure nobility of temperament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From even a word, and so returning said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Done in your maiden’s person to yourself:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I will track this vermin to their earths:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find, at some place I shall come at, arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the third day will again be here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So that I be not fallen in fight. Farewell.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Farewell, fair Prince,” answered the stately Queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And may you light on all things that you love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And live to wed with her whom first you love:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, were she the daughter of a king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little vext at losing of the hunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little at the vile occasion, rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And valley, with fixt eye following the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At last they issued from the world of wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thither there came Geraint, and underneath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld the long street of a little town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a long valley, on one side whereof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White from the mason’s hand, a fortress rose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on one side a castle in decay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And out of town and valley came a noise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of a broad brook o’er a shingly bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At distance, ere they settle for the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And onward to the fortress rode the three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And entered, and were lost behind the walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So,” thought Geraint, “I have tracked him to his earth.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And down the long street riding wearily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Found every hostel full, and everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His master’s armour; and of such a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He asked, “What means the tumult in the town?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who told him, scouring still, “The sparrow-hawk!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then riding close behind an ancient churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who answered gruffly, “Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then riding further past an armourer’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He put the selfsame query, but the man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has little time for idle questioners.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The murmur of the world! What is it to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where can I get me harbourage for the night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy? Speak!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat the armourer turning all amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing one so gay in purple silks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came forward with the helmet yet in hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered, “Pardon me, O stranger knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there is scantly time for half the work.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms? truth! I know not: all are wanted here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It may be, at Earl Yniol’s, o’er the bridge</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yonder.” He spoke and fell to work again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Whither, fair son?” to whom Geraint replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Yniol, “Enter therefore and partake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The slender entertainment of a house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thanks, venerable friend,” replied Geraint;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For supper, I will enter, I will eat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the passion of a twelve hours’ fast.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered, “Graver cause than yours is mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We will not touch upon him even in jest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rode Geraint into the castle court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His charger trampling many a prickly star</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He looked and saw that all was ruinous.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here had fallen a great part of a tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And high above a piece of turret stair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And while he waited in the castle court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice of Enid, Yniol’s daughter, rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clear through the open casement of the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moves him to think what kind of bird it is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That sings so delicately clear, and make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Conjecture of the plumage and the form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And made him like a man abroad at morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When first the liquid note beloved of men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comes flying over many a windy wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To Britain, and in April suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he suspends his converse with a friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or it may be the labour of his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think or say, “There is the nightingale;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Here, by God’s grace, is the one voice for me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It chanced the song that Enid sang was one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With that wild wheel we go not up or down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For man is man and master of his fate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hark, by the bird’s song ye may learn the nest,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said Yniol; “enter quickly.” Entering then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right o’er a mount of newly-fallen stones,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her daughter. In a moment thought Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Here by God’s rood is the one maid for me.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But none spake word except the hoary Earl:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Enid, the good knight’s horse stands in the court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we will make us merry as we may.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spake: the Prince, as Enid past him, fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His purple scarf, and held, and said, “Forbear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Endures not that her guest should serve himself.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reverencing the custom of the house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Enid took his charger to the stall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after went her way across the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet spoke together, came again with one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A youth, that following with a costrel bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then, because their hall must also serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood behind, and waited on the three.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Geraint had longing in him evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That crost the trencher as she laid it down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But after all had eaten, then Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now the wine made summer in his veins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let his eye rove in following, or rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For if he be the knight whom late I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ride into that new fortress by your town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White from the mason’s hand, then have I sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From his own lips to have it⁠—I am Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Devon⁠—for this morning when the Queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sent her own maiden to demand the name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Struck at her with his whip, and she returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I would track this caitiff to his hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They take the rustic murmur of their bourg</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For the great wave that echoes round the world;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They would not hear me speak: but if ye know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I can light on arms, or if yourself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I will break his pride and learn his name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Avenging this great insult done the Queen.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then cried Earl Yniol, “Art thou he indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Geraint, a name far-sounded among men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For noble deeds? and truly I, when first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I saw you moving by me on the bridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And presence might have guessed you one of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That eat in Arthur’s hall in Camelot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this dear child hath often heard me praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your feats of arms, and often when I paused</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So grateful is the noise of noble deeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O never yet had woman such a pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suitors as this maiden: first Limours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not, but he past to the wild land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My curse, my nephew⁠—I will not let his name</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slip from my lips if I can help it⁠—he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When that I knew him fierce and turbulent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since the proud man often is the mean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He sowed a slander in the common ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Affirming that his father left him gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bribed with large promises the men who served</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About my person, the more easily</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because my means were somewhat broken into</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through open doors and hospitality;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raised my own town against me in the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before my Enid’s birthday, sacked my house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From mine own earldom foully ousted me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Built that new fort to overawe my friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For truly there are those who love me yet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that his pride too much despises me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I myself sometimes despise myself;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have let men be, and have their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Am much too gentle, have not used my power:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor know I whether I be very base</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or very manful, whether very wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or very foolish; only this I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whatsoever evil happen to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But can endure it all most patiently.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well said, true heart,” replied Geraint, “but arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In next day’s tourney I may break his pride.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Yniol answered, “Arms, indeed, but old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in this tournament can no man tilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Except the lady he loves best be there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over these is placed a silver wand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prize of beauty for the fairest there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And this, what knight soever be in field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lays claim to for the lady at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who being apt at arms and big of bone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has ever won it for the lady with him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And toppling over all antagonism</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has earned himself the name of ‘sparrow-hawk.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Leaning a little toward him, “Thy leave!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let me lay lance in rest, O noble host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For this dear child, because I never saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though having seen all beauties of our time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And if I fall her name will yet remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Untarnished as before; but if I live,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As I will make her truly my true wife.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, howsoever patient, Yniol’s heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looking round he saw not Enid there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(Who hearing her own name had stolen away)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that old dame, to whom full tenderly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And folding all her hand in his he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And best by her that bore her understood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With frequent smile and nod departing found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On either shining shoulder laid a hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kept her off and gazed upon her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And told them all their converse in the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proving her heart: but never light and shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Coursed one another more on open ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the face of Enid hearing her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While slowly falling as a scale that falls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When weight is added only grain by grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So moving without answer to her rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She found no rest, and ever failed to draw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quiet night into her blood, but lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Contemplating her own unworthiness;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when the pale and bloodless east began</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thither came the twain, and when Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Himself beyond the rest pushing could move</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The chair of Idris. Yniol’s rusted arms</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were on his princely person, but through these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ladies came, and by and by the town</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there they fixt the forks into the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over these they placed the silver wand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then Yniol’s nephew, after trumpet blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What I these two years past have won for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prize of beauty.” Loudly spake the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Forbear: there is a worthier,” and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With some surprise and thrice as much disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So burnt he was with passion, crying out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Do battle for it then,” no more; and thrice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So often and with such blows, that all the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wondered, and now and then from distant walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a clapping as of phantom hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dew of their great labour, and the blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But either’s force was matched till Yniol’s cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Remember that great insult done the Queen,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Increased Geraint’s, who heaved his blade aloft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And said, “Thy name?” To whom the fallen man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made answer, groaning, “Edyrn, son of Nudd!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My pride is broken: men have seen my fall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,” replied Geraint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shalt ride to Arthur’s court, and coming there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Edyrn answered, “These things will I do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I have never yet been overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rising up, he rode to Arthur’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there the Queen forgave him easily.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And being young, he changed and came to loathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great battle fighting for the King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the third day from the hunting-morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made a low splendour in the world, and wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the dancing shadows of the birds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke and bethought her of her promise given</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No later than last eve to Prince Geraint⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So bent he seemed on going the third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He would not leave her, till her promise given⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ride with him this morning to the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there be made known to the stately Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there be wedded with all ceremony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And thought it never yet had looked so mean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For as a leaf in mid-November is</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To what it is in mid-October, seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dress that now she looked on to the dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still she looked, and still the terror grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All staring at her in her faded silk:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And softly to her own sweet heart she said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This noble prince who won our earldom back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So splendid in his acts and his attire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Would he could tarry with us here awhile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But being so beholden to the Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It were but little grace in any of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bent as he seemed on going this third day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To seek a second favour at his hands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far liefer than so much discredit him.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid fell in longing for a dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of her good mother, given her on the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before her birthday, three sad years ago,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scattered all they had to all the winds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For while the mother showed it, and the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were turning and admiring it, the work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To both appeared so costly, rose a cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Edyrn’s men were on them, and they fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With little save the jewels they had on,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Edyrn’s men had caught them in their flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And placed them in this ruin; and she wished</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Prince had found her in her ancient home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then let her fancy flit across the past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And roam the goodly places that she knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And last bethought her how she used to watch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one was patched and blurred and lustreless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among his burnished brethren of the pool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And half asleep she made comparison</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that and these to her own faded self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the gay court, and fell asleep again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dreamt herself was such a faded form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among her burnished sisters of the pool;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But this was in the garden of a king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all was bright; that all about were birds</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the turf was rich in plots that looked</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lords and ladies of the high court went</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In silver tissue talking things of state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And children of the King in cloth of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And while she thought “They will not see me,” came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the children in their cloth of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ran to her, crying, “If we have fish at all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To pick the faded creature from the pool,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cast it on the mixen that it die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal one came and seized on her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid started waking, with her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All overshadowed by the foolish dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lo! it was her mother grasping her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To get her well awake; and in her hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A suit of bright apparel, which she laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How fast they hold like colours of a shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why not? It never yet was worn, I trow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Enid looked, but all confused at first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And answered, “Yea, I know it; your good gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So sadly lost on that unhappy night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Your own good gift!” “Yea, surely,” said the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“And gladly given again this happy morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For when the jousts were ended yesterday,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He found the sack and plunder of our house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All scattered through the houses of the town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And gave command that all which once was ours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should now be ours again: and yester-eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came one with this and laid it in my hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because we have our earldom back again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I myself unwillingly have worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And howsoever patient, Yniol his.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That appertains to noble maintenance.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all through that young traitor, cruel need</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Constrained us, but a better time has come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So clothe yourself in this, that better fits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our mended fortunes and a Prince’s bride:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though I heard him call you fairest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let never maiden think, however fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She is not fairer in new clothes than old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And should some great court-lady say, the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like a madman brought her to the court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To whom we are beholden; but I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That when my dear child is set forth at her best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That neither court nor country, though they sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through all the provinces like those of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Enid listened brightening as she lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, as the white and glittering star of morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Helped by the mother’s careful hand and eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She never yet had seen her half so fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called her like that maiden in the tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flur, for whose love the Roman Caesar first</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Invaded Britain, “But we beat him back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As this great Prince invaded us, and we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I can scarcely ride with you to court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see my princess as I see her now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Enid, and when Yniol made report</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of that good mother making Enid gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In such apparel as might well beseem</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He answered: “Earl, entreat her by my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Albeit I give no reason but my wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That she ride with me in her faded silk.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yniol with that hard message went; it fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dared not to glance at her good mother’s face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But silently, in all obedience,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her mother silent too, nor helping her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And robed them in her ancient suit again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so descended. Never man rejoiced</span>
				<br/>
				<span>More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And glancing all at once as keenly at her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As careful robins eye the delver’s toil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But rested with her sweet face satisfied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then seeing cloud upon the mother’s brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At thy new son, for my petition to her.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beholding one so bright in dark estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sunlike from cloud⁠—and likewise thought perhaps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That service done so graciously would bind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The two together; fain I would the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should love each other: how can Enid find</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A nobler friend? Another thought was mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I came among you here so suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That though her gentle presence at the lists</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Might well have served for proof that I was loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I doubted whether daughter’s tenderness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or easy nature, might not let itself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or whether some false sense in her own self</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of my contrasting brightness, overbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And such a sense might make her long for court</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all its perilous glories: and I thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That could I someway prove such force in her</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Linked with such love for me, that at a word</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(No reason given her) she could cast aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A splendour dear to women, new to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therefore dearer; or if not so new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of intermitted usage; then I felt</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fixt on her faith. Now, therefore, I do rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A prophet certain of my prophecy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That never shadow of mistrust can cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between us. Grant me pardon for my thoughts:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for my strange petition I will make</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When your fair child shall wear your costly gift</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who knows? another gift of the high God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spoke: the mother smiled, but half in tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And white sails flying on the yellow sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But not to goodly hill or yellow sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then descending met them at the gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And did her honour as the Prince’s bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all that week was old Caerleon gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They twain were wedded with all ceremony.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this was on the last year’s Whitsuntide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Enid ever kept the faded silk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remembering how first he came on her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all her foolish fears about the dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his journey toward her, as himself</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had told her, and their coming to the court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now this morning when he said to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Put on your worst and meanest dress,” she found</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took it, and arrayed herself therein.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Passing of Arthur</h2>
			<p>
				<span>That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>First made and latest left of all the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Told, when the man was no more than a voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the white winter of his age, to those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For on their march to westward, Bedivere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who slowly paced among the slumbering host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I found Him in the shining of the stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I marked Him in the flowering of His fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in His ways with men I find Him not.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O me! for why is all around us here</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if some lesser god had made the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But had not force to shape it as he would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the High God behold it from beyond,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And enter it, and make it beautiful?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or else as if the world were wholly fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have not power to see it as it is:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Perchance, because we see not to the close;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I, being simple, thought to work His will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And have but stricken with the sword in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all whereon I leaned in wife and friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Reels back into the beast, and is no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay⁠—God my Christ⁠—I pass but shall not die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain killed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Lancelot’s war, the ghost of Gawain blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Along a wandering wind, and past his ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Went shrilling, “Hollow, hollow all delight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hail, King! tomorrow thou shalt pass away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I am blown along a wandering wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fainter onward, like wild birds that change</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Their season in the night and wail their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrilled; but in going mingled with dim cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As of some lonely city sacked by night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all is lost, and wife and child with wail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and called,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Who spake? A dream. O light upon the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine, Gawain, was the voice⁠—are these dim cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“O me, my King, let pass whatever will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in their stead thy name and glory cling</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all high places like a golden cloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Forever: but as yet thou shalt not pass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Light was Gawain in life, and light in death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the steps of Modred in the west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And with him many of thy people, and knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Right well in heart they know thee for the King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Arise, go forth and conquer as of old.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Far other is this battle in the west</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shook him through the north. Ill doom is mine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To war against my people and my knights.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The king who fights his people fights himself.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That strikes them dead is as my death to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through this blind haze, which ever since I saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One lying in the dust at Almesbury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hath folded in the passes of the world.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose the King and moved his host by night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever pushed Sir Modred, league by league,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A land of old upheaven from the abyss</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By fire, to sink into the abyss again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the long mountains ended in a coast</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of ever-shifting sand, and far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The phantom circle of a moaning sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There the pursuer could pursue no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he that fled no further fly the King;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And there, that day when the great light of heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Burned at his lowest in the rolling year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A death-white mist slept over sand and sea:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With formless fear; and even on Arthur fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some had visions out of golden youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And some beheld the faces of old ghosts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Look in upon the battle; and in the mist</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Was many a noble deed, many a base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And chance and craft and strength in single fights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ever and anon with host to host</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battleaxes on shattered helms, and shrieks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After the Christ, of those who falling down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked up for heaven, and only saw the mist;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oaths, insults, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In that close mist, and cryings for the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Last, as by some one deathbed after wail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of suffering, silence follows, or through death</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Save for some whisper of the seething seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mist aside, and with that wind the tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of battle: but no man was moving there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brake in among dead faces, to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shivered brands that once had fought with Rome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rolling far along the gloomy shores</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice of days of old and days to be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And whiter than the mist that all day long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had held the field of battle was the King:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beats upon the faces of the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My dead, as though they had not died for me?⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fallen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confusion, till I know not what I am,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold, I seem but King among the dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere: “My King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There also will I worship thee as King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The heathen back among us, yonder stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Modred, unharmed, the traitor of thine house.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake the King: “My house hath been my doom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But call not thou this traitor of my house</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My house are rather they who sware my vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yea, even while they brake them, owned me King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all the purport of my throne hath failed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That quick or dead thou holdest me for King.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King am I, whatsoever be their cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, ere I pass.” And uttering this the King</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made at the man: then Modred smote his liege</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So all day long the noise of battle rolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the mountains by the winter sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until King Arthur’s Table, man by man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>King Arthur. Then, because his wound was deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A broken chancel with a broken cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That stood on a dark strait of barren land:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On one side lay the Ocean, and on one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lay a great water, and the moon was full.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The sequel of today unsolders all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The goodliest fellowship of famous knights</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They sleep⁠—the men I loved. I think that we</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall never more, at any future time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Walking about the gardens and the halls</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Camelot, as in the days that were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I perish by this people which I made⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though Merlin sware that I should come again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am so deeply smitten through the helm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That without help I cannot last till morn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In those old days, one summer noon, an arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Holding the sword⁠—and how I rowed across</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And took it, and have worn it, like a king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, wheresoever I am sung or told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In aftertime, this also shall be known:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now delay not: take Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fling him far into the middle mere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A little thing may harm a wounded man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, from the ruined shrine he stept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Came on the shining levels of the lake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And o’er him, drawing it, the winter moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This way and that dividing the swift mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In act to throw: but at the last it seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Better to leave Excalibur concealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in the many-knotted waterflags,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strode he back slow to the wounded King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wild water lapping on the crag.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not rendering true answer, as beseemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For surer sign had followed, either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This is a shameful thing for men to lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then went Sir Bedivere the second time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How curiously and strangely chased, he smote</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His palms together, and he cried aloud:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if indeed I cast the brand away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should thus be lost forever from the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What good should follow this, if this were done?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What harm, undone? Deep harm to disobey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Were it well to obey then, if a king demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>An act unprofitable, against himself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The King is sick, and knows not what he does.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What record, or what relic of my lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should be to aftertime, but empty breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rumours of a doubt? But were this kept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Someone might show it at a joust of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Saying, ‘King Arthur’s sword, Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the hidden bases of the hills.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So might some old man speak in the aftertime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To all the people, winning reverence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now much honour and much fame were lost.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hid Excalibur the second time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And so strode back slow to the wounded King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“I heard the water lapping on the crag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the long ripple washing in the reeds.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Authority forgets a dying king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Laid widowed of the power in his eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That bowed the will. I see thee what thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In whom should meet the offices of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Either from lust of gold, or like a girl</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will arise and slay thee with my hands.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the bulrush beds, and clutched the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And strongly wheeled and threw it. The great brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seen where the moving isles of winter shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times, and drew him under in the mere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lightly went the other to the King.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not though I live three lives of mortal men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So great a miracle as yonder hilt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But when I looked again, behold an arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That caught him by the hilt, and brandished him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three times, and drew him under in the mere.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“My end draws nigh; ’tis time that I were gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bear me to the margin; yet I fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, from the pavement he half rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Remorsefully regarded through his tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And would have spoken, but he found not words;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And rising bore him through the place of tombs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, as he walked, King Arthur panted hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When all the house is mute. So sighed the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Muttering and murmuring at his ear, “Quick, quick!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I fear it is too late, and I shall die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Larger than human on the frozen hills.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He heard the deep behind him, and a cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And barren chasms, and all to left and right</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based</span>
				<br/>
				<span>His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the long glories of the winter moon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath them; and descending they were ware</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That all the decks were dense with stately forms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream⁠—by these</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Three Queens with crowns of gold: and from them rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, as it were one voice, an agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All night in a waste land, where no one comes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or hath come, since the making of the world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then murmured Arthur, “Place me in the barge.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So to the barge they came. There those three Queens</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But she, that rose the tallest of them all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loosed the shattered casque, and chafed his hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And called him by his name, complaining loud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dropping bitter tears against a brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And colourless, and like the withered moon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made his forehead like a rising sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>High from the dais-throne⁠—were parched with dust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So like a shattered column lay the King;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From spur to plume a star of tournament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For now I see the true old times are dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When every morning brought a noble chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And every chance brought out a noble knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such times have been not since the light that led</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now the whole Round Table is dissolved</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Which was an image of the mighty world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I, the last, go forth companionless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the days darken round me, and the years,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among new men, strange faces, other minds.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“The old order changeth, yielding place to new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And God fulfils himself in many ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have lived my life, and that which I have done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May He within himself make pure! but thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If thou shouldst never see my face again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rise like a fountain for me night and day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For what are men better than sheep or goats</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That nourish a blind life within the brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Both for themselves and those who call them friend?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so the whole round earth is every way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now farewell. I am going a long way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With these thou seest⁠—if indeed I go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the island-valley of Avilion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said he, and the barge with oar and sail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Revolving many memories, till the hull</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the mere the wailing died away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when that moan had past for evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The stillness of the dead world’s winter dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amazed him, and he groaned, “The King is gone.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“From the great deep to the great deep he goes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The last hard footstep of that iron crag;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thence marked the black hull moving yet, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“He passes to be King among the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And after healing of his grievous wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He comes again; but⁠—if he come no more⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who shrieked and wailed, the three whereat we gazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On that high day, when, clothed with living light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They stood before his throne in silence, friends</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then from the dawn it seemed there came, but faint</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As from beyond the limit of the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like the last echo born of a great cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Around a king returning from his wars.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even to the highest he could climb, and saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down that long water opening on the deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From less to less and vanish into light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the new sun rose bringing the new year.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">To the Queen</h2>
			<p>
				<span>O loyal to the royal in thyself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And loyal to thy land, as this to thee⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bear witness, that rememberable day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From halfway down the shadow of the grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Past with thee through thy people and their love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And London rolled one tide of joy through all</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thunderless lightnings striking under sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that true North, whereof we lately heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A strain to shame us “keep you to yourselves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So loyal is too costly! friends⁠—your love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is but a burthen: loose the bond, and go.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is this the tone of empire? here the faith</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So feebly? wealthier⁠—wealthier⁠—hour by hour!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voice of Britain, or a sinking land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There rang her voice, when the full city pealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee and thy Prince! The loyal to their crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are loyal to their own far sons, who love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ever-broadening England, and her throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That knows not her own greatness: if she knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dreads it we are fallen.⁠—But thou, my Queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Not for itself, but through thy living love</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For one to whom I made it o’er his grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ideal manhood closed in real man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of Geoffrey’s book, or him of Malleor’s, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touched by the adulterous finger of a time</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hovered between war and wantonness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crownings and dethronements: take withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thy poet’s blessing, and his trust that Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Will blow the tempest in the distance back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From thine and ours: for some are scared, who mark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waverings of every vane with every wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wordy trucklings to the transient hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fierce or careless looseners of the faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Softness breeding scorn of simple life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that which knows, but careful for itself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And that which knows not, ruling that which knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To its own harm: the goal of this great world</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lies beyond sight: yet⁠—if our slowly-grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And crowned Republic’s crowning common-sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That saved her many times, not fail⁠—their fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Are morning shadows huger than the shapes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That cast them, not those gloomier which forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The darkness of that battle in the West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where all of high and holy dies away.</span>
