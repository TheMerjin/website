									<span>Make periods in the midst of sentences,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Throttle their practised accent in their fears</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Out of this silence yet I pick’d a welcome;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in the modesty of fearful duty</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I read as much as from the rattling tongue</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of saucy and audacious eloquence.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In least speak most, to my capacity.</span>
