									<br/>
									<span>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that “Caesar”?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with ’em,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But it was famed with more than with one man?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When could they say till now, that talk’d of Rome,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That her wide walls encompass’d but one man?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When there is in it but one only man.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There was a Brutus once that would have brook’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As easily as a king.</span>

									<span>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The evil that men do lives after them;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The good is oft interred with their bones;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And grievously hath Caesar answer’d it.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For Brutus is an honourable man;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So are they all, all honourable men⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Come I to speak in Caesar’s funeral.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Brutus is an honourable man.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He hath brought many captives home to Rome,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And Brutus is an honourable man.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You all did see that on the Lupercal</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But here I am to speak what I do know.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You all did love him once, not without cause:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors’ arms,</span>
