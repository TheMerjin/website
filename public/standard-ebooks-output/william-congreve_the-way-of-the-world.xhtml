I’ll tell thee, Fainall, she once used me with that insolence that in revenge I took her to pieces, sifted her, and separated her failings: I studied ’em and got ’em by rote. The catalogue was so large that I was not without hopes, one day or other, to hate her heartily. To which end I so used myself to think of ’em, that at length, contrary to my design and expectation, they gave me every hour less and less disturbance, till in a few days it became habitual to me to remember ’em without being displeased.

					<br/>
					<span>No sense of wit when rude spectators know,</span>

					<span>How could, great author, your aspiring mind</span>

					<span>Dare to write only to the few refined?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet though that nice ambition you pursue,</span>

					<span>’Tis not in Congreve’s power to please but few.</span>

					<span>Well-dressed barbarians know his awful name;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Pastora’s the complaint of every swain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pastora still the echo of the plain!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or if your muse describe, with warming force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wounded Frenchman falling from his horse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And her own William glorious in the strife,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>

					<span>You the great act as generously rehearse,</span>

					<span>And all the English fury’s in your verse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By your selected scenes and handsome choice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ennobled Comedy exalts her voice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You check unjust esteem and fond desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And teach to scorn what else we should admire:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The just impression taught by you we bear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The player acts the world, the world the player;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom still that world unjustly disesteems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though he alone professes what he seems.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when your muse assumes her tragic part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She conquers and she reigns in every heart:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To mourn with her men cheat their private woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And generous pity’s all the grief they know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The widow, who, impatient of delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the town joys must mask it to the play,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joins with your Mourning Bride’s resistless moan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And weeps a loss she slighted when her own:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You give us torment, and you give us ease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And vary our afflictions as you please.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is not a heart so kind as yours in pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To load your friends with cares you only feign;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your friends in grief, composed yourself, to leave?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ’tis the only way you’ll e’er deceive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then still, great sir, your moving power employ.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To lull our sorrow, and correct our joy.</span>

				<h2 epub:type="title">Dedication</h2>
				<p>To the Right Honourable<br/>
				<b>Ralph, Earl of Mountague, <abbr>etc.</abbr></b></p>
			</header>
			<p>My Lord,</p>
			<p>Whether the world will arraign me of vanity or not, that I have presumed to dedicate this comedy to your Lordship, I am yet in doubt; though, it may be, it is some degree of vanity even to doubt of it. One who has at any time had the honour of your Lordship’s conversation, cannot be supposed to think very meanly of that which he would prefer to your perusal. Yet it were to incur the imputation of too much sufficiency to pretend to such a merit as might abide the test of your Lordship’s censure.</p>
			<p>Whatever value may be wanting to this play while yet it is mine, will be sufficiently made up to it when it is once become your Lordship’s; and it is my security, that I cannot have overrated it more by my dedication than your Lordship will dignify it by your patronage.</p>
			<p>That it succeeded on the stage was almost beyond my expectation; for but little of it was prepared for that general taste which seems now to be predominant in the palates of our audience.</p>
			<p>Those characters which are meant to be ridiculed in most of our comedies are of fools so gross, that in my humble opinion they should rather disturb than divert the well-natured and reflecting part of an audience; they are rather objects of charity than contempt, and instead of moving our mirth, they ought very often to excite our compassion.</p>
			<p>This reflection moved me to design some characters which should appear ridiculous not so much through a natural folly (which is incorrigible, and therefore not proper for the stage) as through an affected wit: a wit which, at the same time that it is affected, is also false. As there is some difficulty in the formation of a character of this nature, so there is some hazard which attends the progress of its success upon the stage: for many come to a play so overcharged with criticism, that they very often let fly their censure, when through their rashness they have mistaken their aim. This I had occasion lately to observe: for this play had been acted two or three days before some of these hasty judges could find the leisure to distinguish betwixt the character of a Witwoud and a Truewit.</p>
			<p>I must beg your Lordship’s pardon for this digression from the true course of this epistle; but that it may not seem altogether impertinent, I beg that I may plead the occasion of it, in part of that excuse of which I stand in need, for recommending this comedy to your protection. It is only by the countenance of your Lordship, and the <em>few</em> so qualified, that such who write with care and pains can hope to be distinguished: for the prostituted name of <em>poet</em> promiscuously levels all that bear it.</p>
			<p>Terence, the most correct writer in the world, had a Scipio and a Lelius, if not to assist him, at least to support him in his reputation. And notwithstanding his extraordinary merit, it may be their countenance was not more than necessary.</p>
			<p>The purity of his style, the delicacy of his turns, and the justness of his characters, were all of them beauties which the greater part of his audience were incapable of tasting. Some of the coarsest strokes of Plautus, so severely censured by Horace, were more likely to affect the multitude; such, who come with expectation to laugh at the last act of a play, and are better entertained with two or three unseasonable jests than with the artful solution of the fable.</p>
			<p>As Terence excelled in his performances, so had he great advantages to encourage his undertakings, for he built most on the foundations of Menander: his plots were generally modelled, and his characters ready drawn to his hand. He copied Menander; and Menander had no less light in the formation of his characters from the observations of Theophrastus, of whom he was a disciple; and Theophrastus, it is known, was not only the disciple, but the immediate successor of Aristotle, the first and greatest judge of poetry. These were great models to design by; and the further advantage which Terence possessed towards giving his plays the due ornaments of purity of style, and justness of manners, was not less considerable from the freedom of conversation which was permitted him with Lelius and Scipio, two of the greatest and most polite men of his age. And, indeed, the privilege of such a conversation is the only certain means of attaining to the perfection of dialogue.</p>
			<p>If it has happened in any part of this comedy that I have gained a turn of style or expression more correct, or at least more corrigible, than in those which I have formerly written, I must, with equal pride and gratitude, ascribe it to the honour of your Lordship’s admitting me into your conversation, and that of a society where everybody else was so well worthy of you, in your retirement last summer from the town: for it was immediately after, that this comedy was written. If I have failed in my performance, it is only to be regretted, where there were so many not inferior either to a Scipio or a Lelius, that there should be one wanting equal in capacity to a Terence.</p>
			<p>If I am not mistaken, poetry is almost the only art which has not yet laid claim to your Lordship’s patronage. Architecture and painting, to the great honour of our country, have flourished under your influence and protection. In the meantime, poetry, the eldest sister of all arts, and parent of most, seems to have resigned her birthright, by having neglected to pay her duty to your Lordship, and by permitting others of a later extraction to prepossess that place in your esteem, to which none can pretend a better title. Poetry, in its nature, is sacred to the good and great: the relation between them is reciprocal, and they are ever propitious to it. It is the privilege of poetry to address them, and it is their prerogative alone to give it protection.</p>
			<p>This received maxim is a general apology for all writers who consecrate their labours to great men: but I could wish, at this time, that this address were exempted from the common pretence of all dedications; and that as I can distinguish your Lordship even among the most deserving, so this offering might become remarkable by some particular instance of respect, which should assure your Lordship that I am, with all due sense of your extreme worthiness and humanity, my Lord, your Lordship’s most obedient and most obliged humble servant,</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Epilogue</h2>
			<p>
				<span>After our Epilogue this crowd dismisses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I’m thinking how this play’ll be pulled to pieces.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But pray consider, e’er you doom its fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How hard a thing ’twould be to please you all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are some critics so with spleen diseased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They scarcely come inclining to be pleased:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sure he must have more than mortal skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who pleases anyone against his will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then, all bad poets we are sure are foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how their number’s swelled the town well knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In shoals, I’ve marked ’em judging in the pit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Though they’re on no pretence for judgment fit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But that they have been damned for want of wit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since when, they, by their own offences taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Set up for spies on plays, and finding fault.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Others there are whose malice we’d prevent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such, who watch plays, with scurrilous intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mark out who by characters are meant:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And though no perfect likeness they can trace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet each pretends to know the copied face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These, with false glosses, feed their own ill-nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn to libel what was meant a satire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>May such malicious fops this fortune find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think themselves alone the fools designed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If any are so arrogantly vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To think they singly can support a scene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And furnish fool enough to entertain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For well the learned and the judicious know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That satire scorns to stoop so meanly low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As any one abstracted fop to show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, as when painters form a matchless face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They from each fair one catch some different grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And shining features in one portrait blend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To which no single beauty must pretend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So poets oft do in one piece expose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whole <i xml:lang="fr">belles assemblées</i> of coquettes and beaux.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Prologue</h2>
			<p>
				<span>Of those few fools, who with ill stars are curst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure scribbling fools, called poets, fare the worst:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For they’re a sort of fools which Fortune makes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, after she has made ’em fools, forsakes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With Nature’s oafs ’tis quite a diff’rent case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Fortune favours all her idiot race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In her own nest the cuckoo eggs we find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O’er which she broods to hatch the changeling kind:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>No portion for her own she has to spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So much she dotes on her adopted care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poets are bubbles, by the town drawn in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Suffered at first some trifling stakes to win:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But what unequal hazards do they run!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Each time they write they venture all they’ve won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The squire that’s buttered still, is sure to be undone.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>This author, heretofore, has found your favour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But pleads no merit from his past behaviour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To build on that might prove a vain presumption,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should grants to poets made admit resumption,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in Parnassus he must lose his seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If that be found a forfeited estate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He owns, with toil he wrought the following scenes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But if they’re naught ne’er spare him for his pains:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Damn him the more; have no commiseration</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For dullness on mature deliberation.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He swears he’ll not resent one hissed-off scene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor, like those peevish wits, his play maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who, to assert their sense, your taste arraign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some plot we think he has, and some new thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some humour too, no farce⁠—but that’s a fault.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Satire, he thinks, you ought not to expect;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For so reformed a town who dares correct?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To please, this time, has been his sole pretence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He’ll not instruct, lest it should give offence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Should he by chance a knave or fool expose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That hurts none here, sure here are none of those.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In short, our play shall (with your leave to show it)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Give you one instance of a passive poet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who to your judgments yields all resignation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So save or damn, after your own discretion.</span>
