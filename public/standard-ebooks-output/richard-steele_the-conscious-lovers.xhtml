							<td>Honest Humphry, have patience; and I’ll tell thee all in order. I have, myself, in some part of my life, lived (indeed) with freedom, but, I hope, without reproach. Now, I thought liberty would be as little injurious to my son; therefore, as soon as he grew towards man, I indulged him in living after his own manner. I knew not how, otherwise, to judge of his inclination; for what can be concluded from a behaviour under restraint and fear?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a> But what charms me above all expression is, that my son has never, in the least action, the most distant hint or word, valued himself upon that great estate of his mother’s, which, according to our marriage settlement, he has had ever since he came to age.</td>

You have ever acted like a good and generous father, and he like an obedient and grateful son.</td>

							<td>Nay, his carriage is so easy to all with whom he converses, that he is never assuming, never prefers himself to others, nor ever is guilty of that rough sincerity which a man is not called to, and certainly disobliges most of his acquaintance; to be short, Humphry, his reputation was so fair in the world, that old Sealand, the great India merchant, has offered his only daughter, and sole heiress to that vast estate of his, as a wife for him. You may be sure I made no difficulties, the match was agreed on, and this very day named for the wedding.</td>

The clown was not reformed, but rudely persisted, and offered to force off my mask; with that, the gentleman, throwing off his own, appeared to be my son, and in his concern for me, tore off that of the nobleman; at this they seized each other; the company called the guards, and in the surprise the lady swooned away; upon which my son quitted his adversary, and had now no care but of the lady. When raising her in his arms, “Art thou gone,” cried he, “forever?⁠—forbid it, Heaven!” She revived at his known voice, and with the most familiar, though modest, gesture, hangs in safety over his shoulder weeping, but wept as in the arms of one before whom she could give herself a loose, were she not under observation; while she hides her face in his neck, he carefully conveys her from the company.</td>

I have said nothing to him yet⁠—but look you, Humphry, if there is so much in this amour of his, that he denies upon my summons to marry, I have cause enough to be offended; and then by my insisting upon his marrying today, I shall know how far he is engaged to this lady in masquerade, and from thence only shall be able to take my measures. In the meantime I would have you find out how far that rogue, his man, is let into his secret. He, I know, will play tricks as much to cross me, as to serve his master.</td>

We are false lovers; have a taste of music, poetry, billet-doux, dress, politics; ruin damsels; and when we are tired of this lewd town, and have a mind to take up, whip into our masters’ wigs and linen, and marry fortunes.</td>

Then, again, come down to the Court of Requests, and you see us all laying our broken heads together for the good of the nation; and though we never carry a question nemine contradicente, yet this I can say, with a safe conscience (and I wish every gentleman of our cloth could lay his hand upon his heart and say the same), that I never took so much as a single mug of beer for my vote in all my life.</td>

In this retreat, Providence again grew favourable to his industry, and, in six years’ time, restored him to his former fortunes. On this he sent directions over that his wife and little family should follow him to the Indies. His wife, impatient to obey such welcome orders, would not wait the leisure of a convoy, but took the first occasion of a single ship, and, with her husband’s sister only, and this daughter, then scarce seven years old, undertook the fatal voyage⁠—for here, poor creature, she lost her liberty and life. She and her family, with all they had, were, unfortunately, taken by a privateer from Toulon.

I’ll let her see at least my conduct to her is not changed. I’ll take this opportunity to visit her; for though the religious vow I have made to my father restrains me from ever marrying without his approbation, yet that confines me not from seeing a virtuous woman that is the pure delight of my eyes and the guiltless joy of my heart.

				<p>To<br/>
				the King.</p>
			</header>
			<p>May it please your Majesty,</p>
			<p>After having aspired to the highest and most laudable ambition, that of following the cause of liberty, I should not have humbly petitioned your Majesty for a direction of the theatre, had I not believed success in that province an happiness much to be wished by an honest man, and highly conducing to the prosperity of the commonwealth. It is in this view I lay before your Majesty a Comedy which the audience, in justice to themselves, has supported and encouraged, and is the prelude of what, by your Majesty’s influence and favour, may be attempted in future representations.</p>
			<p>The imperial mantle, the royal vestment, and the shining diadem are what strike ordinary minds; but your Majesty’s native goodness, your passion for justice, and her constant assessor mercy, is what continually surrounds you in the view of intelligent spirits, and gives hope to the suppliant, who sees he has more than succeeded in giving your Majesty an opportunity of doing good. Our King is above the greatness of royalty, and every act of his will which makes another man happy has ten times more charms in it than one that makes himself appear raised above the condition of others. But even this carries unhappiness with it; for calm dominion, equal grandeur, and familiar greatness do not easily affect the imagination of the vulgar, who cannot see power but in terror; and as fear moves mean spirits, and love prompts great ones to obey, the insinuations of malcontents are directed accordingly; and the unhappy people are ensnared, from want of reflection, into disrespectful ideas of their gracious and amiable sovereign, and then only begin to apprehend the greatness of their master when they have incurred his displeasure.</p>
			<p>As your Majesty was invited to the throne of a willing people, for their own sakes, and has ever enjoyed it with contempt of the ostentation of it, we beseech you to protect us who revere your title as we love your person. ’Tis to be a savage to be a rebel, and they who have fallen from you have not so much forfeited their allegiance as lost their humanity. And, therefore, if it were only to preserve myself from the imputation of being amongst the insensible and abandoned, I would beg permission in the most public manner possible to profess myself, with the utmost sincerity and zeal,</p>

					<p>Leonard Welsted, a protégé of Steele’s, wrote also the Epilogue.

					<p>In the old Royal Palace at Westminster, the House of Lords was formed out of the ancient Court of Requests, and the old Painted Chamber separated the Lords from the Commons. Steele has described (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Spectator</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 88) how servants, waiting for their masters at an alehouse at Westminster, debated upon public affairs, addressing each other by their employers’ names. <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-18" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>At the ridotto there was music, followed by dancing, the company passing, when the music was over, from the pit to the stage. Burney says that this Italian entertainment was first introduced into England in 1722, the year in which Steele produced <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Conscious Lovers</i>. <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-19" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Belsize House was the forerunner of Ranelagh and Vauxhall. There were gardens, in which refreshments could be obtained, and hunting, races, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, were provided to amuse the visitors, for whose protection twelve stout men, well armed, patrolled the road to London. A poetical satire, Belsize House, appeared in 1722, the year of this play. In the same year unlawful gaming at Belsize was forbidden (Park’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Hampstead</i>, 246⁠–⁠9). <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-19" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-20" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Among the Blenheim papers is a fragment, in Steele’s writing, of a dialogue between two servants, Parmeno and Pythias⁠—names taken, no doubt, from Terence’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Eunuchus</i>. The pair discuss the charm of the soft moments of servants in love, free from their usual restraints. Why should any man usurp more than his share of the atmosphere? The whole art of a serving-man is “to be here and there, and everywhere, unheard and unseen till you are wanted, and never absent when you are. This gives our masters and mistresses the free room and scope to do and act as they please⁠—they are to make all the bustle, all the show⁠—we are like convenient demons or apparitions about ’em, never to take up space or fill the air nor be heard of or seen but when commanded.” Pythias remarks how much she learns from Parmeno’s conversation, and produces a little collation from the last night’s supper which she has prepared for him. Parmeno eats the eggs, gorges, sings a song, and says kind things between whiles to Pythias. <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In the “Vision of Mirza” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Spectator</i>, <abbr>No.</abbr> 159), Addison pictured the Happy Islands which were the abode of good men after death. “Does life appear miserable, that gives thee opportunities of earning such a reward?” <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-23" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>In Terence, Glycerium comes to Athens with Chrysis, a courtesan, her supposed sister, and Pamphilus makes her acquaintance at Chrysis’s house. <a href="act-1.xhtml#noteref-24" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-29" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Steele had already described this scene in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Guardian</i> for June 20, 1713:⁠—“I happened the other day to pass by a gentleman’s house, and saw the most flippant scene of low love that I have ever observed. The maid was rubbing the windows within side of the house, and her humble servant the footman, was so happy a man as to be employed in cleaning the same glass on the side towards the street. The wench began with the greatest severity of aspect imaginable, and breathing on the glass, followed it with a dry cloth; her opposite observed her, and fetching a deep sigh, as if it were his last, with a very disconsolate air did the same on his side of the window. He still worked on and languished, until at last his fair one smiled, but covered herself, and spreading the napkin in her hand, concealed herself from her admirer, while he took pains, as it were, to work through all that intercepted their meeting. This pretty contest held for four or five large panes of glass, until at last the waggery was turned into an humorous way of breathing in each other’s faces, and catching the impression. The gay creatures were thus loving and pleasing their imaginations with their nearness and distance, until the windows were so transparent that the beauty of the female made the manservant impatient of beholding it, and the whole house besides being abroad, he ran in, and they romped out of my sight.” <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-29" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-30" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Steele’s monetary troubles made him personally familiar about the time he wrote this play with indentures tripartite, quadrupartite, and otherwise (See <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life of Steele</i>, 1889, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>., 291, 299, <abbr>etc.</abbr>). <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-30" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

			<p>This Comedy has been received with universal acceptance, for it was in every part excellently performed; and there needs no other applause of the actors but that they excelled according to the dignity and difficulty of the character they represented. But this great favour done to the work in acting renders the expectation still the greater from the author, to keep up the spirit in the representation of the closet, or any other circumstance of the reader, whether alone or in company; to which I can only say that it must be remembered, a play is to be seen, and is made to be represented with the advantage of action, nor can appear but with half the spirit without it. For the greatest effect of a play in reading is to excite the reader to go to see it; and when he does so, it is then a play has the effect of example and precept.</p>
			<p>The chief design of this was to be an innocent performance, and the audience have abundantly shown how ready they are to support what is visibly intended that way. Nor do I make any difficulty to acknowledge that the whole was writ for the sake of the scene of the Fourth Act, wherein <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bevil evades the quarrel with his friend, and<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a> hope it may have some effect upon the Goths and Vandals that frequent the theatres, or a more polite audience may supply their absence.</p>
			<p>But this incident, and the case of the father and daughter, are esteemed by some people no subjects of comedy; but I cannot be of their mind, for anything that has its foundation in happiness and success must be allowed to be the object of comedy; and sure it must be an improvement of it to introduce a joy too exquisite for laughter, that can have no spring but in delight, which is the case of this young lady. I must, therefore, contend that the tears which were shed on that occasion flowed from reason and good sense, and that men ought not to be laughed at for weeping till we are come to a more clear notion of what is to be imputed to the hardness of the head and the softness of the heart; and I think it was very politely said of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wilks, to one who told him there was a General<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> weeping for Indiana, “I’ll warrant he’ll fight ne’er the worse for that.” To be apt to give way to the impressions of humanity, is the excellence of a right disposition and the natural working of a well-turned spirit. But as I have suffered by critics who have got no farther than to inquire whether they ought to be pleased or not,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> I would willingly find them properer matter for their employment, and revive here a song which was omitted for want of a performer, and designed for the entertainment of Indiana. Signor Carbonelli,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> instead of it, played<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> on the fiddle, and it is for want of a singer that such advantageous things are said of an instrument which were designed for a voice. The song is the distress of a lovesick maid, and may be a fit entertainment for some small critics<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> to examine whether the passion is just or the distress male or female.</p>

			<p>It remains to say a word concerning Terence, and I am extremely surprised to find what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cibber told me prove a truth:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> that what I valued myself so much upon⁠—the translation of him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a>⁠—should be imputed to me as a reproach. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cibber’s zeal for the work, his care and application in instructing the actors and altering the disposition of the scenes, when I was, through sickness, unable to cultivate such things myself, has been a very obliging favour and friendship to me. For this reason I was very hardly persuaded<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> to throw away Terence’s celebrated funeral, and take only the bare authority of the young man’s character; and how I have worked it into an Englishman, and made use of the same circumstances of discovering a daughter when we least hoped for one, is humbly submitted to the learned reader.</p>

				<h2 epub:type="title">Prologue</h2>
				<p>By <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Welsted.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></p>

			<p>
				<span>To win your hearts and to secure your praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The comic writers strive by various ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By subtle stratagems they act their game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And leave untried no avenue to fame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>One writes the spouse a beating from his wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And says each stroke was copied from the life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some fix all wit and humour in grimace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And make a livelihood of Pinkey’s<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Here, one gay show and costly habits tries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Confiding to the judgment of your eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another smuts his scene (a cunning shaver),</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sure of the rakes’ and of the wenches’ favour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Oft have these arts prevailed, and one may guess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If practised o’er again, would find success.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the bold sage⁠—the poet of tonight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By new and desperate rules resolved to write;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fain would he give more just applauses rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And please by wit that scorns the aids of vice;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The praise he seeks from worthier motives springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such praise as praise to those that give it brings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Your aid most humbly sought, then, Britons lend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And liberal mirth like liberal men defend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more let ribaldry, with licence writ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Usurp the name of eloquence or wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No more let lawless farce uncensured go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lewd dull gleanings of a Smithfield show.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span>’Tis yours with breeding to refine the age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To chasten wit, and moralise the stage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ye modest, wise and good, ye fair, ye brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tonight the champion of your virtues save;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Redeem from long contempt the comic name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And judge politely for your country’s fame.</span>
