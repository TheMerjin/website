									<span>The king, your father, was reputed for</span>

									<span>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And unmatch’d wit and judgment: Ferdinand,</span>

									<span>My father, king of Spain, was reckon’d one</span>

									<span>A year before: it is not to be question’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That they had gather’d a wise council to them</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of every realm, that did debate this business,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who deem’d our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly</span>

									<br/>
									<span>I will be bold with time and your attention:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to’t:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My conscience first received a tenderness,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Who had been hither sent on the debating</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A marriage ’twixt the Duke of Orleans and</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Our daughter Mary: i’ the progress of this business,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sometimes our brother’s wife. This respite shook</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The bosom of my conscience, enter’d me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That many mazed considerings did throng</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And press’d in with this caution. First, methought</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Commanded nature, that my lady’s womb,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If it conceived a male child by me, should</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Do no more offices of life to’t than</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This world had air’d them: hence I took a thought,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Well worthy the best heir o’ the world, should not</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Be gladded in’t by me: then follows, that</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I weigh’d the danger which my realms stood in</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By this my issue’s fail; and that gave to me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now present here together; that’s to say,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I meant to rectify my conscience⁠—which</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well⁠—</span>

									<span>By all the reverend fathers of the land</span>

There was a haberdasher’s wife of small wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once, and hit that woman; who cried out “Clubs!” when I might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to her succour, which were the hope o’ the Strand, where she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my place: at length they came to the broom-staff to me; I defied ’em still: when suddenly a file of boys behind ’em, loose shot, delivered such a shower of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in, and let ’em win the work: the devil was amongst ’em, I think, surely.</td>

								<span>I come no more to make you laugh: things now,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That bear a weighty and a serious brow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>We now present. Those that can pity, here</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The subject will deserve it. Such as give</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their money out of hope they may believe,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>May here find truth too. Those that come to see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Only a show or two, and so agree</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The play may pass, if they be still and willing,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>I’ll undertake may see away their shilling</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Richly in two short hours. Only they</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That come to hear a merry bawdy play,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A noise of targets, or to see a fellow</span>
								<br/>
								<span>In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To rank our chosen truth with such a show</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To make that only true we now intend,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Will leave us never an understanding friend.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Therefore, for goodness’ sake, and as you are known</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The first and happiest hearers of the town,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The very persons of our noble story</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As they were living; think you see them great,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And follow’d with the general throng and sweat</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see</span>
								<br/>
								<span>How soon this mightiness meets misery:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, if you can be merry then, I’ll say</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A man may weep upon his wedding-day.</span>
