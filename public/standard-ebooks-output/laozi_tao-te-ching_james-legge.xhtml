He commences by calling it “a thing (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">物</span>);” but that term does not necessitate our regarding it as “material.” We have seen in the preceding chapter that it is used to signify “spirits and men.” Nor does his going on to speak of it as “chaotic (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">混成</span>)” necessarily lead us to conceive it as made up of the “material elements of things;” we have the same term applied in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-14"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 14</a> to the three immaterial constituents there said to be blended in the idea of it.</p>

And to distinguish it from all other methods of evolution, he would call it “the Great Method,” and so he employs that combination as its name in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-18"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 18</a> and elsewhere; but it cannot be said that this name has fully maintained itself in the writings of his followers. But understood thus, he here says, as in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-1"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 1</a>, that it is “the Mother of all things.” And yet, when he says that “it was before Heaven and Earth were produced,” he comes very near his affirmations in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-1">chapters 1</a> and <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-4">4</a>, that “the nameless <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was the beginning (or originating cause) of Heaven and Earth,” and “might seem to have been before God.” Was he groping after God if haply he might find Him? I think he was, and he gets so far as to conceive of Him as “the Uncaused Cause,” but comes short of the idea of His personality. The other subordinate causes which he mentions all get their force or power from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, but after all the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is simply a spontaneity, evolving from itself, and not acting from a personal will, consciously in the direction of its own wisdom and love. “Who can by searching find out God?

With some considerable hesitation I have given the subjects in those paragraphs in the concrete, in deference to the authority of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> and most other commentators. The former says, “By ‘the highest <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>’ is to be understood the rulers of the greatest antiquity, without name or designation, whose virtue was great, and could not be surpassed.” Most ingenious, and in accordance with the Taoistic system, is the manner in which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span> construes the passage, and I am surprised that it has not been generally accepted. By “the higher <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>” he understands, “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>,” that which is prior to and above the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">上德者, 在德之上, 道也</span>); by “the lower <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span>,” benevolence, that which is after and below the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tê</span> which is above benevolence; by “the higher righteousness,” the benevolence which is above righteousness; and by “the higher propriety,” the righteousness which is above propriety. Certainly in the summation of these four paragraphs which we have in the fifth, the subjects of them would appear to have been in the mind of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> as thus defined by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span>.</p>
					<p>In the reminder of the chapter he goes on to speak depreciatingly of ceremonies and knowledge, so that the whole chapter must be understood as descriptive of the process of decay and deterioration from the early time in which the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and its attributes swayed the societies of men. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-74" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

This also enables us to give a fair and consistent explanation of the difficult clause which follows, in which also I have followed the text of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>.

					<p><span xml:lang="zh-Hant">道化</span>, “The Transformations of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.” In <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-42-p-2"><abbr>par.</abbr> 2</a> we have the case of the depreciating epithets given to themselves by kings and princes, which we found before in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-39"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 39</a>, and a similar lesson is drawn from it. Such depreciation leads to exaltation, and the contrary course of self-exaltation leads to abasement. This latter case is stated emphatically in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-42-p-3"><abbr>par.</abbr> 3</a>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> says that it was the basis of his teaching. So far therefore we have in this chapter a repetition of the lesson that “the movement of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is by contraries,” and that its weakness is the sure precursor of strength. But the connection between this lesson and what he says in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-42-p-1"><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</a> it is difficult to trace. Up to this time at least it has baffled myself. The passage seems to give us a cosmogony. “The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> produced One.” We have already seen that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is “The One.” Are we to understand here that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and The One were one and the same? In this case what would be the significance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">生</span> (“produced”)?⁠—that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> which had been previously “non-existent” now became “existent,” or capable of being named? This seem to be the view of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Kuang</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1009⁠–⁠1086).</p>
					<p>The most singular form which this view assumes is in one of the treatises on our <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>, attributed to the Taoist patriarch <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü</span> (<span epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Hant">呂祖道德經解</span>), that “the One is Heaven, which was formed by the congealing of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.” According to another treatise, also assigned to the same <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü</span> (<span epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Hant">道德真經合解</span>), the One was “the primordial ether;” the Two, “the separation of that into its Yin and Yang constituents;” and the Three, “the production of heaven, earth, and man by these.” In quoting the paragraph, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan Tzŭ</span> omits <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">道生一</span>, and commences with <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">一生二</span>, and his glossarist, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kao Yu</span>, makes out the One to be the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, the Two to be Spiritual Intelligences (<span xml:lang="zh-Hant">神明</span>), and the Three to be the Harmonising Breath. From the mention of the Yin and Yang that follows, I believe that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> intended by the Two these two qualities or elements in the primordial ether, which would be “the One.” I dare not hazard a guess as to what “the Three” were. <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-78" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

It is in Buddhism the formula of a peculiar church or religion; in Taoism a rule for the character, or the conduct which the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> demands from all mean. “My <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>” in <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-67-p-1"><abbr>par.</abbr> 1</a> is the reading of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span>; <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung’s</span> text is simply <span xml:lang="zh-Hant">我</span>. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi’s</span> reading is now generally adopted.</p>

The Jesuit version is, “<i xml:lang="la">Celestis <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> natura ditat omnes, nemini nocet;</i>” <span xml:lang="fr">Julien’s</span>, “<i xml:lang="fr">Il est utile aux êtres, et ne leur nuit point;</i>” Chalmers’s, “Benefits and does not injure;” and <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">V.</abbr> von Strauss’s, “<i xml:lang="de">Des Himmels Weise ist wolthun und nicht beschädigen.</i>” <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#noteref-117" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<p>Therefore the sage, in the exercise of his government, empties their minds, fills their bellies, weakens their wills, and strengthens their bones.</p>
				<p>He constantly (tries to) keep them without knowledge and without desire, and where there are those who have knowledge, to keep them from presuming to act (on it).

				<p>Favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared; honour and great calamity, to be regarded as personal conditions (of the same kind).</p>
				<p>What is meant by speaking thus of favour and disgrace? Disgrace is being in a low position (after the enjoyment of favour). The getting that (favour) leads to the apprehension (of losing it), and the losing it leads to the fear of (still greater calamity):⁠—this is what is meant by saying that favour and disgrace would seem equally to be feared.</p>
				<p id="chapter-13-p-3">And what is meant by saying that honour and great calamity are to be (similarly) regarded as personal conditions? What makes me liable to great calamity is my having the body (which I call myself); if I had not the body, what great calamity could come to me?</p>

				<p>The skilful masters (of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>) in old times, with a subtle and exquisite penetration, comprehended its mysteries, and were deep (also) so as to elude men’s knowledge. As they were thus beyond men’s knowledge, I will make an effort to describe of what sort they appeared to be.</p>
				<p>Shrinking looked they like those who wade through a stream in winter; irresolute like those who are afraid of all around them; grave like a guest (in awe of his host); evanescent like ice that is melting away; unpretentious like wood that has not been fashioned into anything; vacant like a valley, and dull like muddy water.</p>

				<p>The (state of) vacancy should be brought to the utmost degree, and that of stillness guarded with unwearying vigour. All things alike go through their processes of activity, and (then) we see them return (to their original state). When things (in the vegetable world) have displayed their luxuriant growth, we see each of them return to its root. This returning to their root is what we call the state of stillness; and that stillness may be called a reporting that they have fulfilled their appointed end.</p>
				<p>The report of that fulfilment is the regular, unchanging rule. To know that unchanging rule is to be intelligent; not to know it leads to wild movements and evil issues. The knowledge of that unchanging rule produces a (grand) capacity and forbearance, and that capacity and forbearance lead to a community (of feeling with all things). From this community of feeling comes a kingliness of character; and he who is king-like goes on to be heaven-like. In that likeness to heaven he possesses the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. Possessed of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, he endures long; and to the end of his bodily life, is exempt from all danger of decay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-52" id="noteref-52" epub:type="noteref">52</a></p>

He is free from self-display, and therefore he shines; from self-assertion, and therefore he is distinguished; from self-boasting, and therefore his merit is acknowledged; from self-complacency, and therefore he acquires superiority.

				<p>Hence, those with whom he agrees as to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> have the happiness of attaining to it; those with whom he agrees as to its manifestation have the happiness of attaining to it; and those with whom he agrees in their failure have also the happiness of attaining (to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>).

				<p>A master of the art of war has said, “I do not dare to be the host (to commence the war); I prefer to be the guest (to act on the defensive).

			<h2 epub:type="title">Was Taoism Older Than <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>?</h2>
			<p>In writing the preface to the third volume of these <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sacred Books of the East</i> in 1879, I referred to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> as “the acknowledged founder” of the system of Taoism. Prolonged study and research, however, have brought me to the conclusion that there was a Taoism earlier than his; and that before he wrote his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>, the principles taught in it had been promulgated, and the ordering of human conduct and government flowing from them inculcated.</p>
			<p>For more than a thousand years “the Three Religions” has been a stereotyped phrase in China, meaning what we call Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism. The phrase itself simply means “the Three Teachings,” or systems of instruction, leaving the subject-matter of each “Teaching” to be learned by inquiry. Of the three, Buddhism is of course the most recent, having been introduced into China only the first century of our Christian era. Both the others were indigenous to the country, and are traceable to a much greater antiquity, so that it is a question to which the earlier origin should be assigned. The years of Confucius’s life lay between <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 551 and 478; but his own acknowledgement that he was “a transmitter and not a maker,” and the testimony of his grandson, that “he handed down the doctrines of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yao</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shun</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 2300), and elegantly displayed the regulations of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wên</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 1200), taking them as his model,” are well known.</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-1-p-3"><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi’s</span> birth is said, in the most likely account of it, to have taken place in the third year of king <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ting</span> of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> dynasty, (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>) 604. He was thus rather more than fifty years older than Confucius. The two men seem to have met more than once, and I am inclined to think that the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, as the designation of the other, arose from Confucius’s styling him to his disciples “The Old Philosopher.” They met as heads of different schools or schemes of thought; but did not touch, so far as we know, on the comparative antiquity of their views. It is a peculiarity of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> that any historical element in it is of the vaguest nature possible, and in all its chapters there is not a single proper name. Yet there are some references to earlier sages whose words the author was copying out, and to “sentence-makers” whose maxims he was introducing to illustrate his own sentiments.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> In the most distant antiquity he saw a happy society in which his highest ideas of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> were realised, and in the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-17">seventeenth chapter</a> he tells us that in the earliest times the people did not know that there were their rulers, and when those rulers were most successful in dealing with them, simply said, “We are what we are of ourselves.” Evidently mean existed to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> at first in a condition of happy innocence⁠—in what we must call a paradisiacal state, according to his idea of what such a state was likely to be.</p>
			<p>When we turn from the treatise of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> to the writings of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, the greatest of his followers, we are not left in doubt as to his belief in an early state of paradisiacal Taoism. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang Ti</span>, the first year of whose reign is placed in <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 2697, is often introduced as a seeker of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and is occasionally condemned as having been one of the first to disturb its rule in men’s minds and break up “the State of Perfect Unity.” He mentions several sovereigns of whom we can hardly find a trace in the records of history as having ruled in the primeval period, and gives us more than one description of the condition of the world during that happy time.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></p>
			<p>I do not think that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> had any historical evidence for the statements which he makes about those early days, the men who flourished in them, and their ways. His narratives are for the most part fictions, in which the names and incidents are of his own devising. They are no more true as matters of fact than the accounts of the characters in Bunyun’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Pilgrim’s Progress</i> are true, with reference to any particular individuals; but as these last are grandly true of myriads of minds in different ages, so may we read in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ’s</span> stories the thoughts of Taoistic men beyond the restrictions of place and time. He believed that those thoughts were as old as the men to whom he attributed them. I find in his belief a ground for believing myself that to Taoism, as well as to Confucianism, we ought to attribute a much earlier origin than the famous men whose names they bear. Perhaps they did not differ so much at first as they came afterwards to do in the hands of Confucius and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, both great thinkers, the one more of a moralist, and the other more of a metaphysician. When and how, if they were ever more akin than they came to be; their divergence took place, are difficult questions on which it may be well to make some remarks after we have tried to set forth the most important principles of Taoism.</p>
			<p>Those principles have to be learned from the treatise of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and the writings of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>. We can hardly say that the Taoism taught in them is the Taoism now current in China, or that has been current in it for many centuries; but in an inquiry into the nature and origin of religions these are the authorities that must be consulted for Taoism, and whose evidence must be accepted. The treatise, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Actions and the Responses to Them</i>, will show one of the phases of it at a much later period.</p>

			<p id="translators-intro-2-p-1">I will now state briefly, first, the grounds on which I accept the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> as a genuine production of the age to which it has been assigned, and the truth of its authorship by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> to whom it has been ascribed. It would not have been necessary a few years ago to write as if these points could be called in question, but in 1886 <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Herbert <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Giles, of Her Majesty’s Consular Service in China, and one of the ablest Chinese scholars living, vehemently called them in question in an article in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">China Review</i> for the months of March and April. His strictures have been replied to, and I am not going to revive here the controversy which they produced, but only to state a portion of the evidence which satisfies my own mind on the two points just mentioned.</p>
			<p>It has been said above that the year <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 604 was, probably, that of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi’s</span> birth. The year of his death is not recorded. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span>, the first great Chinese historian, who died in about <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 85, commences his <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">“Biographies”</span> with a short account of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>. He tells us that the philosopher had been a curator of the Royal Library of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, and that, mourning over the decadence of the dynasty, he wished to withdraw from the world, and proceeded to the pass or defile of Hangu,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> leading from China to the west. There he was recognised by the warden of the pass, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yin Hsi</span> (often called <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuan Yin</span>), himself a well-known Taoist, who insisted on his leaving him a writing before he went into seclusion. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> then wrote his views on <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and its Characteristics</i>, in two parts or sections, containing more than 5,000 characters, gave the manuscript to the warden, and went his way;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> “nor is it known where he died.” This account is strange enough, and we need not wonder that it was by and by embellished with many marvels. It contains, however, the definite statements that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> wrote the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> in two parts, and consisting of more than 5,000 characters. And that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> was himself well acquainted with the treatise is apparent from his quotations from it, with, in almost every case, the specification of the author. He thus adduces part of the first chapter, and a large portion of the last chapter but one. His brief reference also to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and his writings are numerous.</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-2-p-3">But between <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span> there were many Taoist writers whose works remain. I may specify of them <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzŭ</span> (assuming that his chapters, though not composed in their present form by him, may yet be accepted as fair specimens of his teaching); <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> (of the fourth century <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>. We find him refusing to accept high office from king <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽu</span>, <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 339⁠–⁠299); <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span>, a voluminous author, who died by his own hand in <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 230; and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liu An</span>, a scion of the Imperial House of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span>, king of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan</span>, and better known to us as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huan-nan Tzŭ</span>, who also died by his own hand in <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 122. In the books of all these men we find quotations of many passages that are in our treatise. They are expressly said to be, many of them, quotations from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>; <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> several times all but shows the book beneath his eyes. To show how numerous the quotations by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liu An</span> are, let it be borne in mind that the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> has come down to us as divided into eighty-one short chapters; and that the whole of it is shorter than the shortest of our <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Gospels</span>. Of the eighty-one chapters, either the whole or portions of seventy-one are found in those two writers. There are other authors not so decidedly Taoistic, in whom we find quotations from the little book. These quotations are in general wonderfully correct. Various readings indeed there are; but if we were sure that the writers did trust to memory, their differences would only prove that copies of the text had been multiplied from the very first.</p>
			<p>In passing on from quotations to the complete text, I will clinch the assertion that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> was well acquainted with our treatise, by a passage from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of the Former <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span> Dynasty</i> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 206⁠–⁠<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 24), which was begun to be compiled by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Ku</span>, who died however in 92, and left a portion to be completed by his sister, the famous <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chao</span>. The thirty-second chapter of his <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">“Biographies”</span> is devoted to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span>, and towards the end it is said that “on the subject of the Great <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> he preferred <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> to the six <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ching</i>.” “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>” must there be the writings of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang Ti</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>. The association of the two names also illustrates the antiquity claimed for Taoism, and the subject of <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4">endnote 4</a>.</p>
			<p>We go on from quotations to complete texts, and turn, first, to the catalogue of the Imperial Library of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span>, as compiled by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liu Hsin</span>, not later than the commencement of our Christian era. There are entered in it Taoist works by thirty-seven different authors, containing in all 993 chapters or sections (<i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">pʽien</i>). <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yi Yin</span>, the premier of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽêng Tʽang</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 1766), heads the list with fifty-one sections. There are in it four editions of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi’s</span> work with commentaries:⁠—by a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lin, in four sections; a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fu, in thirty-seven sections; a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hsü, in six sections; and by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liu Hsiang</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsin’s</span> own father, in four sections. All these four works have since perished, but there they were in the Imperial Library before our era began. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> is in the same list in fifty-two books or sections, the greater part of which have happily escaped the devouring tooth of time.</p>
			<p>We turn now to the twentieth chapter of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien’s</span> <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">“Biographies”</span>, in which he gives an account of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yüeh Yi</span>, the scion of a distinguished family, and who himself played a famous part, both as a politician and military leader, and became prince of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang-chu</span> under the kingdom of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> in <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 279. Among his descendants was a <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yüeh Chʽên</span>, who learned in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span> “the words,” that is, the Taoistic writings “of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang Ti</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> from an old man who lived on the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ho</i>-side.” The origin of this old man was not known, but <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yüeh Chʽên</span> taught what he learned from him to a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ko</span>, who again became preceptor to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsʽao Tsʽan</span>, the chief minister of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span>, and afterwards of the new dynasty of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span>, dying in <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 190.</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-2-p-7">Referring now to the catalogue of the Imperial Library of the dynasty of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sui</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 502⁠–⁠556), we find that it containd many editions of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> treatise with commentaries. The first mentioned is <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</span></i>, with the commentary of the old man of the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ho</i>-side, in the time of the emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wên</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 179⁠–⁠142). It is added in a note that the dynasty of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liang</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 502⁠–⁠556) had possessed the edition of “the old man of the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ho</i>-side, of the time of the Warring States; but that with some other texts and commentaries it had disappeared.” I find it difficult to believe that there had been two old men of the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ho</i>-side,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> both teachers of Taoism and commentators on our <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>, but I am willing to content myself with the more recent work, and accept the copy that has been current⁠—say from <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 150, when <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span> could have been little more than a boy. Taoism was a favourite study with many of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span> emperors and their ladies. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huai-nan Tzŭ</span>, of whose many quotations from the text of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> I have spoken, was an uncle of the emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wên</span>. To emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 156⁠–⁠143), the son of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wên</span>, there is attributed the designation of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> treatise as a <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ching</i>, a work of standard authority. At the beginning of his reign, we are told, some one was commending to him four works, among which were those of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>. Deeming that the work of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-tzŭ</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> was of a deeper character than the others, he ordered that it should be called a <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ching</i>, established a board for the study of Taoism, and issued an edict that the book should be learned and recited at court, and throughout the country.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> Thenceforth it was so styled. We find <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-fu Mi</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 215⁠–⁠282) referring to it as the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tao Te Ching</i>.</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-2-p-8">The second place in the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sui</span> catalogue is given to the text and commentary of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span> or <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Fu-ssŭ</span>, an extraordinary scholar who died in <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 249, at the early age of twenty-four. This work has always been much prized. It was its text which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu Tê-ming</span> used in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Explanation of the Terms and Phrases of the Classics</i>, in the seventh century. Among the editions of it which I possess is that printed in 1794 with the imperial moveable metal types.</p>
			<p>I need not speak of editions or commentaries subsequent to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi’s</span>. They soon begin to be many, and are only not so numerous as those of the Confucian Classics.</p>
			<p>All the editions of the book are divided into two parts, the former called <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">“Tao”</span>, and the latter <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">“Tê”</span>, meaning the Qualities or Characteristics of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, but this distinction of subjects is by no means uniformly adhered to.</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-2-p-11">I referred already to the division of the whole into eighty-one short chapters (37 + 44), which is by common tradition attributed to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, or “The old man of the <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">ho</i>-side.” Another very early commentator, called <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen Tsun</span> or <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen Chün-ping</span>, made a division into seventy-two chapters (40 + 32), under the influence, no doubt, of some mystical considerations. His predecessor, perhaps, had no better reason for his eighty-one; but the names of his chapters were, for the most part, happily chosen, and have been preserved. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span> arranged the two parts in sixty-seven chapters (31 + 36). It is a mistake, however, to suppose, as even <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wylie with all his general accuracy did,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span> “curtails the ordinary text to some extent.” He does not curtail, but only rearranges according to his fashion, uniting some of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung’s</span> chapters in one, and sometimes altering the order their clauses.</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span> tells us that, as the treatise came from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, it contained more than 5,000 characters; that is, as one critic says, “more than 5,000 and fewer than 6,000.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung’s</span> text has 5,350, and one copy 5,590; <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi’s</span>, 5,683, and one copy 5,610. Two other early texts have been counted, giving 5,720 and 5,635 characters respectively. The brevity arises from the terse conciseness of the style, owing mainly to the absence of the embellishment of particles, which forms so striking a peculiarity in the composition of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Mencius</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i>.</p>
			<p>In passing on to speak, secondly and more briefly, of the far more voluminous writings of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, I may say that I do not know of any other book so ancient a date as the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>, of which the authenticity of the origin and genuineness of the text can claim to be so well substantiated.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">What Is the Meaning of the Name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>? And the Chief Points of the Belief in Taoism</h2>
			<p id="translators-intro-3-p-1">The first translation of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> into a western language was executed in Latin by some of the Roman Catholic missionaries, and a copy of it was brought to England by a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Matthew Raper, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">F.R.S.</abbr>, and presented by him to the Society at a meeting on the 10th January, 1788⁠—being the gift to him of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Jos.</abbr> de <span xml:lang="fr">Grammont</span>, <i xml:lang="la">Missionarius Apostolicus, ex-Jesuita</i>. In this version <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is taken in the sense of “ratio,” or the “supreme reason of the divine being, the creator and governor.”</p>
			<p><abbr>M.</abbr> <span xml:lang="fr">Abel-Rémusat</span>, the first professor of Chinese in Paris, does not seem to have been aware of the existence of the above version in London, but his attention was attracted to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> treatise about 1820, and, in 1823, he wrote of the character <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, “<i xml:lang="fr">Ce mot me semble ne pas pouvoir être bien traduit, si ce n’est par le mot</i> <i xml:lang="grc">λόγος</i> <i xml:lang="fr">dans le triple sense de souverain Être, de raison, et de parole.</i>”</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="fr">Rémusat’s</span> successor in the chair of Chinese, the late <span xml:lang="fr">Stanislas Julien</span>, published in 1842 a translation of the whole treatise. Having concluded from an examination of it, and the earliest Taoist writers, such as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-kuan Tzŭ</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was devoid of action, of thought, of judgement, and of intelligence, he concluded that it was impossible to understand by it “the primordial reason, or the sublime intelligence which created, and which governs the world,” and to this he subjoined the following note:⁠—“<i xml:lang="fr">Quelque étrange que puisse paraître cette idée de</i> <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</i>, <i xml:lang="fr">elle n’est pas sans exemple dans l’histoire de la philosophie. Le mot nature n’a-t-il pas été employee par certains philosophes, que la religion et la raison condamnent, pour désigner une cause première, également dépourvue de pensée et d’intelligence?</i>” <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span> himself did not doubt that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> idea of the character was that it primarily and properly meant “a way,” and hence he translated the title <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> by <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Le Livre de la Voie et de la Vertu</i>, transferring at the same time the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> to the text of his version.</p>
			<p>The first English writer who endeavoured to give a distinct account of Taoism was the late Archdeacon Hardwick, while he held the office of Christian Advocate in the University of Cambridge. In his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Christ and Other Masters</i> (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">ii</span> <abbr>p.</abbr> 67), when treating of the religions of China, he says, “I feel disposed to argue that the centre of the system founded by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> had been awarded to some energy or power resembling the ‘nature’ of modern speculators. The indefinite expression <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was adopted to denominate an abstract cause, or the initial principle of life and order, to which worshippers were able to assign the attributes of immateriality, eternity, immensity, invisibility.”</p>
			<p>It was, probably, <span xml:lang="fr">Julien’s</span> reference in his note to the use of the term nature, which suggested to Hardwick his analogy between <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi’s Tao</span>, and “the nature of modern speculation.” Canon Farrar has said, “We have long personified under the name of nature the sum total of God’s laws as observed in the physical world; and now the notion of nature as a distinct, living, independent entity seems to be ineradicable alike from our literature and our systems of philosophy.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> But it seems to me that this metaphorical or mythological use of the word nature for the cause and ruler of it, implies the previous notion of Him, that is, of God, in the mind. Does not this clearly appear in the words of Seneca?⁠—“<i xml:lang="la">Vis illum (<abbr>h.e.</abbr> Jovem Deum) naturam vocare, non peccabis:⁠—hic est ex quo nata sunt omnia, cujus spiritu vivimus.</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></p>
			<p>In his translation of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Works of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span></i> in 1881, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour adopted Nature as the ordinary rendering of the Chinese <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. He says, “When the word is translated Way of Nature⁠—her processes, her methods, and her laws; when translated Reason, it is the same as <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">li</i>⁠—the power that works in all created things, producing, preserving, and life-giving⁠—the intelligent principle of the world; when translated Doctrine, it refers to the true doctrine respecting the laws the mysteries of Nature.” He calls attention also to the point that “he uses <strong>nature</strong> in the sense of <i xml:lang="la">Natura naturans</i>, while the Chinese expression <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">wan wu</i> (= all things) denotes <i xml:lang="la">Natura naturata</i>.” But this really comes to the metaphorical use of nature which has been touched upon above. It can claim as its patrons great names like those of Aquinas, Giordano Bruno, and Spinoza, but I have never been able to see that its barbarous phraseology makes it more than a figure of speech.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></p>
			<p>The term Nature, however, is so handy, and often fits so appropriately into a version, that if <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> had ever such a signification I should not hesitate to employ it as freely as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour has done; but as it has not that signification, to try to put a non-natural meaning into it, only perplexes the mind, and obscures the idea of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>.</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-3-p-8"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour himself says, “The primary signification of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is simply ‘road.’ ” Beyond question this meaning underlies the use of it by the great master of Taoism and by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a> Let the reader refer to the version of the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-25">twenty-fifth chapter</a> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> treatise, and to the <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-51">notes</a> subjoined to it. There <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> appears as the spontaneously operating cause of all movement in the phenomena of the universe; and the nearest the writer can come to a name for it is “the Great <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.” Having established this name, he subsequently uses it repeatedly; see <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-34"><abbr>chh.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xxxiv</span></a> and <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-53" epub:type="z3998:roman">liii</a>. In the third paragraph of his twentieth chapter, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> uses a synonymous phrase instead of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> “Great <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>,” calling it the “Great <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽu</span>,” about which there can be no dispute, as meaning “the Great Path,” “Way,” or “Course.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a> In the last paragraph his twenty-fifth book, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> again sets forth the metaphorical origin of the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>,” he says, “cannot be regarded as having a positive existence; existences cannot be regarded as nonexistent. The name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is a metaphor used for the purpose of description. To say that it exercises some causation, or that it does nothing, is speaking of it from the phase of a thing;⁠—how can such language serve as a designation of it in its greatness? If words were sufficient for the purpose, we might in a day’s time exhaust the subject of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. Words not being sufficient, we may talk about it the whole day, and the subject of discourse will only have been a thing. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is the extreme to which things conduct us. Neither speech nor silence is sufficient to convey the notion of it. When we neither speak nor refrain from speech, our speculations about it reach their highest point.”</p>
			<p>The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> therefore is a phenomenon; not a positive being, but a mode of being. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> idea of it may become plainer as we proceed to other points of his system. In the meaning time, the best way of dealing with it in translating is to transfer it to the version, instead of trying to introduce an English equivalent of it.</p>
			<p>Next in importance to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien</span>, meaning at first the vaulted sky or the open firmament of heaven. In the Confucian Classics, and in the speech of the Chinese people, this name is used metaphorically as it is by ourselves for the Supreme Being, with reference especially to His will and rule. So it was that the idea of God arose among the Chinese fathers; so it was that they proceeded to fashion a name for God, calling Him <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shang Ti</span>, “the Ruler,” and “the Supreme Ruler.” The Taoist fathers found this among their people; but in their idea of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> they had already a supreme concept which superseded the necessity of any other. The name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span> for God only occurs once in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>; in the well-known passage of the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-4">fourth chapter</a>, where, speaking of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> says, “I do not know whose son it is; it might seem to be before God.”</p>
			<p id="translators-intro-3-p-11">Nor is the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien</span> very common. We have the phrase, “heaven and earth,” used for the two great constituents of the cosmos, owing their origin to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, and also for a sort of binomial power, acting in harmony with the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, covering, protecting, nurturing, and maturing all things. Never once is <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien</span> used in the sense of God, the Supreme Being. In its peculiarly Taoistic employment, it is more an adjective than a noun. “The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> of heaven” means the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> that is heavenly, the course that is quiet and undemonstrative, that is free from motive and effort, such as is seen in the processes of nature, grandly proceeding and successful without any striving or crying. The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> of man, not dominated by this <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, is contrary to it, and shows will, purpose, and effort, till, submitting to it, it becomes “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> or Way of the sages,” which in all its action has no striving.</p>
			<p>The characteristics both of heaven and man are dealt with more fully by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> than by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>. In the conclusion of his eleventh book, for instance, he says:⁠—“What do we mean by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>? There is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> (or Way) of heaven, and there is the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> of man. Acting without action, and yet attracting all honour, is the Way of heaven. Doing and being embarrassed thereby is the Way of man. The Way of heaven should play the part of lord; the Way of man, the part of minister. The two are far apart, and should be distinguished from each other.”</p>
			<p>In his next book, (<abbr>par.</abbr> 2), <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> tells us what he intends by “Heaven:”⁠—“Acting without action⁠—this is what is called heaven.” Heaven thus taken its law from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. “The oldest sages and sovereigns attained to do the same,”⁠—it was for all men to aim at the same achievement. As they were successful, “vacancy, stillness, placidity, tastelessness, quietude, silence, and non-action” would be found to be their characteristics, and they would go on to the perfection of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a></p>
			<p>The employment of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien</span> by the Confucianists, as of heaven by ourselves, must be distinguished therefore from the Taoistic use of the name to denote the quiet but mighty influence of the impersonal <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>; and to translate it by “God” only obscures the meaning of the Taoist writers. The has been done by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles in his version of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i>, which is otherwise for the most part so good. Everywhere on his pages there appears the great name “God;”⁠—a blot on his translation more painful to my eyes and ears than the use of “Nature” for <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour. I know that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles’s plan in translating is to use strictly English equivalents for all kinds of Chinese terms.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> The plan is good where there are in the two languages such strict equivalents; but in the case before us there is no ground for its application. The exact English equivalent for the Chinese <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tʽien</i> is our heaven. The Confucianists often used <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tʽien</i> metaphorically for the personal being whom they denominated <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span> (God) and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shang Ti</span> (the Supreme God), and a translator may occasionally, in working on books of Confucian literature, employ our name God for it. But neither <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> nor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> ever attached anything like our idea of God to it; and when one, in working on books of early Taoist literature, translates <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tʽien</i> by God, such a rendering must fail to produce in an English reader a correct apprehension of the meaning.</p>
			<p>There is also in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i> a peculiar usage of the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien</span>. He applies it to the being whom he introduces as masters of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, generally with mystical appellations in order to set forth his own views. Two instances from book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> will suffice in illustration of this. In par. 4, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span> does reverence to his instructor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuang Chʽêng-tzŭ</span>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a> saying, “In <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuang Chʽêng-tzŭ</span> we have an example of what is called heaven,” which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles renders “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuang Chʽêng-tzŭ</span> is surely God.” In <abbr>par.</abbr> 5, again, the mystical <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yün-chiang</span> is made to say to the equally fabulous and mystical <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hung-mêng</span>, “O heaven, have you forgotten me?” and, farther on, “O heaven, you have conferred on me (the knowledge of) your operation, and revealed to me the mystery of it;” in both passages <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles renders <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">tʽien</i> by “your holiness.”</p>
			<p>But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles seems to agree with me that the old Taoist had no idea of a personal God, when they wrote of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien</span> or Heaven. On his sixty-eighth page, near the beginning of book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, we meet with the following sentence, having every appearance of being translated from the Chinese text:⁠—“God is a principle which exists by virtue of its own intrinsicality, and operates without self-manifestation.” By an inadvertence he has introduced his own definition of “God” as if it were <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ’s</span>; and though I can find no characters in the text of which I can suppose that he intends it to be the translation, it is valuable as helping us to understand the meaning to be attached to the great name in his volume.</p>
			<p>I have referred above (<a href="#translators-intro-3-p-11"><abbr>par.</abbr> 11</a>) to the only passage in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> treatise, where he uses the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span> or God in its highest sense, saying that “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> might seem to have been before him.” He might well say so, for his first chapter he describes the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, “(conceived of as) having no name, as the originator of heaven and earth, and (conceived of as) having a name, as the mother of all things.” The reader will also find the same predicates of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> at greater length in his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-51">fifty-first chapter</a>.</p>
			<p>The character <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span> is also of rare occurrence in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i>, excepting as applied to the five ancient <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tis</span>. In <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 4, and in one other place we find it indicating the Supreme Being, but the usage is ascribed to the ancients. In <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 3, in a description of the human <strong>spirit</strong>, its name is said to be “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽung Ti</span>”, which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles renders “Of God;” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour, “One with God;” while my own version is “The divinity in man.” In <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 6, we have the expression “the place of God;” in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles, “the kingdom of God;” in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour, “the home of God.” In this and the former instance, the character seems to be used with the ancient meaning which had entered into folklore of the people. But in <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 7, there is passage which shows clearly the relative position of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span> in the Taoistic system; and having called attention to it, I will go on to other points. Let the reader mark well the following predicates of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>:⁠—“Before there were heaven and earth, form of old, there it was, securely existing. From it came the mysterious existence of spirits; from it the mysterious existence of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span> (God). It produced heaven, it produced earth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a> This says more than the utterance of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>⁠—that “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> seemed to be before God;”⁠—does it not say that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> was before God, and that He was what He is by virtue of its operation?</p>
			<p>Among the various personal names given to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> are those of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsao Hua</span>, “maker and transformer,” and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsao Wu Chê</span>, “maker of things.” Instances of both these names are found in <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> <abbr>parr.</abbr> 9, 10. “Creator” and “God” have both been employed for them; but there is no idea of creation in Taoism.</p>
			<p>Again and again <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> entertains the question of how it was at the first beginning of things. Different views are stated. In <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 4, he says:⁠—“Among the men of old their knowledge reached the extreme point. What was that extreme point?</p>
			<p>“Some held that at first there was not anything. This is the extreme point⁠—the utmost limit to which nothing can be added.</p>
			<p>“A second class held that there was something, but without any responsive recognition of it (on the part of man).</p>
			<p>“A third class held that there was such recognition, but there had not begun to be any expression of different opinions about it. It was through the definite expression of different opinions about it that there ensued injury to the (doctrine of the) <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a></p>
			<p>The first of these three views was that which <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> himself preferred. The most condensed expression of it is given in <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 8:⁠—“In the grand beginning of all things there was nothing in all the vacancy of space; there was nothing that could be name.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a> It was in this state that there arose the first existence; the first existence, but still without bodily shape. From this things could be produced, (receiving) what we call their several characters. That which had no bodily shape was divided, and then without intermission there was what we call the process of conferring. (The two processes) continued to operate, and things were produced. As they were completed, there appeared the distinguishing lines of each, which we call the bodily shape. That shape was the body preserving in it the spirit, and each had its peculiar manifestation which we call it nature.”</p>
			<p>Such was the genesis of things; the formation of heaven and earth and all that in them is, under the guidance of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. It was an evolution and not a creation. How the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> itself came⁠—I do not say into existence, but into operation⁠—neither <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> nor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> ever thought of saying anything about. We have seen that it is nothing material.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> It acted spontaneously of itself. Its sudden appearance in the field of nonexistence, producer, transformer, beautifier, surpasses my comprehension. To <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> it seemed to be before God. I am compelled to accept the existence of God, as the ultimate Fact, bowing before it with reverence, and not attempting to explain it, the one mystery, the sole mystery of the universe.</p>
			<p>“The bodily shape was the body preserving in it the spirit, and each had its peculiar manifestation which we call its nature.” So it is said in the passage quoted above <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ’s</span> twelfth book, and the language shows how Taoism, in a loose and indefinite way, considered man to be composed of body and spirit, associated together, yet not necessarily dependent on each other. Little is found bearing on his tenet in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>. The concluding sentence of <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-33"><abbr>ch.</abbr> 33</a>, “He who dies and yet does not perish, has longevity,” is of doubtful acceptation. More pertinent is the description of life as “a coming forth,” and of death as “an entering;”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a> but <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> expounds more fully, though after all unsatisfactorily, the teaching of their system on the subject.</p>
			<p>At the conclusion of his third book, writing of the death of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, he says, “When the master came, it was at the proper time; when he went away, it was the simple sequence (of his coming). Quiet acquiescence in what happens at its proper time, and quietly submitting (to its sequence), afford no occasion for grief or for joy. The ancients described (death) as the loosening of the cord on which God suspended (the life). What we can point to are the faggots that have been consumed; but the fire is transmitted elsewhere, and we know not that it is over and ended.”</p>
			<p>It is, however, in connection with the death of his own wife, as related in the eighteenth book, that his views most fully⁠—I do not say “clearly”⁠—appear. We are told that when that event took place, his friend <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hui-tzŭ</span> went to condole with him, and found him squatted on the ground, drumming on the vessel (of ice), and singing. His friend said to him, “When a wife has lived with her husband, brought up children, and then dies in her old age, not to wail for her is enough. When you go on to drum on the vessel and sing, is it not an excessive (and strange) demonstration?” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> replied, “It is not so. When she first died, was it possible for me to be singular, and not affected by the event? But I reflected on the commencement of her being, when she had not yet been born to life. Not only had she no life, but she had no bodily form. Not only had she no bodily form, but she had no breath. Suddenly in this chaotic condition there ensued a change, and there was breath; another change, and there was the bodily form; a further change, and she was born to life; a change no again, and she is dead. The relation between those changes is like the procession of the four seasons⁠—spring, autumn, winter, and summer. There she lies with her face up, sleeping in the Great Chamber;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a> and if I were to fall sobbing and going on to wail for her, I should think I did not understand what was appointed for all. I therefore restrained myself.”</p>
			<p>The next paragraph of the same book contains another story about two ancient men, both deformed, who, when looking at the graves on Kunlun, begin to feel in their own frames the symptoms of approaching dissolution. One says to the other, “Do you dread it?” and gets the reply, “No. Why should I dread it? Life is a borrowed thing. The living frame thus borrowed is but so much dust. Life and death are like day and night.”</p>
			<p>In every birth, it would thus appear, there is, somehow, a repetition of what it is said, as we have seen, took place at “the grand beginning of all things,” when out of the primal nothingness, the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> somehow appeared, and there was developed through its operation the world of things⁠—material things and the material body of man, which enshrines or enshrouds an immaterial spirit. This returns to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> that gave it, and may be regarded indeed as that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> operating in the body during the time of life, and in due time receives a new embodiment.</p>
			<p>In these notions of Taoism there was preparation for the appreciation by its followers of the Buddhistic system when it came to be introduced into the country, and which forms a close connection between the two at the present day, Taoism itself constantly becoming less definite and influential on the minds of the Chinese people. The book which tells us of the death of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ’s</span> wife concludes with a narrative about <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lieh-tzŭ</span> and an old bleached skull,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a> and to this is appended a passage about the metamorphoses of things, ending with the statement that “the panther produces the horse, and the horse the man, who then again enters into the great machinery (of evolution), from which all things come forth (at birth) and into which they reenter (at death).” Such representations need not be characterised.</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu Hsi</span>, “the prince of literature,” described the main object of Taoism to be “the preservation of the breath of life;” and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liu Mi</span>, probably of our thirteenth century,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a> in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Dispassionate Comparison of the Three Religions</i>, declared that “its chief achievement is the prolongation of longevity.” Such is the account of Taoism originality given by Confucian and Buddhist writers, but our authorities, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span>, hardly bear out this representation of it as true of their time. There are chapters of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> which presuppose a peculiar management of the breath, but the treatise is singularly free from anything to justify what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour well calls “the antics of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">kung-fu</span>, or system of mystic and recondite calisthenics.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> insists, however, on the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> as conducive to long life, and in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> we have references to it as discipline of longevity, though even he mentions rather with disapproval “those who kept blowing and breathing with open mouth, inhaling and exhaling the breath, expelling the old and taking in new; passing their time like the (dormant) bear, and stretching and twisting (their necks) like birds.” He says that “all this simply shows their desire for longevity, and is what the scholars who manage the breath, and men who nourish the body and wish to live as long as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pʽêng-tsu</span>, are fond of doing.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a> My own opinion is that the methods of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> were first cultivated for the sake of the longevity which they were thought to promote, and that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>, discountenancing such a use of them, endeavoured to give the doctrine a higher character; and this view is favoured by passages in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i>. In the seventh paragraph, for instance, of his book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, speaking of parties who had obtained the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, he begins with a prehistoric sovereign, who “got and by it adjusted heaven and earth.” Among his other instances in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pʽêng Tsu</span>, who got it in the time of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shun</span>, and lived on to the time of the five leading princes of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>⁠—a longevity of more than 1,800 years, greater than that ascribed to Methuselah! In the paragraph that follows there appear a <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Nü Yü</span>, who is addressed by another famous Taoist in the words, “You are old, sir, while your complexion is like that of a child;⁠—how is it so?” and the reply is, “I became acquainted with the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.”</p>
			<p>I will adduce only one more passage of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</i>. In his eleventh book, and the fourth paragraph, he tells us of interviews between <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>, in the nineteenth year of his reign, which would be <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 2679, and his instructor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuang Chʽêng-tzŭ</span>. The Taoist sage is not redily prevailed on to unfold the treasures of his knowledge to the sovereign, but at last his reluctance is overcome, and he says to him, “Come, and I will tell you about the perfect <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>. Its essence is surrounded with the deepest obscurity; its highest reach is in darkness and silence. There is nothing to be seen, nothing to be heard. When it holds the spirit in its arms in stillness, then the bodily form will of itself become correct. You must be still, you must be pure; not subjecting your body to toil, not agitating your vital force:⁠—then you may live for long. When your eyes see nothing, your ears hear nothing, and your mind knows nothing, your spirit will keep your body, and the body will live long. Watch over what is within you; shut up the avenues that connect you with what is external;⁠—much knowledge is pernicious. I will proceed with you to the summit of the Grand Brilliance, where we come to the bright and expanding (element); I will enter with you the grate of the dark and depressing element. There heaven and earth have their controllers, there the yin and yang have their repositories. Watch over and keep your body, and all things will of themselves give it vigour. I main the (original) unity (of these elements). In this way I have cultivated myself for 1,200 years, and my bodily form knows no decay.” Add 1,200 to 2,679, and we obtain 3879 as the year <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuang Chʽêng-tzŭ’s</span> birth!</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> describes some other and kindred results of cultivating the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> in terms which are sufficiently startling, and which it is difficult to accept. In his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-50">fiftieth chapter</a> he says, “He who is skilful in managing his life travels on land without having to shun rhinoceros or tiger, and enter a host without having avoid buff coat or sharp weapon. The rhinoceros finds no place in him into which to thrust its horn, nor the tiger a place in which to fix its claws, nor the weapon a place to admit its point. And for what reason? Because there is in him no place of death.” To the same effect he says in his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-55">fifty-fifth chapter</a>, “He who has in himself abundantly the attributes (of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>) is like an infant. Poisonous insects will not sting him; fierce beasts will not seize him; birds of prey will not strike him.”</p>
			<p>Such assertions startle us by their contrariety to our observation and experience, but so does most of the teaching of Taoism. What can seem more absurd than the declaration that “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> does nothing, and so there is nothing that it does not do?” And yet this is one of the fundamental axioms of the system. The <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-37">thirty-seventh chapter</a>, which enunciates it, goes on to say, “If princes and kings were able to maintain (the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>), all things would of themselves be transformed by them.” This principle, if we can call it so, is generalised in the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-40">fortieth</a>, one of the shortest chapters, and partly in rhyme:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">

			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span>, or whoever gave their names to the chapters of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>, styles this <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-40">fortieth chapter</a> “Dispensing with the use (of means).” If the wish to use means arise in the mind, the nature of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> as “the nameless simplicity” has been vitiated; and this nature is celebrated in lines like those just quoted:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">

				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>I do not cull any passages from <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</i> to illustrate these points. In his eleventh book his subject is government by “Let-a-be and the exercise of forbearance.”</p>
			<p>This <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> ruled men at first, and then the world was in a paradisiacal state. Neither of our authorities tells us how long this condition lasted, but as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> observes in his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-18">eighteenth chapter</a>, “the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> ceased to be observed.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, however, gives us more than one description of what he considered the paradisiacal state was. He calls it “the age of perfect virtue.” In the thirteenth paragraph of his twelfth book he says, “In this age, they attached no value to wisdom, nor employed men of ability. Superiors were (but) as the higher branches of a tree; and the people were like the deer of the wild. They were upright and correct, without knowing that to be so was righteousness; they loved one another, without knowing that to do so was benevolence; they were honest and leal-hearted, without knowing that it was loyalty; they fulfilled their engagements, without knowing that to do so was good faith; in their movements they employed the services of one another, without thinking that they were conferring or receiving any gift. Therefore their actions left no trace, and there was no record of their affairs.”</p>
			<p>Again, in the fourth paragraph of his tenth book, addressing an imaginary interlocutor, he says, “Are you, Sir, unacquainted with the age of perfect virtue?” He then gives the names of twelve sovereigns who ruled in it, of the greater number of whom we have no other means of knowing anything, and goes on:⁠—“In their times the people used knotted cords in carrying on their business. They thought their (simple) food pleasant, and their (plain) clothing beautiful. They were happy in their (simple) manners, and felt at rest in their (poor) dwellings. (The people of) neighbouring states might be able to descry one another; the voices of their cocks and dogs might be heard from one to the other; they might not die till they were old; and yet all their life they would have no communication together. In those times perfect good order prevailed.”</p>
			<p>One other description of the primeval state is still more interesting. It is in the second paragraph of <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>:⁠—“The people had their regular and constant nature:⁠—they wove and made themselves clothes; they tilled the ground and got food. This was their common faculty. They were all one in this, and did not for themselves into separate classes; so were they constituted and left to their natural tendencies. Therefore in the age of perfect virtue men walked along with slow and grave step, and with their looks steadily directed forwards. On the hills there were no footpaths nor exacted passages; on the lakes there were no boats nor dams. All creatures lived in companies, and their places of settlement were made near to one another. Birds and beasts multiplied to flocks and herds; the grass and trees grew luxuriant and long. The birds and beasts might be led about without feeling the constraint; the nest of the magpie might be climbed to, and peeped into. Yes, in the age of perfect virtue, men lived in common with birds and beasts, and were on terms of equality with all creatures, as forming one family;⁠—how could they know among themselves the distinctions of superior men and small men? Equally without knowledge, they did not leave the path of their natural virtue; equally free from desires, they were in the state of pure simplicity. In their pure simplicity, their nature was what it ought to be.”</p>
			<p>Such were the earliest Chinese of whom <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> could venture to give any account. If ever their ancestors had been in a ruder or savage condition, it must have been at a much antecedent time. These had long passed out of such a state; they were tillers of the ground, and acquainted with the use of the loom. They lived in happy relations with one another, and in kindly harmony with the tribes of inferior creatures. But there is not the slightest allusion to any sentiment of piety as animating them individually, or to any ceremony of religion as observed by them in common. This surely is a remarkable feature in their condition. I call attention to it, but I do not dwell upon it.</p>
			<p>But by the time of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> the cultivation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> had fallen into disuse. The simplicity of life which it demanded, with its freedom from all disturbing speculation and action, was no longer to be found in individual or in government. It was the general decay of manners and of social order which unsettled the mind <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>, made him resign his position as curator of the Royal Library, and determine to withdraw from China and hide himself among the rude peoples beyond it. The cause of the deterioration of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and of all the evils of the nation was attributed to the ever-growing pursuit of knowledge, and of what we call the arts of culture. It had commenced very long before;⁠—in the time of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Huang-ti</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> says in one place;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a> and in another he carries it still higher to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sui-jên</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu-hsi</span>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a> There had been indeed, all along the line of history, a grouping for the rules of life, as indicated by the constitution of man’s nature. The results were embodied in the ancient literature which was the lifelong study of Confucius. He had gathered up that literature; he recognised the nature of man as the gift of heaven or God. The monitions of God as given in the convictions of man’s mind supplied him with a <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> or path of duty very different from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> or mysterious way of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>. All this was gall and wormwood to the dreaming librarian or brooding recluse, and made him say, “If we could renounce our sageness and discard our wisdom, it would be better for the people a hundredfold. If we could renounce our benevolence and discard our righteousness, the people would again become filial and kindly. If we could renounce our artful contrivances and discard our (scheming for) gain, there would be no thieves nor robbers.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></p>
			<p>We can laugh at this. Taoism was wrong in its opposition to the increase of knowledge. Man exists under a law of progress. In pursuing it there are demanded discretion and justice. Moral ends must rule over material ends, and advance in virtue be ranked higher than advance in science. So have good and evil, truth and error, to fight out the battle on the field of the world, and in all the range of time; but there is no standing still for the individual or for society. Even Confucius taught his countrymen to set too high a value on the examples of antiquity. The school of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> fixing themselves in an unknown region beyond antiquity⁠—a prehistoric time between “the grand beginning of all things” out of nothing, and the unknown commencement of societies of men⁠—has made no advance but rather retrograded, and is represented by the still more degenerated Taoism of the present day.</p>
			<p>There is a short parabolic story of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, intended to represent the antagonism between Taoism and knowledge, which has always struck me as curious. The last paragraph of his seventh book is this:⁠—“The ruler (or god <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span>) of the southern ocean was <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shu</span> (that is, Heedless); the ruler of the northern ocean was <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hu</span> (that is, Hasty); and the ruler of the centre was <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hun-tun</span> (that is, Chaos). <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shu</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hu</span> were continually meeting in the land of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hun-tun</span>, who treated them very well. They consulted together how they might repay his kindness, and said, ‘Men have all seven orifices for the purposes of seeing, hearing, eating, and breathing while this (poor) ruler along has not one. Let us try and make them for him.’ Accordingly they dug one orifice in him every day; and at the end of seven days Chaos died.”</p>
			<p>So it was that Chaos passed away before light. So did the nameless simplicity of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> disappear before knowledge. But it was better that the Chaos should give place to the cosmos. “Heedless” and “Hasty” did a good deed.</p>
			<p>I have thus set forth eight characteristics of the Taoistic system, having respect mostly to what is peculiar and mystical in it. I will not conclude my exhibition of it by bringing together under one head the practical lessons of its author for men individually, and for the administration of government. The praise of whatever excellence these possess belongs to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> himself: <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> devotes himself mainly to the illustration of the abstruse and difficult points.</p>
			<p>First, it does not surprise us that in his rules for individual man, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> should place humility in the foremost place. A favourite illustration with him of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> is water. In his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-8">eighth chapter</a> he says:⁠—“The highest excellence is like that of water. The excellence of water appears in its benefiting all things, and in its occupying, without striving to the contrary, the low ground which all men dislike. Hence (its way) is near to that of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>.” To the same effect in the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-78">seventy-eighth chapter</a>:⁠—“There is nothing in the world more soft and weak than water, and yet for attacking things that are firm and strong there is nothing that can take precedence of it. Every one in the world knows that the soft overcomes the hard, and the weak the strong; but no one is able to carry it out in practice.”</p>
			<p>In his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-67">sixty-seventh chapter</a> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> associates with humility two other virtues, and calls them his three Precious Things, or Jewels. They are gentleness, economy, and shrinking from taking precedence of others. “With that gentleness,” he says, “I can be bold; with that economy I can be liberal; shrinking from taking precedence of others, I can become a vessel of the highest honour.”</p>
			<p>And in his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-63">sixty-third chapter</a>, he rise to a still loftier height of morality. He says, “(It is the way of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>) to act without (thinking of) acting, to conduct affairs without (feeling) the trouble of them; to taste without discerning any flavour, to consider the small as great, and the few as many, and to recompense injury with kindness.”</p>
			<p>Here is the grand Christian precept, “Render to no man evil for evil. If thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink. Be not overcome with evil, but overcome evil with good.” We know that the maxim made some noise in its author’s lifetime; that the disciples of Confucius consulted him about it, and that he was unable to received it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a> It comes in with less important matters by virtue of the Taoistic “rule of contraries.” I have been surprised to find what little reference to it I have met with in the course of my Chinese reading. I do not think that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> takes notice of it to illustrate it after his fashion. There, however, it is in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>. The fruit of it has yet to be developed.</p>
			<p>Second, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> laid down the same rule for the policy of the state as for the life of the individual. He says in his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-61">sixty-first chapter</a>, “What makes a state great is its being like a low-lying, down-flowing stream;⁠—it becomes the centre to which tend all (the small states) under heaven.” He then uses an illustration which will produce a smile:⁠—“Take the case of all females. The female always overcomes the male by her stillness. Stillness may be considered (a sort of) abasement.” Resuming his subject, he adds, “Thus it is that a great state, by condescending to small states, gains them for itself; and that small states, by abasing themselves to a great state, win it over to them. In the one case the abasement tends to gaining adherents; in the other case, to procuring favour. The great state only wishes to unite men together and nourish them; a small state only wishes to be received by, and to serves, the other. Each gets what it desires, but the great state must learn to abase itself.”</p>
			<p>“All very well in theory,” someone will exclaim, “but, the world has not seen it yet reduced to practice.” So it is. The fact is deplorable. No one saw the misery arising from it, and exposed its unreasonableness more unsparingly, than <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>. But it was all in vain in his time, as it has been in all the centuries that have since rolled their course. Philosophy, philanthropy, and religion have still to toil on, “faint, yet pursuing,” believing that in the time will yet come when humility and love shall secure the reign of peace and good will among the nations of men.</p>
			<p>While enjoining humility, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> protested against war. In his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-31">thirty-first chapter</a> he says, “Arms, however beautiful, are instruments of evil omen; hateful, it may be said, to all creatures. They who have the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> do not like to employ them.” Perhaps in his <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-69">sixty-ninth chapter</a> he allows defensive war, but he adds, “There is no calamity greater than that of lightly engaging in war. To do that is near losing the gentleness which is so precious. Thus it is that when weapons are (actually) crossed, he who deplores the (situation) conquers.”</p>
			<p>There are some other points in the practical lessons of Taoism to which I should like to call the attention of the reader, but I must refer him for them to the chapters of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>, and the books of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>. Its salient features have been set forth somewhat fully. Notwithstanding the scorn poured so freely on Confucius by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> and other Taoist writers, he proved in the course of time too strong for <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> as the teacher of their people. The entrance of Buddhism, moreover, into the country in our first century, was very injurious to Taoism, which still exists, but is only the shadow of its former self. It is tolerated by the government, but not patronised as it was when emperors and empresses seemed to think more of it than of Confucianism. It is by the spread of knowledge, which it had always opposed, that its overthrow and disappearance will be brought about ere long.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Accounts of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-Tzŭ</span> Given by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-Ma Chʽien</span></h2>
			<p>It seems desirable, before passing from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> in this “<span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Introduction</span>,” to give a place in it to what is said about them by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span>. I have said that not a single proper name occurs in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>. There is hardly an historical allusion in it. Only one chapter, the <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-20">twentieth</a>, has somewhat of an autobiographical character. It tells us, however, of no incidents of his life. He appears alone in the world through his cultivation of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span>, melancholy and misunderstood, yet binding that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> more closely to his bosom.</p>
			<p>The books of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chunag-tzŭ</span> are of a different nature, abounding in pictures of Taoist life, in anecdotes and narratives, graphic, argumentative, often satirical. But they are not historical. Confucius and many of his disciples, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> and members of his school, heroes and sages of antiquity, and men of his own day, move across his pages; but the incidents in connection with which they are introduced are probably fictitious, and devised by him “to point his moral or adorn his tale.” His names of individuals and places are often like those of Bunyan in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Pilgrim’s Progress</i> or his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Holy War</i>, emblematic of their characters and the doctrines which he employs them to illustrate. He often comes on the stage himself, and there is an air of verisimilitude in his descriptions, possibly also a certain amount of fact about them; but we cannot appeal to them as historical testimony. It is only to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssŭ-ma Chʽien</span> that we can go for this; he always writes in the spirit of a historian; but what he has to tell us of the two men is not much.</p>
			<p>And first, as to his account of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>. When he wrote, about the beginning of the first century <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>, the Taoist master was already known as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span>, however, tells us that his surname was <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li</span>, and his name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Êrh</span>, meaning “Ear,” which gave place after his death to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tan</span>, meaning “Long-eared,” form which we may conclude that he was named from some peculiarity in the form of his ears. He was a native of the state of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽu</span>, which had then extended far beyond its original limits, and his birthplace was in the present province of Henan or of Anhui. He was a curator in the Royal Library; and when Confucius visited the capital in the year <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr> 517, the two men met. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> says that Confucius’s visit to Luoyang was that he might question <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span> on the subject of ceremonies. He might have other objects in mind as well; but however that was, the two met. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li</span> said to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽung</span>, “The men about whom you talk are dead, and their bones are mouldered to dust; only their words are left. Moreover, when the superior man gets his opportunity, he mounts aloft; but when the time is against him, he is carried along by the force of circumstances.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a> I have heard that a good merchant, though he have rich treasures safely stored, appears as if he were poor; and that the superior man, though his virtue be complete, is yet to outward seeming stupid. Put away your proud air and many desires, your insinuating habit and wild will. They are of no advantage to you;⁠—this is all I have to tell you.” Confucius is made to say to his disciples after the interview: “I know how birds can fly, fishes can swim, and animals run. But the runner may be snared, the swimmer hooked, and the flyer shot by the arrow. But there is the dragon:⁠—I cannot tell how he mounts on the wind through the clouds, and rises to heaven. Today I have seen <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, and can only compare him to the dragon.”</p>
			<p>In this speech of Confucius we have, I believe, the origin of the name <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, as applied to the master of Taoism. Its meaning is “The Old Philosopher,” or “The Old Gentleman.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a> Confucius might well so style <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li Êrh</span>. At the time of this interview he was himself in his thirty-fifth year, and the other was in his eighty-eighth. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> adds, “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> cultivated the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and its attributes, the chief aim of his studies being how to keep himself concealed and remain unknown. He continued to reside at (the capital of) <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, but after a long time, seeing the decay of the dynasty, he left it and went away to the barrier-gate, leading out of the kingdom on the northwest. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yin Hsi</span>, the warden of the gate, said to him, ‘You are about to withdraw yourself out of sight. Let me insist on your (first) composing for me a book.’ On this, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> wrote a book in two parts, setting forth his views on the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao</span> and its attributes, in more than 5000 characters. He then went away, and it is not known where he died. He was a superior man, who liked to keep himself unknown.”</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> finally traces <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> descendants down to the first century <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>, and concludes by saying, “Those who attach themselves to the doctrine of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> condemn that of the literati, and the literati on their part condemn <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, verifying the saying, ‘Parties whose principles are different cannot take counsel together.’ <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li Êrh</span> taught that by doing nothing others are as a matter of course transformed, and that rectification in the same way ensues from being pure and still.”</p>
			<p>This morsel is all that we have of historical narrative about <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>. The account of writing of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> at the request of the warden of the barrier-gate has a doubtful and legendary appearance. Otherwise, the record is free from anything to raise suspicion about it. It says nothing about previous existences of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>, and nothing of his travelling to the west, and learning there the doctrines which are embodied in his work. He goes through the pass out of the domain of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span>, and died no one knowing where.</p>
			<p>It is difficult, however, to reconcile this last statement with a narrative in the end of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ’s</span> third book. There we see <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> dead, and a crowd of mourners wailing round the corpse, and giving extraordinary demonstration of grief, which offend a disciple of a higher order, who has gone to the house to offer his condolences on the occasion. But for the peculiar nature of most of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ’s</span> narratives, we should say, in opposition to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span>, that the place and time of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> death were well known. Possibly, however, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> may have invented the whole story, to give him the opportunity of setting forth what, according to his ideal of it, the life of a Taoist master should be, and how even <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> himself fall short of it.</p>
			<p>Second, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien’s</span> account of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> is still more brief. He was a native, he tells us, of the territory of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng</span>, which belonged to the kingdom of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liang</span> or <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</span>, and held an office, he does not say what, in the city of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi-yüan</span>. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> was thus of the same part of China as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, and probably grew up familiar with all his speculations and lessons. He lived during the reigns of kings <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hui</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Liang</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsüan</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽu</span>. We cannot be wrong therefore in assigning his period to the latter half of the third, and earlier part of the fourth century <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>. He was thus a contemporary of Mencius. They visited at the same courts, and yet neither ever mentions the other. They were the two ablest debaters of their day, and fond of exposing what they deemed heresy. But it would only be a matter of useless speculation to try to account for their never having come into argumentative collision.</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> says: “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> had made himself well acquainted with all the literature of his time, but preferred the views of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, and ranked himself among his followers, so that of the more than ten myriads of characters contained in his published writings the greater part are occupied with metaphorical illustrations of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> doctrines. He made ‘the old fisherman,’ ‘the robber of <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">chih</i>,’ and ‘the cutting open satchels,’ to satirize and expose the disciples of Confucius, and clearly exhibit the sentiments of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao</span>. Such names and characters as ‘<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei-lei Hsü</span>’ and ‘<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽang-sang Tzŭ</span>’ are fictitious, and the pieces where they occur are not to be understood as narratives of real events.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a></p>
			<p>“But <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang</span> was an admirable writer and skilful composer, and by his instances and truthful descriptions hit and exposed the Mohists and literati. The ablest scholars of his day could not escape his satire nor reply to it, while he allowed and enjoyed himself with his sparkling, dashing style; and thus it was that the greatest men, even kings and princes, could not use him for their purposes.</p>
			<p>“King <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</span> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽu</span>, having heard of the ability of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-chou</span>, sent messengers with large gifts to bring him to his court, and promising also that he would make him his chief minister. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, however, only laughed and said to them, ‘A thousand ounces of silver are a great gain to me, and to be a high noble and minister is most honourable position. But have you not seen the victim-ox for the border sacrifice? It is carefully fed for several years, and robed with rich embroidery that it may be fit to enter the Grand Temple. When the time comes for it to do so, it would prefer to be a little pig, but it cannot get to be so. Go away quickly, and do not soil me with your presence. I had rather amuse and enjoy myself in the midst of a filthy ditch than be subject to the rules and restrictions in the court of a sovereign. I have determined never to take office, but prefer the enjoyment of my own free will.’ ”</p>
			<p><span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien</span> concludes his account of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> with the above story, condensed by him, probably, from two of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang’s</span> own narratives, in <abbr>par.</abbr> 11 of <abbr>bk.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVII</span>, and 13 of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXII</span>, to the injury of them both. Paragraph 14 of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXII</span> brings before us one of the last scenes of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chung-tzŭ’s</span> life, and we may doubt whether it should be received as from his own pencil. It is interesting in itself, however, and I introduce it here: “When <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> was about to die, his disciples signified their wish to give him a grand burial. ‘I shall have heaven and earth,’ he said, ‘for my coffin and its shell; the sun and moon for my two round symbols of jade; the stars and constellations for my pearls and jewels;⁠—will not the provisions for my interment be complete? What would you add to them?’ The disciples replied, ‘We are afraid that the crows and kites will eat our master.’ <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> rejoined, ‘Above, the crows and kites will eat me; below, the mole-crickets and ants will eat me; to take from those and give to these would only show your partiality.’ ”</p>
			<p>Such were among the last words of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>. His end was not so impressive as that of Confucius; but it was in keeping with the general magniloquence and strong assertion of independence that marked all his course.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface by James Legge</h2>
			<p>In the “Preface” to the third volume of these <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sacred Books of the East</i> (1879), I stated that I proposed giving in due course, in order to exhibit the System of Taoism, translations of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> (sixth century <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Writings of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span></i> (between the middle of the fourth and third centuries <abbr epub:type="se:era">BC</abbr>), and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Treatise of “Actions and Their Retributions”</i> (of our eleventh century); and perhaps also of one or more of the other characteristic Productions of the System.</p>
			<p>The two volumes now submitted to the reader are a fulfilment of the promise made so long ago. They contain versions of the three works which were specified, and, in addition, as appendixes, four other shorter treatises of Taoism; analyses of several of the books of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lin Hsi-chung</span>; a list of the stories which form so important a part of those books; two essays by two of the greatest Scholars of China, written the one in <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 586 and illustrating the Taoistic beliefs of that age, and the other in <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1078 and dealing with the four books of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>, whose genuineness is frequently called in question. The concluding index is confined very much to proper names. For subjects the reader is referred to the tables of contents, the introduction to the books of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> (<abbr>vol.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xxxix</span> <abbr>pp.</abbr> 127⁠–⁠163), and the introductory notes to the various appendixes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></p>
			<p>The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Treatise of Actions and Their Retributions</i> exhibits to us the Taoism of the eleventh century in its moral or ethical aspects; in the two earlier works we see it rather as a philosophical speculation than as a religion in the ordinary sense of that term. It was not till after the introduction of Buddhism into China in our first century that Taoism began to organise itself as a religion, having its monasteries and nunneries, its images and rituals. While it did so, it maintained the superstitions peculiar to itself:⁠—some, like the cultivation of the Tao as a rule of life favourable to longevity, come down from the earliest times, and others which grew up during the decay of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chou</span> dynasty, and subsequently blossomed;⁠—now in mystical speculation; now in the pursuits of alchemy; now in the search for the pills of immortality and the elixir vitae; now in astrological fancies; now in visions of spirits and in magical arts to control them; and finally in the terrors of its purgatory and everlasting hell. Its phases have been continually changing, and at present it attracts our notice more as a degraded adjunct of Buddhism than as a development of the speculations of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span>. Up to its contact with Buddhism, it subsisted as an opposition to the Confucian system, which, while admitting the existence and rule of the Supreme Being, bases its teaching on the study of man’s nature and the enforcement of the duties binding on all men from the moral and social principles of their constitution.</p>
			<p>It is only during the present century that the Texts of Taoism have begun to receive the attention which they deserve. Christianity was introduced into China by Nestorian missionaries in the seventh century; and from the Xi’an Monument, which was erected by their successors in 781, nearly 150 years after their first entrance, we perceive that they were as familiar with the books of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chuang-tzŭ</span> as with the Confucian literature of the empire, but that monument is the only memorial of them that remains. In the thirteenth century the Roman Catholic Church sent its earliest missionaries to China, but we hardly know anything of their literary labours.</p>
			<p>The great Romish mission which continue to the present day began towards the end of the sixteenth century; and there exists now in the India Office a translation of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> in Latin, which was brought to English by a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Matthew Raper, and presented by him to the Royal Society, of which he was a Fellow, on January 10th, 1788. The manuscript is in excellent preservation, but we do not know by whom the version was made. It was presented, as stated in the <a href="translators-intro-3.xhtml#translators-intro-3-p-1"><span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">“Introduction,”</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 1</a>, to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Raper by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P.</abbr> de Grammont, <span xml:lang="la">Missionarius Apostolicus, ex-Jesuita</span>. The chief object of the translator or translators was to show that “the Mysteries of the Most Holy Trinity and of the Incarnate God were anciently known to the Chinese nation.” The version as a whole is of little value. The reader will find, in <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-108-p-5">endnote 108</a>, its explanation of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> <a href="tao-te-ching.xhtml#chapter-72">seventy-second chapter</a>;⁠—the first morsel of it that has appeared in print.</p>
			<p>Protestant missions to China commenced in 1807; but it was not till 1868 that the <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Chalmers, a member of one of them, published his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Speculations on Metaphysics, Polity, and Morality of “The Old Philosopher,” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span></i>. Meanwhile, <span xml:lang="fr">Abel-Rémusat</span> had aroused the curiosity of scholars throughout Europe, in 1823, by his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Memoir on the Life and Opinions of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, a Chinese Philosopher of the sixth century before our era, who professed the opinions commonly attributed to Pythagoras, to Plato, and to their disciples</i>. <span xml:lang="fr">Rémusat</span> was followed by one who had received from him his first lessons in Chinese, and had become a truly great Chinese scholar⁠—the late <span xml:lang="fr">Stanislas Julien</span>. He published in 1842 “a complete translation for the first time of this memorable work, which is regarded with reason as the most profound, the most abstract, and the most difficult of all Chinese literature.” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Chalmers’s translation was also complete, but his comments, whether original or from Chinese sources, were much fewer than those supplied by <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span>. Two years later, two German versions of the treatise were published at Leipzig;⁠—by Reinhold von <span xml:lang="de">Plänckner</span> and Victor von Strauss, differing much from each other, but both marked by originality and ability.</p>
			<p>I undertook myself, as stated above, in 1879 to translate for <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Sacred Books of the East</i> the texts of Taoism which appear in these volumes; and, as I could find time from my labours on <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Texts of Confucianism</i>, I had written out more than one version of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> work by the end of 1880. Though not satisfied with the result, I felt justified in exhibiting my general views of it in an article in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">British Quarterly Review</i> of July, 1883.</p>
			<p>In 1884 <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Balfour published at Shanghai a version of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Taoist Texts, Ethical, Political, and Speculative</i>. His Texts were ten in all, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> being the first and longest of them. His version of this differed in many points from all previous versions; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Giles, of <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.M.</abbr>’s Consular Service in China, vehemently assailed it and also <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Chalmers’s translation, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">China Review</i> for March and April, 1886. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles, indeed, occasionally launched a shaft also at <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span> and myself; but his main object in his article was to discredit the genuineness and authenticity of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> itself. “The work,” he says, “is undoubtedly a forgery. It contains, indeed, much that <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> did say, but more that he did not.” I replied, so far as was necessary, to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles in the same <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Review</i> for January and February, 1888; and a brief summary of my reply is given in the <a href="translators-intro-2.xhtml#translators-intro-2-p-1">second chapter of the <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">“Introduction”</span></a> in this volume. My confidence has never been shaken for a moment in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i> as genuine relic of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, one of the most original minds of the Chinese race.</p>
			<p>In preparing the version now published, I have used:⁠—</p>
			<p>First, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Complete Works of the Ten Philosophers</i>;⁠—a Suzhou reprint in 1804 of the best editions of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Philosophers</i>, nearly all belonging more or less to the Taoist school, included in it. It is a fine specimen of Chinese printing, clear and accurate. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Treatise</i> of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> of course occupies the first place, as edited by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuei Yu-kuang</span> (better known as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kuei Chên-chʽuan</span>) of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ming</span> dynasty. The text and commentary are those of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho-shang Kung</span> (<a href="translators-intro-2.xhtml#translators-intro-2-p-7"><abbr>Introd.</abbr>, <abbr>par.</abbr> 7</a>), along with the division of the whole into parts and eighty-one chapters, and the titles of the several chapters, all attributed to him. Along the top of the page, there is a large collection of notes from celebrated commentators and writers down to the editor himself.</p>
			<p>Second, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Text and Commentary of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Pi</span></i> (called also <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Fu-ssŭ</span>), who died <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 249, at the early age of twenty-four. See <a href="translators-intro-2.xhtml#translators-intro-2-p-8"><span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">“Introduction,”</span> <abbr>par.</abbr> 8</a>.</p>
			<p>Third, <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><i>Helps</i> (<abbr>lit.</abbr> Wings) <i>to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span></i></span>; by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chiao Hung</span> (called also <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Jo-hou</span>), and prefaced by him in 1587. This is what <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span> calls “the most extensive and most important contribution to the understanding of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, which we yet possess.” Its contents are selected from the ablest writings on the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Treatise</i> from <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Fei</span> (<a href="translators-intro-2.xhtml#translators-intro-2-p-3"><abbr>Introd.</abbr>, <abbr>par.</abbr> 3</a>) downwards, closing in many chapters with the notes made by the compiler himself in the course of his studies. Altogether the book sets before us the substance of the views of sixty-four writers on our short <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching</i>. <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span> took the trouble to analyse the list of them, and found it composed of three emperors, twenty professed Taoists, seven Buddhists, and thirty-four Confucianists or members of the literati. He says, “These last constantly explain <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span> according to the ideas peculiar to the school of Confucius, at the risk of misrepresenting him, and with the express intention of throttling his system;” then adding, “The commentaries written in such a spirit have no interest for persons who wish to enter fully into the thought of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>, and obtain a just idea of his doctrine. I have thought it useless, therefore, to specify the names of such commentaries and their authors.”</p>
			<p>I have quoted these sentences of <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span>, because of a charge brought by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour, in a prefatory note to his own version of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>, against him and other translators. “One prime defect,” he says, though with some hesitation, “lies at the root of every translation that has been published hitherto; and this is, that not one seems to have been based solely and entirely on commentaries furnished by members of the Taoist school. The Confucian element enters largely into all; and here, I think, an injustice has been done to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-pinyin">Laozi</span>. To a Confucianist the Taoist system is in every sense of the word a heresy, and a commentator holding his opinion is surely not the best expositor. It is as a grammarian rather than as a philosopher that a member of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ju Chia</span> deals with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>; he gives the sense of a passage according to the syntactical construction rather than according to the genius of the philosophy itself; and in attempting to explain the text by his own canons, instead of by the canons of Taoism, he mistakes the superficial and apparently obvious meaning for the hidden and esoteric interpretation.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour will hardly repeat his charge of imperfect or erroneous interpretation against <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span>; and I believe that is equally undeserved by most, if not all, of the other translators against whom it is directed. He himself adopted as his guide the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Explanations of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</span></i>, current as the work of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Yen</span> (called also <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Tsu</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Tung-pin</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Chʽung-yang</span>), a Taoist of the eighth century. Through <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour’s kindness I have had an opportunity of examining this edition of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lao’s</span> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Treatise</i>; and I am compelled to agree with the very unfavourable judgement on it pronounced by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Giles as both “spurious” and “ridiculous.” All that we are told of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Yen</span> is very suspicious; much of it evidently false. The editions of our little book ascribed to him are many. I have for more than twenty years possessed one with the title of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Meaning of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</span> Explained by the <strong>True</strong> Man of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽung-yang</span></i>, being a reprint of 1690, and as different as possible from the work patronised by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour.</p>
			<p>Fourth, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽai Shang Hsüan Yüan Tao Te Ching</i>⁠—a work of the present dynasty, published at Shanghai, but when produced I do not know. It is certainly of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Tsu</span> type, and is worth purchasing as one of the finest specimens of block-printing. It professes to be the production of “The Immortals of the Eight Grottoes,” each of whom is styled “a Divine Ruler (<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti Chün</span>).” The eighty-one chapters are equally divided for commentary among them, excepting that “the Divine Ruler, the Universal Refiner,” has the last eleven assigned to him. The text is everywhere broken up into short clauses, which are explained in a very few characters by “God, the True Helper,” the same, I suppose, who is also styled, “The Divine Ruler, the True Helper,” and comments at length on chapters 31 to 40. I mention these particulars as an illustration of how the ancient Taoism has become polytheistic and absurd. The name “God, the True Helper,” is a title, I imagine, given to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lü Tsu</span>. With all this nonsense, the composite commentary is a good one, the work, evidently, of one hand. One of the several recommendatory preface is ascribed to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wên Chʽang</span>, the god of literature; and he specially praises the work, as “explaining the meaning by examination of the text.”</p>
			<p>Fifth, a <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Collection of the Most Important Treatises of the Taoist Fathers</i> (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Tsu Chên Chʽuan Chi Yao</i>). This was reprinted in 1877 at Changzhou in Jiangsu; beginning with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</i>, and ending with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kan Ying Pʽien</i>. Between these there are fourteen other treatises, mostly short, five of them being among <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Balfour’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Taoist Texts</i>. The collection was edited by a <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lu Yü</span>; and the commentary selected by him, in all but the last treatise, was by a <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li Hsi-yüeh</span>, who appears to have been a recluse in a monastery on a mountain in the department of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pao-ning</span>, Sichuan, if, indeed, what is said of him be not entirely fabulous.</p>
			<p>Sixth, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Commentary on the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tao Te Ching</span></i>, by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span> (<abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1249⁠–⁠1333) of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Lin Chʽuan</span>. This has been of the highest service to me. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span> was the greatest of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yüan</span> scholars. He is one of the literati quoted from occasionally by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chiao Hung</span> in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Wings</i>; but by no means so extensively as <span xml:lang="fr">Julien</span> supposes (<span epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">“Observations Détachées”</span> <abbr>p.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">xli</span>). My own copy of his work is in the 12th section of the large <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Collection of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yüeh-ya</span> Hall</i>, published in 1853. Writing of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu Chʽêng</span> in 1865 (“<abbr>Proleg.</abbr>” to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shu</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 36), I said that he was “a bold thinker and a daring critic, handling his text with a freedom which I had not seen in any other Chinese scholar.” The subsequent study of his writings has confirmed me in this opinion of him. Perhaps he might be characterised as an independent, rather than as a bold, thinking, and the daring of his criticism must not be supposed to be without caution. (See <a href="translators-intro-2.xhtml#translators-intro-2-p-11">“<abbr>Introd.,</abbr>” <abbr>p. 9</abbr></a>.)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></p>
			<p>I have thus set forth all that is necessary to be said here by way of preface. For various information about the treatises comprised in the appendixes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> the reader is referred to the preliminary notes, which preceded the translation of most of them. I have often sorely missed the presence of a competent native scholar who would have assisted me in the quest of references, and in talking over difficult passages. Such a helper would have saved me much time; but the result, I think, would scarcely have appeared in any great alteration of my versions.</p>
