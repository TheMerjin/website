				<p>
					<span>Lo, all the passionate pale evening</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lay between the breasts of my beloved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the lilies, in the lily garden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sky was pale, and all the sunset faded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the stars I saw not in the heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the glory of her face above me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw alone, wrapt in a dream of slumber;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo, she was more fair than all the lilies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the lilies, in the lily garden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her hair was golden chains to bind me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all her mouth was crimson fire to burn me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the world became as wind before me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as the wind before her face that passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the lilies, in the lily garden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo, her face was fairer than the stars are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo, her breasts were whiter than the moon is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whiter than the moon, and tipp’d with crimson coral.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And low she bow’d her body, low before me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave me of her joy unto fulfilling:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She bow’d her head whereto the stars do homage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before whose face the years wax dim and fading,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before whose eyes the ages pass and vanish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bow’d her low down before me like a lily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the lilies, in the lily garden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now at last I care not if the morning</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come at all, or the pale stars have setting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay I care not if the whole world perish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perish and die, or if the white stars falter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay I care not if the night forever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hold me by her, and all things have ceasing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, because her lips are more than roses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, because her breasts are more than Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yea, because her face is more than God is,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>All things, at the hour of parting,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Listen, how sweet the ocean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto our spirits calleth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Softly the starlight falleth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the dreaming sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fadeth the land, beloved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That long hath our spirits tired,</span>

					<span>Before us lies that desired</span>

					<span>Far country, strange and new;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Far off lies that dream’d-of country</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternally fair and blessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternally undistressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far over the ocean blue.</span>
				</p>
				<p>

					<span>Year-long with gentle motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the unending ocean</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Batheth the tropic shore;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There never storms blow loudly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There never wet rain falleth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There never loud wind calleth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor stormy waters roar.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fairer the stars that lighten</span>

					<span>There, than to us is given,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There in a fairer heaven</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There through the long long hours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wandering breezes swoon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There in that land, beloved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is never a sound of living,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never is heard thanksgiving</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, nor the noise of moan;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There naught is heard of sorrow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing is there begotten;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, with all life forgotten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We two shall come alone.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There, O my one beloved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through twilight never-closing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We two shall sit reposing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever, thou with me;</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There ’neath the stars eternal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We two shall sit, we only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While from the heavens, lonely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moon sinks in the sea.</span>

					<span>Far in the melancholy hills it stands,</span>

					<span class="i1">Far off; and through the vista of the years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down which my soul its helpless journey steers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It flames a fire to lighten all the lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A fire that burns me and a flame that brands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me, whose dead days pass slow as heavy tears.</span>
				</p>

					<span class="i1">And the low way mine eyes can scarcely see;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Like the sky’s fire my weary pathway fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seems a place of life to be.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The world is but a background for it there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where it stands, loud like a beaten lyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flames blood-red like some vast funeral-pyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat my heart to fail doth not forbear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of all the things that have been made soe’er</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only the House remains, a quenchless fire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah God, that this thing were not in the world⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hateful House that flames with light and song</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weary singing all the ages long;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah that ev’n this might in the dust be hurl’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And crush’d and slain, even as my heart, where curl’d</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The kindly armies of the worm do throng.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yea, surely I have seen it long ago,</span>

					<span class="i1">Far sunken in the weary dust of time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yea surely even that stair so hard to climb</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I climb’d, and strode its hallways to and fro;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which were bright with many lamps aglow,</span>

				<p>
					<span>I am become a housing for the toad;</span>

					<span class="i1">There is no joy here, and there is no light;</span>

					<span>O God, O God, I have reap’d what I sow’d;</span>

						<span>And since I understood not what so strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Driveth all these at such exstatic pace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I too went down and joined in the throng;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many sitting in a lowly place</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I saw, where sense and vision darkness clogs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With one flat-breasted wife with munched face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bestial litter as of rats or hogs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">These are all they that eat and multiply</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In the same manner with low apes and dogs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like these they live and like these they shall die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—Pass thou from these, said then to me that voice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And heed not thou the stinking of that sty.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then saw I them that did with wine rejoice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Crowning their heads with roses of the earth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I too sat down and joined in that noise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ask’d me soon⁠—Why do all these have mirth?</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">From these I past, weary of myrrh and wine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Others apart whose spirits had more dearth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat solitary as who would fain divine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of seeing and of hearing ill content;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With these I sat, half drunken with the vine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sick of visions that aye came and went;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">But all the knowledge that their striving found</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Was but one vision more than wine had sent;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All these also shall moulder in the ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">From these I past as from dead flesh and bones.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then came I where the kings of earth sat crown’d</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neath purple canopies on golden thrones;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">These offer’d me part in that changeless state,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Until my soul wearied of brass and brônze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Others whose sweating nothing could abate</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Kingdoms and cities build and overthrow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Till my soul wonder’d at the striving great</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the puppets in that puppet-show:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—Doth the string move them with such urgency,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That all their limbs such strange grimaces show?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>—These are all they that do, one made reply;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In all their actions never could I find</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">What they were doing these things for nor why.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From these I past as from the deaf and blind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And ever as I went the solemn brawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of all these mad and idiot howl’d behind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I came to those that ceased not to call.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The world unto them, shouting o’er and o’er;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">My heart knew not why these so loudly bawl;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some stood round with faces that implore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Asking for peace; and ever those that gave</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Did but like these delude themselves the more;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rottenness shall stop all these that rave.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Last, some there were that did with vanity</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Toil ever with unwearied hands to save</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to eternize all things great and high;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With these I stay’d, till my heart questioned:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—What are the things thou doëst here and why?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat all these became as persons dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then I arose from among these the last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And follow’d then where’er my footsteps led;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And among them that reigned then I past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And among them that ever fain would know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And among them whose lot with wine was cast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I past the prophets and the puppet-show,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And among them that joy’d in marble and in song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And all that Seven tir’d of long ago.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And is this all the meaning of that throng,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">This all, O heart, that wast of seeing fain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">But like a circle that still seemeth long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because it goeth round and round again?</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Not in all these doth any reason hide</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">No more than in the words of the insane.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is no ground for sorrow; nor in pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">For pride; nor in them that in gladness sate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Wherefore with none of these shall I abide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sought is vanity; the seeking great</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Vanity; the not-seeking vanity;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">For none of these change I my solemn state.</span>

						<span>Then since no one could answer unto me</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The question, and since no one could me tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The wherefore of this endless Vanity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the spirits that on earth did dwell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I said⁠—I go unto the Absolute;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He will perchance release me from this hell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Him that made noisy what before was mute</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I found upon a heap of filthy dung</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Low-sitting in the fashion of the brute.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In strange grimaces still his face he wrung,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Up to the chin within that filth immerst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Which still his busy hands about him flung.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>—Do thou those clothes wherein he is inhearst</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Take off, said I to one, and do not shirk.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He did, while still that being howl’d and curst.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there so thick and muddy was the murk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And he still bore of clothes so thick a weight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I knew not well what thing therein did lurk.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three coverings then that one removed straight⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Omniscience, Omnipresence, Omnipotence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">From off the thing that in the ordure sate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then did his truth show clear to every sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">A filthy idiot so foul and low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That decency the perfect tale prevents.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I⁠—O thou whose nakedness doth show</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Like one not in the womb to fulness brought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Why are all things that are; if thou dost know?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then he replied from out the ordure hot:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—Brahma, great Brahma, Everlasting, I!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And I⁠—Not such reply my question sought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Answer thou me! And he still made reply:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—Brahma, great Brahma! repetition vain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I asked again: and⁠—Brahma! he did cry.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then one thereby to me⁠—Why art thou fain</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">
							<span>Knowledge to have from It?</span>
							<span>It knows not, It;</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Why seek for truth among the low insane?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then he that did within the ordure sit</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Out of the filth that lay about his feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Such things as children make with little wit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made, and then broke, and did the act repeat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—I have made all the worlds, he gibbered;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And I his labour with these words did greet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>—Why dost thou these things? why, O why? I said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">No word vouchsaf’d the mouth of him that stank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">But giggling sounds and idiot uttered.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then seated in that place of ordure rank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With his two lips he made a cackling sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And back within the friendly ordure sank.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then I with a great sad and awful voice</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Cried out⁠—O thou that rottest in this sty,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">O thou whose soul in ordure doth rejoice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What art thou doing these things for and why?</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then one to me⁠—His bliss is not to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The infiniteness of his own Vanity;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therefore the soul of him that stinketh so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Because his sense is blind and deaf and mad</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Forever, knoweth not eternal woe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lo from the first his soul no reason had;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He thinketh he himself is everything,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">
							<span>And nothing is but him!</span>
							<span>He is not sad.</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ignorance, ignorance, shrouds him like a pall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Therefore thus low upon the fetid floor</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He sits, and knoweth naught outside his stall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I⁠—He maketh naught outside his store.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Why doth he this? and in this fetid tomb</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Sitteth he here in madness evermore?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How long shall iron, awful, gnashing doom</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Leave him thus naked old and idiot</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Blind deaf and stinking, in the loathed gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How long shall This within the ordure squat?</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">How long shall This cease not to beck and nod?</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">How long shall This cease not to rot and rot?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he⁠—This rottenness that seemeth God</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">More woe than this nor any other mode</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Shall know not, till It ceaseth in the sod.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as a gnat, a viper, or a toad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Because its nature is not infinite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">It too shall perish in the worm’s abode;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till then It suppurateth in the night.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Then from the world I turn’d my steps afar;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I came there where the holy Trinity</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And all the blessed saints in glory are,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And did the beatific vision see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And how those happy are that once did mourn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">But my heart said⁠—All this is naught to me;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor knew I why all these should be reborn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Where moon-fac’d houris wanton arms do fling</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Round Mahmud’s blessed, I past by in scorn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For my heart dream’d a deeper revelling.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then came I to that banquet more divine</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That Jayadeva and that Jami sing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the fair goblet fill’d full of the wine</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Brought the cup-bearer clad with wantonness;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And there with the beloved and the vine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My heart grew weary of that blessedness.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">From life I past, finding no joy therein.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The vision and the vine and drunkenness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still like a circle ever closing in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then I departed to the final peace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Sick of what is and shall be and hath been,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Brahma, as the drop sinks in the seas:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I past out from the bonds of thee-and-me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Lost in that Infinite whose being is</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glory in all things and reality;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">But therein I that was not I, alas</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In that deliverance from me-and-thee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where all illusion fadeth like to grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Found naught that equall’d my undimm’d desire;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">—If that reality then real was,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What is that real more than trodden mire?</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Then from all being did my spirit pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Sick of all being whether low or higher.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of that circle unto nothingness</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">I came, unto Nirvana, the far goal</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Of many a holy saint, where visions cease;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But nothingness did not my heart console.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Ah not in nothingness is any peace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Nor in peace any peace, nor in the whole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor in the vine nor in the vision, nor</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In being nor non-being, nor in all</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">That man hath dream’d of and hath anguisht for.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nay not in joy nor the vine jovial,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Nor in the perfume of the lov’d one’s breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Nay nor in anything anywhere at all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor in illusion; nor what sundereth</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Illusion; in the sundering of that chain</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">There is no joy; and not alas in death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Find I that thing whereof my soul is fain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">All these things also are all vanity</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now at the last, Zulaikha, all my sorrows olden</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are farther off than Europe or than China seem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And like an idle dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The North is faded far off in the distance golden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here with thee I sit in perfect peace enfolden</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside the Ganges-stream.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Full well I knew that ne’er those northern promontories</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could give to me the dream that did my soul desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there my heart did tire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For always me allur’d the strangely whisper’d stories</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of skies that burn with more consuming languid glories,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suns of mightier fire.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I dream’d of heavier suns than burn in skies of ours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heavier airs that through the long long evening swoon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under a larger moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heavier-scented gardens fill’d with stranger flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tropic palms that wave through all the long long hours</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of endless afternoon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last now from that northern dream am I awoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At last I am come home over the watery main;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long long I sigh’d in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now under tropic palms I lie in peace unbroken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mine own land I see, beloved, and hear spoken</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My natal tongue again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Zulaikha, past is all the longing and endeavour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The palm-trees sleep, and sleeping move not any leaf;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perisht is woe and grief;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stilly the padmas float upon the holy river;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among all these we two with languid eyes forever</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lie sunk in endless kief.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Before us riseth white our marble-builded palace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast let fall from out thy hands that weary are</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The volume of Attár.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy hand hath spill’d the wine within the silver chalice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the river winding through the distant valleys</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleepeth the <span xml:lang="fr">nénufar</span>.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From out the oleanders languid slumber steepeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou, Zulaihka, dost, in rest too deep for dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like one enchanted seem;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy beauty now in waking slumber sunken sleepeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And dreaming past thy wholly closëd eyelids creepeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sleepy-flowing stream.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou hast the light of Asia in thy face divinest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in thy scented mouth and in thy lotus-eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O wine of Paradise!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O moon-fac’d love that by the sacred stream reclinest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hath this world anything for which in vain thou pinest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thing shall be thy prize.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The caravans that in the desert, heavy-laden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By unknown oases pitch their sun-blacken’d tents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shall bring thee all sweet scents</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherein delight in heaven the houris ever-maiden⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Patchouli, nard, and myrrh, from many a distant aden</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of heavenly indolence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All kinds of gems wherefore thine almond eyes have yearning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In heaps, wherein to bathe thy beauties languorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O maiden amorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shall bring home to thee from distant isles returning⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pearl, sapphire, diamond, topaz, and ruby burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And opal luminous.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou art that sweet whereof all poets dead have chaunted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore my soul hath sought thy face o’er pathless seas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here to have endless peace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art the garden of delight with slumber haunted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy perfume maketh dream of desert lands enchaunted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And far-off oases.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou hast that beauty in thine all-consuming glances</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That openeth the ways to far enchanted skies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in thy lotus-eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast the light that shineth in the countenances</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of them whose eyes have seen the glory which entrances</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blest of Paradise.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thou art all sweets that unto perfect joy devote us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In thee all spices and all scents together come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O lute that now art dumb!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art musk, frankincense, amomum, stephanotis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art the fragrant wine, the paradisal lotus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art the opium.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hashsheesh nor opium are worth not thy caresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweeter than opium to still the spirit’s drouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine unassuaged mouth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him that hath known thy love no mortal grief distresses;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweeter thy kisses are than incense which oppresses</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The breezes of the South⁠ ⁠…</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At last I am come home, come home; and all regretting</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is with the North afar from thee and me away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold O love, the day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is past, in Indian skies the holy sun is setting;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mûzin from his tower calleth unforgetting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The faithful ones to pray.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Under the velvet night wide Indiä reposes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now in the scented dark the champak odours swoon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slowly the summer moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Riseth into the azure night made drunk with roses;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo the camel-bells, now that the daylight closes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tinkle their quiet tune.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Behold, O well-beloved, ’neath the moonlight gleaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The travellers depart from out the sleeping khan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O perfume Asiän!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And past the moonlit palace, where we two lie dreaming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With camels and with horsemen like to shadows seeming</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Departs the caravan.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It is the starting hour, O most melancholy!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In long procession underneath the moon’s pale gleams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like something that but seems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The caravan departeth to the desert slowly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There far afar to seek through endless time the holy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mirages of their dreams.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Prelude</h2>
			<p>
				<span>I am a little tired of all things mortal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see through half-shut eyelids languorous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The old monotonous</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold sun set slowly through the western portal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where I recline upon my deep dîwân,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Ispahân.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I am a little weary of the Persian</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Girl that I lov’d; I am quite tir’d of love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I am weary of</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The smoking censers, and the sweet diversion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of stroking Leila’s jasmine-scented hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I thought so fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last I think I am quite tired of beauty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why do the stars shine always in the sky?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think if I might die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something more sweet, less tiring than the duty</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of kissing her, might be; I am tired of myrrh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And kissing her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Khaled, come, come, and slowly move the scented</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gold narghilé away; let the lyres cease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now a little peace!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For see, moon-faced Leila hath repented</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of singing Hafiz’ songs melodiously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And languidly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Surely all things are vain, and great thanksgiving</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is due not; surely all things now are vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all my heart is fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of something, something, far too great for living;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing is very sad, nor wonderful,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor beautiful.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well now, since all things are not worth the winning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Goodbye! With these I have a little play’d;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And once, alas, I pray’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That gorgeous, golden sins be mine for sinning;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now I would not leave my palanquin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For any sin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And long ago I prov’d in great compassion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For man, that Brahm is not nor ever was;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now, alas, alas</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would he were, that in the olden fashion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I might laugh once again ere all is said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But Brahm is dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then with philosophy I bor’d me duly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since I could not slumber all the time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I, in sweet golden rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On white papyrus scented with patchouli</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wrote masterpieces starry-beautiful.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The earth was full.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So beauty wearied me; in order slowly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Love, Joy, and Victory came unto me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I kiss’d them languidly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Virtue came, and Duty, stiff and holy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these I said⁠—Pray come another day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turn’d away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now since of all I am a little weary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since on earth I must a while sojourn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And since a while must burn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The censer of my long existence dreary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All things shall walk, that own my mastery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In luxury.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My Ennui shall in vestments falling lowly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stiff, purple, trailing, long, episcopal</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweep through her palace hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Like to a consecrated bishop holy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My Sin from golden goblets of Byzant</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall drink absinthe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And my gold-crowned wanton goddess Pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>(My candles are all burning at her shrine)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall be made drunk with wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And walk unto the velvet-falling measure</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of golden-voiced, solemn-sounding shawms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No rhyme for shawms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All they that wait upon me in my glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My purple Pride, and my Luxuriousness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my Voluptuousness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall show within their faces transitory</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something more subtile than all life can give,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While I shall live⁠ ⁠…</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, all is liv’d, all eaten, all is drunken!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Soul, is there anything now left for thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Excepting sanctity?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nay, ev’n we too have been in virtue sunken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have been holy priest, we have confess’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Said, <i xml:lang="la">Missa Est</i>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have drunk out of heavy goblets golden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As from some hellish <span xml:lang="la">tabernaculum</span></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cannabis, conium;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know quite all the poisons, all the olden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sins, all the <span xml:lang="fr">ténébreux</span> dark secrets hid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And things forbid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have had all things unto mortals given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I all the women, all the passion I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the satiety;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have had all the pleasures known in heaven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Paradisiacal, purpureal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Exstatical.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With all the sciences I am acquainted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! I know quite all the languages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the philosophies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alas! and all the pictures that are painted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the palac’d capitals that be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have wearied me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas, all art, all knowledge, and all passion</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have had: I have heard all the symphonies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have sail’d all the seas;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I have drain’d all life’s cup in languid fashion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I am come to Persiä again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Land of <span xml:lang="fr">cocagne</span>.</span>
