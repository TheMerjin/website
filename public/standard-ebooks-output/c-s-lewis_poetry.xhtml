					<br/>
					<span>The public crêche engulfed him with the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And twenty separate Boards of Education</span>

					<span>Closed round him. He was passed through every test,</span>

					<span>Was vaccinated, numbered, washed and dressed,</span>

					<span>Then came the moment that undid the whole⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span>It came in lecture-time one April morning</span>

					<span>He looked up to the window. A brown bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perched on the sill, bent down to whet his beak</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With darting head⁠—Poor Dymer watched and stirred</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uneasily. The lecturer’s voice he heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still droning from the dais. The narrow room</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Tingled down all his spine and loosed his knees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slow-drawn, like an invisible caress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He laughed⁠—The lecturer stopped like one that sees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Ghost, then frowned and murmured, “Silence, please.”</span>

					<span>That moment saw the soul of Dymer hang</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Men said: “There’s Dymer”⁠—“Why, what’s Dymer doing?”</span>

					<span>So Dymer in the wood-lawn blessed the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A still light, rosy, clear, and filled with sounds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here was some pile of building which the night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made larger. Spiry shadows rose all round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through the open door appeared profound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Recesses of pure light⁠—fire with no flame⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And out of that deep light the music came.</span>

					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>The archway. There was neither fence to pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor word of challenge given, nor bolted door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But where it’s open, open evermore,</span>

					<span>Opening ahead. It swilled with soft excess,</span>

					<span>His eyes yet quivering from the dregs of night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it was nowhere more and nowhere less:</span>
					<br/>

					<span>A white blot on the floor, at such a pace</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As boats that hardly seem to have changed place</span>

					<span>The shouting mood had withered from his heart;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The oppression of huge places wrapped him round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A great misgiving sent its fluttering dart</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Deep into him⁠—some fear of being found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some hope to find he knew not what. The sound</span>

					<span>Of music, never ceasing, took the role</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of silence and like silence numbed his soul.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>That came to meet him: and beyond was spread</span>

					<span>With body intent he felt the foliage quiver</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On breast and thighs. With groping arms he made</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wide passes in the air. A sacred shiver</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of joy from the heart’s centre oddly strayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To every nerve. Deep sighing, much afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much wondering, he went on: then, stooping, found</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A knee-depth of warm pillows on the ground.</span>

					<span>And there it was sweet rapture to lie still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eyes open on the dark. A flowing health</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bathed him from head to foot and great goodwill</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose springing in his heart and poured its wealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outwards. Then came a hand as if by stealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the dark and touched his hand: and after</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beating silence budded into laughter:</span>

				<p>
					<span>—A low grave laugh and rounded like a pearl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mysterious, filled with home. He opened wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His arms. The breathing body of a girl</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Slid into them. From the world’s end, with the stride</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of seven-leagued boots came passion to his side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, meeting mouths, soft-falling hair, a cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heart-shaken flank, sudden cool-folded thigh:</span>

					<span>The same nights swelled the mushroom in earth’s lap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And silvered the wet fields: it drew the bud</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From hiding and led on the rhythmic sap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sent the young wolves thirsting after blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, wheeling the big seas, made ebb and flood</span>

					<br/>
					<span>In dead sleep till the time of morning dew.</span>

					<span>He woke, and all at once before his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pale spires of the chestnut-trees in bloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rose waving and, beyond, dove-coloured skies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But where he lay was dark and, out of gloom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He saw them, through the doorway of a room</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full of strange scents and softness, padded deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With growing leaves, heavy with last night’s sleep.</span>

					<span>He rubbed his eyes. He felt that chamber wreathing</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New sleepiness around him. At his side</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was aware of warmth and quiet breathing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Twice he sank back, loose-limbed and drowsy-eyed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the wind came even there. A sparrow cried</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wood shone without. Then Dymer rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—“Just for one glance,” he said, and went, tip-toes,</span>

					<span>Out into crisp grey air and drenching grass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whitened cobweb sparkling in its place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clung to his feet. He saw the wagtail pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside him and the thrush: and from his face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felt the thin-scented winds divinely chase</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flush of sleep. Far off he saw, between</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trees, long morning shadows of dark green.</span>

					<span>He stretched his lazy arms to their full height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yawning, and sighed and laughed, and sighed anew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then wandered farther, watching with delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How his broad naked footprints stained the dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—Pressing his foot to feel the cold come through</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the spreading toes⁠—then wheeled round</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each moment to some new, shrill forest sound.</span>

					<span>The wood with its cold flowers had nothing there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More beautiful than he, new waked from sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New born from joy. His soul lay very bare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That moment to life’s touch, and pondering deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now first he knew that no desire could keep</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These hours for always, and that men do die</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—But oh, the present glory of lungs and eye!</span>

					<span>He thought: “At home they are waking now. The stair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is filled with feet. The bells clang⁠—far from me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where am I now? I could not point to where</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The City lies from here,”⁠ ⁠… then, suddenly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I were here alone, these woods could be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A frightful place! But now I have met my friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who loves me, we can talk to the road’s end.”</span>

					<span>Thus, quickening with the sweetness of the tale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his new love, he turned. He saw, between</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young leaves, where the palace walls showed pale</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With chilly stone: but far above the green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Springing like cliffs in air, the towers were seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Making more quiet yet the quiet dawn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither he came. He reached the open lawn.</span>

					<span>No bird was moving here. Against the wall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the unscythed grass the nettle grew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doors stood open wide, but no footfall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rang in the colonnades. Whispering through</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arches and hollow halls the lights wind blew⁠ ⁠…</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His awe returned. He whistled⁠—then, no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s better to plunge in by the first door.</span>

					<span>But then the vastness threw him into doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was this the door that he had found last night?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or that, beneath the tower? Had he come out</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This side at all? As the first snow falls light</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With following rain before the year grows white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the first, dim foreboding touched his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gently as yet, and easily thrust behind.</span>

					<span>And with it came the thought, “I do not know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her name⁠—no, nor her face.” But still his mood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ran blithely as he felt the morning blow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>About him, and the earth-smell in the wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed waking for long hours that must be good</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, in the unfettered lands, that knew no cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For grudging⁠—out of reach of the old laws.</span>

					<span>He hastened to one entry. Up the stair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the pillared porch, without delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He ran⁠—then halted suddenly: for there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the quiet threshold something lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bundle, a dark mass that barred the way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He looked again, and lo, the formless pile</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under his eyes was moving all the while.</span>

					<span>And it had hands, pale hands of wrinkled flesh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Puckered and gnarled with vast antiquity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That moved. He eyed the sprawling thing afresh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bit by bit (so faces come to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the red coal) yet surely, he could see</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the swathed hugeness was uncleanly human,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A living thing, the likeness of a woman.</span>

					<span>In the centre a draped hummock marked the head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence flowed the broader lines with curve and fold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spreading as oak roots do. You would have said</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man could hid among them and grow old</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In finding a way out. Breast manifold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of the Ephesian Artemis might be</span>

					<span>And all his being answered, “Not that way!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never a word he spoke. Stealthily creeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Back from the door he drew. Quick! No delay!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quick, quick, but very quiet!⁠—backward peeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till fairly out of sight. Then shouting, leaping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shaking himself, he ran⁠—as puppies do</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From bathing⁠—till that door was out of view.</span>

					<span>Another gate⁠—and empty. In he went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And found a courtyard open to the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amidst it dripped a fountain. Heavy scent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of flowers was here; the foxglove standing high</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sheltered the whining wasp. With hasty eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He travelled round the walls. One doorway led</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within: one showed a further court ahead.</span>

					<span>He ran up to the first⁠—a hungry lover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not yet taught to endure, not blunted yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But weary of long waiting to discover</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That loved one’s face. Before his foot was set</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the first stair, he felt the sudden sweat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cold on his sides. That sprawling mass in view,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That shape⁠—the horror of heaviness⁠—here too.</span>

					<span>He fell back from the porch. Not yet⁠—not yet⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There must be other ways where he would meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No watcher in the door. He would not let</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fear rise, nor hope falter, nor defeat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be entered in his thoughts. A sultry heat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seemed to have filled the day. His breath came short,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And (like a dream) the sight he feared to find</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was waiting here. Then cloister, path and square</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hastened through: down paths that ended blind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Traced and retraced his steps. The thing sat there</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In every door, still watching, everywhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind, ahead, all around⁠—So! Steady now,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>That he had dreamed of such a place before</span>

					<span>—Knew how it all would end. He must be caught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Early or late. No good! But all the more</span>

					<span>He raged with passionate will that overbore</span>

					<span>That horror: tread her down, force his way through,</span>

					<span>Or die upon the threshold. And this too</span>

					<span>Now, in a dream, muttering: “I’ve not the trick.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s no good. I’m no good. They’re all too quick.</span>

					<span>There! Look there! Look at that!”⁠—so Dymer stood,</span>

					<span>With prisoners now, clamouring to take and try them</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And eyes on earth, grown dogged, Dymer came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who all the long day in the woods had fled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the horror of those lips that screamed his name</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cursed him. Busy wonder and keen shame</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Seven times enfolded in the idle hills,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There came a chilly pause to his distress,</span>

					<span>A cloud of the deep world-despair that fills</span>

					<span>A man’s heart like the incoming tide and kills</span>

					<span>Came dropping and the stars peered one by one</span>

					<span>And now his eyes were closed. Perhaps he slept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lapt in unearthly quiet⁠—never knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How bit by bit the fog’s white rearguard crept</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the crest and faded, and the blue</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First brightening at the zenith trembled through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And deepening shadows took a sharper form</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each moment, and the sandy earth grew warm.</span>

					<span>Yet, dreaming of blue skies, in dream he heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pure voice of lark that seemed to send</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its song from heights beyond all height. That bird</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang out heaven, “The world will never end,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang from the gates of heavens, “Will never end.”</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>But bright space and one voice set there to sing.</span>

					<span>It seemed to be the murmur and the voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or beings beyond number, each and all</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Singing <strong>I am</strong>. Each of itself made choice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And was: whence flows the justice that men call</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divine. She keeps the great worlds lest they fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From hour to hour, and makes the hills renew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their ancient youth and sweetens all things through.</span>

					<span>It seemed to be the low voice of the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Brooding alone beneath the strength of things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Murmuring of days and nights and years unfurled</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Out of old fields the flowers of unborn springs,</span>

					<span>Out of old wars and cities burned with wrong,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>The dream ran thin towards waking, and he knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was but a bird’s piping with no sense.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He rolled round on his back. The sudden blue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Quivering with light, heard, cloudless and intense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shone over him. The lark still sounded thence</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stirred him at the heart. Some spacious thought</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was passing by too gently to be caught.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And sat upright. The perilous cliff dropped sheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before him, close at hand, and from his place</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listening in mountain silence he could hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Birds crying far below. It was not fear</span>

					<br/>
					<span>—Wide pools that in the sun-splashed foothills lay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sheep-doted downs, soft-piled, and rolling heath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>River and shining weir and steeples grey</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the green waves of forest. Far away</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distance rose heaped on distance: nearer hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The white roads leading down to a new land.</span>

					<span>The sun was high in heaven and Dymer stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bright speck on the endless mountain-side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, blossom after blossom, that rich mood</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faded and truth rolled homeward, like a tide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before whose edge the weak soul fled to hide</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In vain, with ostrich head, through many a shape</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of coward fancy, whimpering for escape.</span>

					<span>But only for a moment; then his soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Took the full swell and heaved a dripping prow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clear of the shattering wave-crest. He was whole.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No veils should hide the truth, no truth should cow</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dear self-pitying heart. “I’ll babble now</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer,” Dymer said. “I’m broken in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pack up the dreams and let the life begin.”</span>

					<span>With this he turned. “I must have food to-day,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He muttered. Then among the cloudless hills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By winding tracks he sought the downward way</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And followed the steep course of tumbling rills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—Came to the glens the wakening mountain fills</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In springtime with the echoing splash and shock</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of waters leaping cold from rock to rock.</span>

				<p>
					<span>And still, it seemed that lark with its refrain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sang in the sky, and wind was in his hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hope at heart. Then once, and once again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He heard a gun fired off. It broke the air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a stone breaks a pond, and everywhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dry crags echoed clear: and at the sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once a big bird rose whirring from the ground.</span>

					<span>In half an hour he reached the level land</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And followed the field-paths and crossed the stiles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then looked and saw, near by, on his left hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An old house, folded round with billowy piles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of dark yew hedge. The moss was on the tiles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pigeons in the yard, and in the tower</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A clock that had no hands and told no hour.</span>

					<span>He hastened. In warm waves the garden scent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came stronger at each stride. The mountain breeze</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was gone. He reached the gates; then in he went</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seemed to lose the sky⁠—such weight of trees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hung overhead. He heard the noise of bees</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw, far off, in the blue shade between</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The windless elms, one walking on the green.</span>

					<span>It was a mighty man whose beardless face</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath grey hair shone out so large and mild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It made a sort of moonlight in the place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A dreamy desperation, wistful-wild,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Showed in his glance and gait: yet like a child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An Asian emperor’s only child, was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With his grave looks and bright solemnity.</span>

					<span>And over him there hung in the witching air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wilful courtesy, of the days of old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The graces wherein idleness grows fair;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And somewhat in his sauntering walk he rolled</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And toyed about his waist with seals of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or stood to ponder often in mid-stride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tilting his heavy head upon one side.</span>

					<span>When Dymer had called twice, he turned his eye:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, coming out of silence (as a star</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All in one moment slips into the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of evening, yet we feel it comes from far),</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said, “Sir, you are welcome. Few there are</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That come my way”: and in huge hands he pressed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dymer’s cold hand and bade him into rest.</span>

					<span>My gun? It was but now I killed a lark.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What, Sir,” said Dymer; “shoot the singing bird?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sir,” said the man, “they sing from dawn till dark,</span>

					<span>And interrupt my dreams too long. But hark⁠ ⁠…</span>

					<span>Stand here, Sir, at the dial.” Dymer stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master pointed; then he looked and saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How hedges and the funeral quietude</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of black trees fringed the garden like a wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And only, in one place, one gap that showed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blue side of the hills, the white hill-road.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>He said, “because this too makes war upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The art of dream. But by some great mishap</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing I plant will grow there. We pass on⁠ ⁠…</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sunshine of the afternoon is gone.</span>

					<span>They passed from the hot lawn into the gloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And coolness of the porch: then, past a door</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That opened with no noise, into a room</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where green leaves choked the window and the floor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sank lower than the ground. A tattered store.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of brown books met the eye: a crystal ball:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And masks with empty eyes along the wall.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Then Dymer sat, but knew not how nor where,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And supper was set out before these two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—He saw not how⁠—with silver old and rare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tarnished. And he ate and never knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What meats they were. At every bite he grew</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More drowsy and let slide his crumbling will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master at his side was talking still.</span>

					<span>And all his talk was tales of magic words</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of the nations in the clouds above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Astral and aerish tribes who fish for birds</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With angles. And by history he could prove</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How chosen spirits from earth had won their love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Arthur, or Usheen: and to their isle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Went Helen for the sake of a Greek smile.</span>

					<span>And ever in his talk he mustered well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His texts and strewed old authors round the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thus Wierus writes,” and “Thus the Hermetics tell,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This was Agrippa’s view,” and “Others say</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With Cardan,” till he had stolen quite away</span>

					<span>Dymer was talking now. Now Dymer told</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of his own love and losing, drowsily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master leaned towards him, “Was it cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This spirit, to the touch?”⁠—“No, Sir, not she,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said Dymer. And his host: “Why this must be</span>

					<span>Be still⁠ ⁠… but wait. Tell on, Sir, tell the whole.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>Then Dymer told him of the beldam too,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old, old, matriarchal dreadfulness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the Master’s face a shadow drew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shifted in his chair and “Yes” and “Yes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He murmured twice. “I never looked for less!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Always the same⁠ ⁠… that frightful woman shape</span>

					<span>Besets the dream-way and the soul’s escape.”</span>

					<span>A huge indifference fell upon his host,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Forgive me. You are young. What helps us most</span>

					<span>Is to find out again that heavenly ghost</span>

					<br/>

					<span>The quarter striking from a neighbouring tower.</span>

					<span>Even as he heard the wicket clash behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came a great wind beneath that seemed to tear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The solid graves apart; and deaf and blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whirled him upright, like smoke, through towering air</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose levels were as steps of a sky stair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The parching cold roughened his throat with thirst</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly all round him he could hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sad strings that fretted inconsolably</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ominous horns that blew both far and near.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There broke his human heart, and his last tear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Froze scalding on his chin. But while he heard</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The spring of tears forever and compress</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From off his lips the curved bow of the boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever. The sidereal loneliness</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Received him, where no journeying leaves the less</span>

					<span>And here the well-worn fabric of our life</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fell from him. Hope and purpose were cut short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>—Even the blind trust that reaches in mid-strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards some heart of things. Here blew the mort</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the world spirit herself. The last support</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was fallen away⁠—Himself, one spark of soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swam in unbroken void. He was the whole,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Was there no world at all, but only I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dreaming of gods and men?” Then suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He felt the wind no more: he seemed to fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faster than light but free, and scaled the sky</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In his own strength⁠—as if a falling stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Should wake to find the world’s will was its own.</span>

					<span>Leaning upon its spear, with hurrying skies</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind it and a moonset red as blood.</span>
					<br/>

					<span>And as he heard it, Dymer at one bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stood in the stranger’s shadow, with the spear</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And gloriously it sang. But now the brute</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lurched forward: and he saw the weapon shoot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beyond it and fall quivering on the field.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dymer drew out his sword and raised the shield.</span>

				<span>Full of soft streams and little winds that creep</span>

			<p>
				<span>A hollow cup above the ocean placed</span>

				<span>Where nothing rough, nor loud, nor harsh shall be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But woodland light and shadow interlaced</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And summer sky and sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There in the fragrant twilight I will raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A secret altar of the rich sea sod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whereat to offer sacrifice and praise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto my lonely god:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Due sacrifice of his own drowsy flowers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The deadening poppies in an ocean shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Round which through all forgotten days and hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The great seas wove their spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So may he send me dreams of dear delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And draughts of cool oblivion, quenching pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sweet, half-wakeful moments in the night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear the falling rain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when he meets me at the dusk of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To call me home for ever, this I ask⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That he may lead me friendly on that way</span>

				<span>For all our hopes in endless ruin lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The good is dead. Let us curse God most High.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Four thousand years of toil and hope and thought</span>

				<span>Wherein man laboured upward and still wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>New worlds and better, Thou hast made as naught.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And our few happy days of little worth.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Even if it be not all a dream in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—The ancient hope that still will rise again⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of a just God that cares for earthly pain,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet far away beyond our labouring night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He wanders in the depths of endless light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing alone his musics of delight;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Only the far, spent echo of his song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our dungeons and deep cells can smite along,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Thou art nearer. Thou art very strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O universal strength, I know it well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is but froth of folly to rebel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For thou art Lord and hast the keys of Hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet I will not bow down to thee nor love thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For looking in my own heart I can prove thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And know this frail, bruised being is above thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our love, our hope, our thirsting for the right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our mercy and long seeking of the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall we change these for thy relentless might?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Laugh then and slay. Shatter all things of worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Heap torment still on torment for thy mirth⁠—</span>

				<span>Thou art not Lord while there are Men on earth.</span>

				<span>I am the Lord your God: even he that made</span>

				<span>Material things, and all these signs arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above you and have set beneath the race</span>

				<br/>
				<span>Dream of some other gods and disobey</span>

				<span>My warnings, and despise my holy laws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even tho’ their sin shall slay them. For which cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreams dreamed in vain, a never-filled desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in close flesh a spiritual fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A thirst for good their kind shall not attain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A backward cleaving to the beast again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A loathing for the life that I have given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A haunted, twisted soul for ever riven</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Between their will and mine⁠—such lot I give</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While still in my despite the vermin live.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They hate my world! Then let that other God</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come from the outer spaces glory-shod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And from this castle I have built on Night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Steal forth my own thought’s children into light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>If such an one there be. But far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He walks the airy fields of endless day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And my rebellious sons have called Him long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And vainly called. My order still is strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And like to me nor second none I know.</span>

				<span>Trapped amid the woods with guile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ve led her hound in fetters vile</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To death, a deadlier sorceress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than any born for earth’s distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Since first the winner of the fleece</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bore home the Colchian witch to Greece⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven months with snare and gin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They’ve sought the maid o’erwise within</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The forest’s labyrinthine shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The lonely woodman half afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Far off her ragged form has seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sauntering down the alleys green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or crouched in godless prayer alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At eve before a Druid stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now the bitter chase is won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The quarry’s caught, her magic’s done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bishop’s brought her strongest spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To naught with candle, book, and bell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holy water splashed upon her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>She goes to burning and dishonour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Too deeply damned to feel her shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For, though beneath her hair of flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Her thoughtful head be lowly bowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It droops for meditation proud</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Impenitent, and pondering yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Things no memory can forget,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Starry wonders she has seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brooding in the wildwood green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With holiness. For who can say</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In what strange crew she loved to play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What demons or what gods of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep mysteries unto her have told</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At dead of night in worship bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>At ruined shrines magnificent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or how the quivering will she sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone into the great alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where all is loved and all is known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who now lifts up her maiden eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looks around with soft surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon the noisy, crowded square,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The city oafs that nod and stare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bishop’s court that gathers there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The faggots and the blackened stake</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where sinners die for justice’ sake?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now she is set upon the pile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The mob grows still a little while,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till lo! before the eager folk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Up curls a thin, blue line of smoke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Alas!” the full-fed burghers cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“That evil loveliness must die!”</span>

			<p>
				<span>So piteously the lonely soul of man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shudders before this universal plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So grievous is the burden and the pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So heavy weighs the long, material chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From cause to cause, too merciless for hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The nightmare march of unrelenting fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I think that he must die thereof unless</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ever and again across the dreariness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There came a sudden glimpse of spirit faces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A fragrant breath to tell of flowery places</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wider oceans, breaking on the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From which the hearts of men are always sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It lies beyond endeavour; neither prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor fasting, nor much wisdom winneth there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seeing how many prophets and wise men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have sought for it and still returned again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hope undone. But only the strange power</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of unsought Beauty in some casual hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Can build a bridge of light or sound or form</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead you out of all this strife and storm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When of some beauty we are grown a part</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till from its very glory’s midmost heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out leaps a sudden beam of larger light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into our souls. All things are seen aright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the blinding pillar of its gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seven times more true than what for truth we hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In vulgar hours. The miracle is done</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And for one little moment we are one</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the eternal stream of loveliness</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That flows so calm, aloft from all distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet leaps and lives around us as a fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making us faint with overstrong desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sport and swim for ever in its deep⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only a moment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i8">O! but we shall keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our vision still. One moment was enough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We know we are not made of mortal stuff.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And we can bear all trials that come after,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hate of men and the fool’s loud bestial laughter</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Nature’s rule and cruelties unclean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For we have seen the Glory⁠—we have seen.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>While in his veins the gradual blood</span>

				<span>Slackens to a marish flood?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For he rejoiceth not in the ocean’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neither the sun giveth delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the moon by night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall call his feet to wander in the haunted forest lawn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He shall no more rise suddenly in the dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When mists are white and the dew lies pearly</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cold and cold on every meadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To take his joy of the season early,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The opening flower and the westward shadow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And scarcely can he dream of laughter and love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They lie so many leaden years behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Such eyes are dim and blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the sad, aching head that nods above</span>

				<span>His monstrous books can never know</span>

				<span>School him over-deep in treason</span>

				<span>Summer is queen in all the happy land.</span>

				<span>Into their cloudy peaks when day was done⁠—</span>

				<br/>
				<span>With the waste song whose melodies I’d follow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weary not for many a summer day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Born of the vaulted breakers arching hollow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before they flash and scatter into spray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On, if we should be weary of their play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Then I would lead you further into land</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where, with their ragged walls, the stately rocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shut in smooth courts and paved with quiet sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To silence dedicate. The sea-god’s flocks</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have rested here, and mortal eyes have seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By great adventure at the dead of noon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A lonely nereid drowsing half a-swoon</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Buried beneath her dark and dripping locks.</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Your Spirit, Master, has been close at hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And guided me, still pointing treasures rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick-sown where I before saw nothing fair</span>

				<span>The stars come out; the fragrant shadows fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About a dreaming garden still and sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the unseen bats above me bleat</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the ghostly moths their hunting call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And twinkling glow-worms all about me crawl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now for a chamber dim, a pillow meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For slumbers deep as death, a faultless sheet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cool, white and smooth. So may I reach the hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With poppies strewn where sleep that is so dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With magic sponge can wipe away an hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or twelve and make them naught. Why not a year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Why could a man not loiter in that bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Until a thousand painless cycles wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And then⁠—what if it held him evermore?</span>

			<p>
				<span>See! the pale autumn dawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is faint, upon the lawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lies in powdered white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Of hour-frost dight</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now from tree to tree</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hung like a silver pall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">To hallow all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It wreathes the burdened air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So strangely everywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I could almost fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">This silence drear</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where no one song-bird sings</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dream that wizard things</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mighty for hate or love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Were close above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>White as the fog and fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Drifting through middle air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In magic dances dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Over my head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet these should know me too</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lover and bondman true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that has honoured well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">The mystic spell</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of earth’s most solemn hours</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein the ancient powers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of dryad, elf, or faun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or leprechaun</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft have their faces shown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To me that walked alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seashore or haunted fen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Or mountain glen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wherefore I will not fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To walk the woodlands sere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into this autumn day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i2">Far, far away.</span>

				<span>Suddenly there came to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The music of a mighty sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That on a bare and iron shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thundered with a deeper roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Than all the tides that leap and run</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With us below the real sun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the place was far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Above, beyond our homely day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Neighbouring close the frozen clime</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where out of all the woods of time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the frightful seraphim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The fierce, cold eyes of Godhead gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Revolving hate and misery</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wars and famines yet to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in my dreams I stood alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Upon a shelf of weedy stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And saw before my shrinking eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The dark, enormous breakers rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hover and fall with deafening thunder</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of thwarted foam that echoed under</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ledge, through many a cavern drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With hollow sounds of wintry fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through the waters waste and grey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thick-strown for many a league away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the toiling sea arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Many a face and form of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thin, elemental people dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who live beyond our heavy sphere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all at once from far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>They all held out their arms to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Crying in their melody,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“Leap in! Leap in, and take thy fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of all the cosmic good and ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be as the Living ones that know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Enormous joy, enormous woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pain beyond thought and fiery bliss:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For all thy study hunted this,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On wings of magic to arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And wash from off thy filmed eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The cloud of cold mortality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To find the real life and be</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As are the children of the deep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Be bold and dare the glorious leap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or to thy shame, go, slink again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the narrow ways of men.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span>So all these mocked me as I stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Striving to wake because I feared the flood.</span>

				<p epub:type="title">In Praise of Solid People</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Thank God that there are solid folk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who water flowers and roll the lawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And sit and sew and talk and smoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And snore all through the summer dawn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who pass untroubled nights and days</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full-fed and sleepily content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rejoicing and each other’s praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Respectable and innocent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who feel the things that all men feel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And think in well-worn grooves of thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whose honest spirits never reel</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Before man’s mystery, overwrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet not unfaithful nor unkind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With work-day virtues surely staid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Theirs is the sane and humble mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And dull affections undismayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O happy people! I have seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No verse yet written in your praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And, truth to tell, the time has been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I would have scorned your easy ways.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But now thro’ weariness and strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I learn your worthiness indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The world is better for such life</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As stout suburban people lead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Too often have I sat alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When the wet night falls heavily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fretting winds around me moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And homeless longing vexes me</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For lore that I shall never know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And visions none can hope to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till brooding works upon me so</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A childish fear steals over me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I look around the empty room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clock still ticking in its place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all else silent as the tomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till suddenly, I think, a face</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Grows from the darkness just beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I turn, and lo! it fades away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And soon another phantom tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of shifting dreams begins to play,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And dusky galleys past me sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full freighted on a faerie sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the silken merchants hail</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Across the ringing waves to me</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—Then suddenly, again, the room,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Familiar books about me piled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I alone amid the gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By one more mocking dream beguiled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And still no neared to the Light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And still no further from myself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone and lost in clinging night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—(The clock’s still ticking on the shelf).</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then do I envy solid folk</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who sit of evenings by the fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After their work and doze and smoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And are not fretted by desire.</span>

				<p epub:type="title">Song of the Pilgrims</p>

			<p>
				<span>O Dwellers at the back of the North Wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What have we done to you? How have we sinned</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering the Earth from Orkney unto Ind?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With many deaths our fellowship is thinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our flesh is withered in the parching wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering the earth from Orkney unto Ind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We have no rest. We cannot turn again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Back to the world and all her fruitless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Having once sought the land where ye remain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some say ye are not. But, ah God! we know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That somewhere, somewhere past the Northern snow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting for us the red-rose gardens blow:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—The red-rose and the white-rose gardens blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the green Northern land to which we go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Surely the ways are long and the years are slow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We have forsaken all things sweet and fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We have found nothing worth a moment’s care</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the real flowers are blowing there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Land of the Lotus fallen from the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Land of the Lake from whence all rivers run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Land where the hope of all our dreams is won!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Shall we not somewhere see at close of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The green walls of that country far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And hear the music of her fountains play?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So long we have been wandering all this while</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By many a perilous sea and drifting isle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We scarce shall dare to look thereon and smile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yea, when we are drawing very near to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And when at last the ivory port we see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Our hearts will faint with mere felicity:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But we shall wake again in gardens bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of green and gold for infinite delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sleeping beneath the solemn mountains white,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While from the flowery copses still unseen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sing out the crooning birds that ne’er have been</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Touched by the hand of winter frore and lean;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ever living queens that grow not old</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And poets wise in robes of faerie gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whisper a wild, sweet song that first was told</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ere God sat down to make the Milky Way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And in those gardens we shall sleep and play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For ever and for ever and a day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An, Dwellers at the back of the North Wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What have we done to you? How have we sinned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That yes should hide beyond the Northern wind?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Land of the Lotus, fallen from the Sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When shall your hidden, flowery vales be won</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the travail of our way be done?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Very far we have searched; we have even seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Scythian waste that bears no soft nor green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And near the Hideous Pass our feet have been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>We have heard Syrens singing all night long</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beneath the unknown stars their lonely song</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In friendless seas beyond the Pillars strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor by the dragon-daughter of Hypocras</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor the vale of the Devil’s head we have feared to pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet is our labour lost and vain, alas!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scouring the earth from Orkney unto Ind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Tossed on the seas and withered in the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We seek and seek your land. How have we sinned?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or is it all a folly of the wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bidding us walk these ways with blinded eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While all around us real flowers arise?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, by the very God, we know, we know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That somewhere still, beyond the Northern snow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Waiting for us the red-rose gardens blow.</span>

				<p epub:type="title">The Ass</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>I woke and rose and slipt away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To the heathery hills in the morning grey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In a field where the dew lay cold and deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I met an ass, new-roused from sleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I stroked his nose and I tickled his ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And spoke soft words to quiet his fears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His eyes stared into the eyes of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And he kissed my hands of his courtesy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O big, brown brother out of the waste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How do thistles for breakfast taste?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And do you rejoice in the dawn divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a heart that is glad no less than mine?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For, brother, the depth of your gentle eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is strange and mystic as the skies:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What are the thoughts that grope behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down in the mist of a donkey mind?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Can it be true, as the wise men tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That you are a mask of God as well,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, as in us, so in you no less</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Speaks the eternal Loveliness,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And words of the lips that all things know</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among the thoughts of a donkey go?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“However it be, O four-foot brother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fair to-day is the earth, our mother.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“God send you peace and delight thereof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all green meat of the waste you love,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And guard you well from violent men</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who’d put you back in the shafts again.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the ass had far too wise a head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To answer one of the things I said,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So he twitched his fair ears up and down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And turned to nuzzle his shoulder brown.</span>

				<span>And underneath my feet the cold, wet lawn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With dew was twinkling bright.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cobwebs hung from every branch and spray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Gleaming with pearly strands of laden thread,</span>

				<span>And long and still the morning shadows lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across the meadows spread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At that pure hour when yet no sound of man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Stirs in the whiteness of the wakening earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Alone through innocent solitudes I ran</span>

				<span>Till I had found the open mountain heath</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yellow with gorse, and rested there and stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gaze upon the misty sea beneath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or on the neighbouring wood,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—That little wood of hazel and tall pine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And youngling fir, where oft we have loved to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The level beams of early morning shine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Freshly from tree to tree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through the denser wood there’s many a pool</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of deep and night-born shadow lingers yet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the new-wakened flowers are damp and cool</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the long grass is wet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the sweet heather long I rested there</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Looking upon the dappled, early sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When suddenly, from out the shining air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A god came flashing by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Swift, naked, eager, pitilessly fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With a live crown of birds about his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing and fluttering, and his fiery hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far out behind him spread,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Streamed like a rippling torch upon the breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of his own glorious swiftness: in the grass</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He bruised no feathery stalk, and through the trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw his whiteness pass.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when I followed him beyond the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lo! He was changed into a solemn bull</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That there upon the open pasture stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And browsed his lazy full.</span>

				<span>I stand on the windy uplands among the hills of Down</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With all the world spread out beneath, meadow and sea and town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And ploughlands on the far-off hills that glow with friendly brown.</span>

				<span>And ever across the rolling land to the far horizon line,</span>

				<span>Where the blue hills border the misty west, I see the white roads twine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The rare roads and the fair roads that call this heart of mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I see them dip in the valleys and vanish and rise and bend</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From shadowy dell to windswept fell, and still to the West they wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And over the cold blue ridge at last to the great world’s uttermost end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the call of the roads is upon me, a desire in my spirit has grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To wander forth in the highways, ’twixt earth and sky alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And seek for the lands no foot has trod and the seas no sail had known:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—For the lands to the west of the evening and east of the morning’s birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where the gods unseen in their valleys green are glad at the ends of the earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And fear no morrow to bring them sorrow, nor night to quench their mirth.</span>

				<span>Hung with silver, hung with pall,</span>

				<span>Love, there is a castle built in a country desolate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On a rock above a forest where the trees are grim and great,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Blasted with the lightning sharp⁠—giant boulders strewn between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the mountains rise above, and the cold ravine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Echoes to the crushing roar and thunder of a mighty river</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Raging down a cataract. Very tower and forest quiver</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the grey wolves are afraid and the call of birds is drowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the thought and speech of man in the boiling water’s sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But upon the further side of the barren, sharp ravine</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With the sunlight on its turrets is the castle seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Calm and very wonderful, white above the green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of the wet and waving forest, slanted all away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Because the driving Northern wind will not rest by night or day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet the towers are sure above, very mighty is the stead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The gates are made of ivory, the roofs of copper red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Round and round the warders grave walk upon the walls for ever</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wakeful dragons couch in the ports of ivory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nothing is can trouble it, hate of the gods nor man’s endeavour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And it shall be a resting-place, dear heart, for you and me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through the wet and waving forest with an age-old sorrow laden</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing of the world’s regret wanders wild the faerie maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through the thistle and the brier, through the tangles of the thorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till her eyes be dim with weeping and her homeless feet are torn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Often to the castle gate up she looks with vain endeavour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For her soulless loveliness to the castle winneth never.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But within the sacred court, hidden high upon the mountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wandering in the castle gardens lovely folk enough there be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathing in another air, drinking of a purer fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And among that folk, beloved, there’s a place for you and me.</span>

				<br/>
				<span>And driven and hurt beyond bearing this summer day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the heat and the pain together suddenly fall away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All’s cool and green.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But a moment agone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Among men cursing in fight and toiling, blinded I fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But the labour passed on a sudden even as a passing thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And now⁠—alone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, to be ever alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In flowery valleys among the mountains and silent wastes untrod,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the dewy upland places, in the garden of God,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>This would atone!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I shall not see</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The brutal, crowded faces around me, that in their toil have grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into the faces of devils⁠—yea, even as my own⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>When I find thee,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Country of Dreams!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond the tide of the ocean, hidden and sunk away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Out of the sound of battles, near to the end of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of dim woods and streams.</span>

				<span>In her people’s heart and head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even as it lies for ever upon her coasts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Making them dim and dreamy lest her sons should ever arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And remember all their boasts;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For I know that the colourless skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the blurred horizons breed</span>

				<span>Lonely desire and many words and brooding and never a deed.</span>

				<span>Last night I dreamed that I was come again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unto the house where my belovèd dwells</span>
				<br/>
				<span>After long years of wandering and pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And I stood out beneath the drenching rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all the street was bare, and black with night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But in my true love’s house was warmth and light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet I could not draw near nor enter in,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And long I wondered if some secret sin</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or old, unhappy anger held me fast;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till suddenly it came into my head</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That I was killed long since and lying dead⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only a homeless wraith that way had passed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So thus I found my true love’s house again</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And stood unseen amid the winter night</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the lamp burned within, a rosy light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the wet street was shining in the rain.</span>

				<span>If men should ask, Despoina, why I tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of nothing glad nor noble in my verse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lighten hearts beneath this present curse</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And build a heaven of dreams in real hell,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Go you to them and speak among them thus:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>“There were no greater grief than to recall,</span>

				<span>Down in the rotting grave where the lithe worms crawl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Green fields above that smiled so sweet to us.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is it good to tell old tales of Troynovant</span>

				<span>Or praises of dead heroes, tried and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or sing the queens of unforgotten age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Brynhild and Maeve and virgin Bradamant?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How should I sing of them? Can it be good</span>

				<span>To think of glory now, when all is done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all our labour underneath the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Has brought us this⁠—and not the thing we would?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All these were rosy visions of the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The loveliness and wisdom feigned of old.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now we wake. The East is pale and cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No hope is in the dawn, and no delight.</span>

				<p epub:type="title">Ode for New Year’s Day</p>
			</hgroup>
			<p>
				<span>Woe unto you, ye sons of pain that are this day in earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Now cry for all your torment: now curse your hour of birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the fathers who begat your to a portion nothing worth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And Thou, my own belovèd, for as brave as ere thou art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bow down thine head, Despoina, clasp thy pale arms over it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Lie low with fast-closed eyelids, clenched teeth, enduring heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For sorrow on sorrow is coming wherein all flesh has part.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sky above is sickening, the clouds of God’s hate cover it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Body and soul shall suffer beyond all word or thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till the pain and noisy terror that these first years have wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Seem but the soft arising and prelude of the storm</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That fiercer still and heavier with sharper lightnings fraught</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shall pour red wrath upon us over a world deform.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thrice happy, O Despoina, were the men who were alive</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the great age and the golden age when still the cycle ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On upward curve and easily, for then both maid and man</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And beast and tree and spirit in the green earth could thrive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But now one age is ending, and God calls home the stars</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And looses the wheel of the ages and sends it spinning back</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Amid the death of nations, and points a downward track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And madness is come over us and great and little wars.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He has not left one valley, one isle of fresh and green</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Where old friends could forgather amid the howling wreck.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It’s vainly we are praying. We cannot, cannot check</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The Power who slays and puts aside the beauty that has been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It’s truth they tell, Despoina, none hears the eart’s complaining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For Nature will not pity, nor the red God lend an ear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Yet I too have been mad in the hour of bitter paining</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lifted up my voice to God, thinking that he could hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The curse wherewith I cursed Him because the Good was dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>But lo! I am grown wiser, knowing that our own hearts</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Have made a phantom called the Good, while a few years have sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Over a little planet. And what should the great Lord know of it</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Who tosses the dust of chaos and gives the suns their parts?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Hither and thither he moves them; for an hour we see the show of it:</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Only a little hour, and the life of the race is done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And here he builds a nebula, and there he slays a sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And works his own fierce pleasure. All things he shall fulfill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And O, my poor Despoina, do you think he ever hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The wail of hearts he has broken, the sounds of human ill?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He cares not for our virtues, our little hopes and fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And how could it all go on, love, if he knew of laughter and tears?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah, sweet, if a man could cheat him! If you could flee away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Into some other country beyond the rosy West,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hide in the deep forests and be for ever at rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span>From the rankling hate of God and the outworn world’s decay!</span>

			<p>
				<span>After the fret and failure of this day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And weariness of thought, O Mother Night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come with soft kiss to soothe our care away</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And all our little tumults set to right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Most pitiful of all death’s kindred fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Riding above us through the curtained air</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On thy dusk car, thou scatterest to the earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sweet dreams and drowsy charms of tender might</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And lovers’ dear delight before to-morrow’s birth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thus art thou wont thy quiet lands to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And pillared courts beyond the Milky Way</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Wherein thou tarriest all our solar day</span>
				<br/>
				<span>While unsubstantial dreams before thee weave</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A foamy dance, and fluttering fancies play</span>
				<br/>
				<span>About thy palace in the silver ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of some far, moony globe. But when the hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The long-expected comes, the ivory gates</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Open on noiseless hinge before thy bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Unbidden, and the jewelled chariot waits</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With magic steeds. Thou from the fronting rim</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Bending to urge them, whilst thy sea-dark hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Falls in ambrosial ripples o’er each limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With beautiful pale arms, untrammelled, bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For horsemanship to those twin chargers fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dost give full reign across the fires that flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the wide floor of heaven, from off their feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Scattering the powdery star-dust as they go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Come swiftly down the sky, O Lady Night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Fall through the shadow-country, O most kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shake out thy strands of gentle dreams and light</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For chains, wherewith thou still art used to bind</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With tenderest love of careful leeches’ art</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The bruised and weary heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In slumber blind.</span>

			<p>
				<span>As of old Phoenician men, to the Tin Isles sailing</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Straight against the sunset and the edges of the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Chaunted loud above the storm and the strange sea’s wailing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Legends of their people and the land that gave them birth⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang aloud to Baal-Peor, sang unto the horned maiden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang how they should come again with the Brethon treasure laden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sang of all the pride and glory of their hardy enterprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How they found the outer islands, where the unknown stars arise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the rowers down below, rowing hard as they could row,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Toiling at the stroke and feather through the wet and wary weather,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Even they forgot their burden in the measure of a song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And the merchants and the masters and the bondsmen all together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dreaming of the wondrous islands, brought the gallant ship along;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So in mighty deeps alone on the chainless breezes blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In my oracle of verses I will sing of lands unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Flying from the scarlet city where a Lord that knows no pity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mocks the broken people praying round his iron throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>—Sing about the Hidden Country fresh and full of quiet green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing over seas uncharted to a port that none has seen.</span>
