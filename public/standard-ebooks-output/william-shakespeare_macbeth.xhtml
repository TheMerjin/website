									<br/>
									<span>A most miraculous work in this good king;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which often, since my here-remain in England,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The mere despair of surgery, he cures,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Put on with holy prayers: and ’tis spoken,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To the succeeding royalty he leaves</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And sundry blessings hang about his throne,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That speak him full of grace.</span>
