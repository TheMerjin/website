								<span>This waste of year-long vigil I have prayed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>God for some respite, watching elbow-stayed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As sleuthhounds watch, above the Atreidae’s hall,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till well I know yon midnight festival</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Of swarming stars, and them that lonely go,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Bearers to man of summer and of snow,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Great lords and shining, throned in heavenly fire.</span>

								<span>That bears Troy’s capture on a voice of flame</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Shouting o’erseas. So surely to her aim</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cleaveth a woman’s heart, man-passionèd!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And when I turn me to my bed⁠—my bed</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dew-drenched and dark and stumbling, to which near</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Cometh no dream nor sleep, but alway Fear</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Breathes round it, warning, lest an eye once fain</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To close may close too well to wake again;</span>
								<br/>

								<br/>
								<span>If verily, verily, Ilion’s citadel</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Is fallen, as yon beacons flaming tell.</span>

							<p>
								<span>And I myself will tread the dance before</span>

								<br/>
								<span>Good, and mine own to-night three sixes plain. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Lights begin to show in the Palace.</i></span>

								<br/>
								<span>I speak not. A great ox hath laid his weight</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Across my tongue. But these stone walls know well,</span>

								<span>If stones had speech, what tale were theirs to tell.</span>

					<p>The Watchman, like most characters in Greek tragedy, comes from the Homeric tradition, though in Homer (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem"><abbr>Od.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 524) he is merely a servant of Aigisthos. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-3" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Women’s triumph cry.⁠—This cry of the women recurs several times in the play: <abbr>cf.</abbr> <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-698">line</a>, <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1393">line</a>. It is conventionally represented by “ololû”; as the cry to Apollo, Paian is “I-ê,” <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-141">line</a>, and Cassandra’s sob is “ototoi” or “otototoi,” <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1221">line</a>. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-4" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>With this silent scene of Clytemnestra’s, compare the long silence of Cassandra below, and the silence of Prometheus in that play until his torturers have left him.

				</li>
				<li id="note-5" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Sign of the War-Way.⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> an ominous sign seen by the army as it started on its journey. In Homer, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i>, <abbr>ll.</abbr> 305⁠–⁠329, it is a snake which eats the nine young of a mother bird and then the mother, and is turned into stone afterwards.⁠—All through this chorus the language of the prophet Calchas is intentionally obscure and riddling⁠—the style of prophesy. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-6" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>But I-ê, i-ê.⁠—(Pronounce <em>Ee-ay</em>.) Calchas, catching sight in his vision of the further consequences which Artemis will exact if she fulfils the sign, calls on Apollo Paian, the Healer, to check her. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-6" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-7" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Zeus, whate’er He be.⁠—This conception of Zeus is expressed also in Aeschylus’ <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Suppliant Women</i>, and was probably developed in the Prometheus Trilogy. See my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rise of the Greek Epic</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 291 (<abbr>Ed.</abbr> 2).</p>
					<p>It is connected with the common Greek conception of the <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">Tritos Sôtêr</i>⁠—the Saviour Third. First, He who sins; next, He who avenges; third, He who saves. In vegetation worship it is the Old Year who has committed Hubris, the sin of pride, in summer; the Winter who slays him; the New Year which shall save. In mythology the three successive Rulers of Heaven are given by Hesiod as Ouranos, Kronos, Zeus (<abbr>cf.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Prometheus</i>, 965 <abbr>ff.</abbr>), but we cannot tell if Aeschylus accepted the Hesiodic story. <abbr>Cf.</abbr> <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11">note on <abbr>l.</abbr> 246</a>, and Clytemnestra’s blasphemy at <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1556">line</a>. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-7" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-9" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Artemis.⁠—Her name was terrible, because of its suggestion. She demanded the sacrifice of Agamemnon’s daughter, Iphigenia. (See Euripides’ two plays, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Iphigenia in Tauris</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Iphigenia in Aulis</i>.) In other poets Agamemnon has generally committed some definite sin against Artemis, but in Aeschylus the death of Iphigenia seems to be merely one of the results of his acceptance of the Sign. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-9" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-10" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>’Tis a Rite of old.⁠—Literally “it is Themis.” Human sacrifice had had a place in the primitive religion of Greece; hence Agamemnon could not reject the demand of the soldiers as an obvious crime. See <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rise of Greek Epic</i>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 150⁠–⁠157. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-10" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				</li>
				<li id="note-13" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Glad-voiced.⁠—Clytemnestra is in extreme suspense, as the return of Agamemnon will mean either her destruction or her deliverance. At such a moment there must be no ill-omened word, so she challenges fate. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-13" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-14" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>A word within that hovereth without wings.⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> a presentiment. “Winged words” are words spoken, which fly from speaker to hearer. A “wingless” word is unspoken. The phrase occurs in Homer. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-14" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-15" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Beacon Speech. There is no need to inquire curiously into the practical possibility of this chain of beacons. Greek tragedies do not care to be exact about this kind of detail. There may well have been a tradition that Agamemnon, like the Great King of Persia, used a chain of beacons across the Aegean.⁠—Note how vividly Clytemnestra’s imagination is working in her excitement. She seems to see before her every leaping light in the chain, just as in the next speech she imagines the scene in Troy almost with the intensity of a vision. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-15" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-16" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Victory in the first as in the last.⁠—All are Victory beacons; the spirit of Victory infects them all equally. <abbr>Cf.</abbr> <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-974">line</a>, where Agamemnon prays that the Victory which is now with him, or in him, may abide. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-16" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-17" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>A woman’s word.⁠—Her hatred and fear of Agamemnon, making her feel vividly the horrors of the sack and the peril overhanging the conquerors, have carried her dangerously far. She checks herself and apologizes for her womanlike anxiety. <abbr>Cf.</abbr> <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1880">line</a>. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-17" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-18" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Seers they saw visions.⁠—A difficult and uncertain passage. I think the seers attached to the royal household (<abbr>cf.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Libation-Bearers</i>, <abbr>l.</abbr> 37, where they are summoned to read a dream) were rather like what we call clairvoyants. Being consulted, they look into some pool of liquid or the like; there they see gradually emerging the palace, the injured King, the deserted room, and at last a wraith of Helen herself, haunting the place. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-18" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Agamemnon has committed all the sins she prayed against, and more. The terrible lines 527 <abbr>ff.</abbr>, “Till her Gods’ Houses, <abbr>etc.</abbr>,” are very like a passage in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Persae</i>, 811 <abbr>ff.</abbr>, where exactly the same acts by the Persian invaders of Greece make their future punishment inevitable. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-21" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Our women’s joy-cry.⁠—There seems to have been in Argos an old popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed death of a man and a woman. Homer (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem"><abbr>Od.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 309 <abbr>f.</abbr>) derives it from a rejoicing by Orestes over Aigisthos and Clytemnestra; <abbr>cf.</abbr> below, <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1486">line</a>; Aeschylus here and Sophocles in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Electra</i>, from a celebration by Clytemnestra of the deaths of Agamemnon and Cassandra. Probably it was really some ordinary New Year and Old Year celebration to which the poets give a tragic touch. It seems to have had a woman’s “Ololugmos” in it, perhaps uttered by men. See Kaibel’s note, <abbr>Soph.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Electra</i> 277⁠–⁠281. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-26" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-28" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Menelaus.⁠—This digression about Menelaus is due, as similar digressions generally are when they occur in Greek plays, to the poet feeling bound to follow the tradition. Homer begins his longest account of the slaying of Agamemnon by asking “Where was Menelaus?” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem"><abbr>Od.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 249).

				<li id="note-30" epub:type="endnote">
					<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Chorus</b>. The name <strong>Helena</strong>.⁠—There was a controversy in Aeschylus’ day whether language, including names, was a matter of Convention or of Nature. Was it mere accident, and could you change the name of anything at will? Or was language a thing rooted in nature and fixed by God from of old? Aeschylus adopts the latter view: Why was this being called Helena? If one had understood God’s purpose one would have seen it was because she really <em>was</em> “Helenâs”⁠—<em>Ship-destroyer</em>. (The Herald’s story of the shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) Similarly, if a hero was called Aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called from “Aiai,” “Alas!”⁠—The antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name Paris or Alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-30" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-31" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Entrance of Agamemnon. The metre of the Chorus indicates marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across the orchestra and get into position. Cassandra would be dressed, as a prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">agrênon</i>, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and certain fillets or crowns. The Leader welcomes the King: he explains that, though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his opinion, he is a faithful servant of the King⁠ ⁠… and that not all are equally so. He gave a similar hint to the Herald above, <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-660">lines</a>. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-31" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Agamemnon.⁠—A hard, cold speech, full of pride in the earlier part, and turning to ominous threats at the end. Those who have dared to be false shall be broken.⁠—At the end comes a note of fear, like the fear in Shakespeare’s Julius Caesar. He is so full of triumph and success; he must be very careful not to provoke a fall.⁠—Victory, Nike, was to the Greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. It clung to you or it deserted you. And one who was really charged with Victory, like Agamemnon, was very valuable to his friends and people. Hence they made statues of Victory wingless⁠—so that she should not fly away. See <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Four Stages of Greek Religion</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 138 note. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-32" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-33" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Clytemnestra.⁠—A wonderful speech. It seems to me that Aeschylus’ imagination realized all the confused passions in Clytemnestra’s mind, but that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and explicit. She is in suspense; does Agamemnon know her guilt or not? At least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse herself in the eyes of the world. A touch of hysteria creeps in; why could he not have been killed in all these years? Why must he rise, like some monster from the grave, unkillable? Gradually she recovers her calm, explains clearly the suspicious point of Orestes’ absence, and heaps up her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which Agamemnon rebukes, <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1043">line</a>). Again, at the end, when she finds that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-33" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
				</li>
				<li id="note-34" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>What is the motive of the Crimson Tapestries? I think the tangling robe must have been in the tradition, as the murder in the bath certainly was. One motive, of course, is obvious: Clytemnestra is tempting Agamemnon to sin or “go too far.” He tries to resist, but the splendour of an oriental homecoming seduces him and he yields. But is that enough to account for such a curious trait in the story, and one so strongly emphasized? We are told afterwards that Clytemnestra threw over her victim an “endless web,” long and rich (<a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1556">line</a>), to prevent his seeing or using his arms. And I cannot help suspecting that this endless web was the same as the crimson pall.</p>
					<p>If one tries to conjecture the origin of this curious story, it is perhaps a clue to realize that the word <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">droitê</i> means both a bath and a sarcophagus, or rather that the thing called droitê, a narrow stone or marble vessel about seven feet long, was in pre-classical and post-classical times used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly or solely as a bath. If among the prehistoric graves at Mycenae some later peasants discovered a royal mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in a robe of royal crimson, and showing signs of violent death⁠—such as Schliemann believed that he discovered⁠—would they not say: “We found the body of a King murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great robe?” <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-34" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-36" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Tell me but this.⁠—This little dialogue is very characteristic of Aeschylus. Euripides would have done it at three times the length and made all the points clear.

				<li id="note-38" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>This princess.⁠—This is the first time that the attention of the audience is drawn to Cassandra. She too is one of Aeschylus’ silent figures. I imagine her pale, staring in front of her, almost as if in a trance, until terror seizes her at Clytemnestra’s greeting in <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#agamemnon-span-1180">line</a>. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-38" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The cry.⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> the cry of the possessed prophetess which rang from the inner sanctuary at Delphi and was interpreted by the priests.⁠—The last two lines of the speech are plain in their meaning but hard to translate. Literally: “when the full, or fulfilled, man walketh his home⁠—O Zeus the Fulfiller, fulfil my prayers.” <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-39" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-40" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>The victim has been drawn into the house; the Chorus sing a low boding song: every audience at a Greek tragedy would expect next to hear a death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out. Instead of which the door opens and there is Clytemnestra: what does she want? “Come thou also!” One victim is not enough.⁠—In the next scene we must understand the cause of Clytemnestra’s impatience. If she stays too long outside, someone will warn Agamemnon; if she leaves Cassandra, she with her second sight will warn the Chorus. If Cassandra could only be got inside all would be safe! <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-40" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-44" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Thou show her.⁠—It seems odd to think that this passage has for centuries been translated as if it was all addressed to Cassandra: “But if you do not understand what I say, please indicate the same with your barbarous hand!”⁠—What makes Cassandra at last speak? I think that the Elder probably touches her, and the touch as it were breaks the spell. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-44" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-45" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Cassandra.⁠—“Otototoi” really takes the place of a stage direction: she utters a long low sob.⁠—The exclamation which I have translated “Dreams!” seems to occur when people see ghosts or visions. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Alcestis</i>, 261; <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Prometheus</i>, 567. <abbr>Cf.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Phoenissae</i> 1296.⁠—“Mine enemy!” The name “Apollon” suggested “<i xml:lang="grc-Latn">apollyon</i>,” Destroying⁠ ⁠… the form which is actually used in the Book of Revelation (<abbr>Rev.</abbr> 9:11).</p>
					<p>Observe how, during the lyric scene, Cassandra’s vision grows steadily more definite: First vague horror of the House: then the sobbing of children, slain long ago: then, a new deed of blood coming; a woman in it: a wife: then, with a great effort, an attempt to describe the actual slaying in the bath. Lastly, the sight of herself among the slain. (This last point is greatly developed by Euripides, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Trojan Women</i>, <abbr>ll.</abbr> 445 <abbr>ff.</abbr>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 33 <abbr>f.</abbr>).</p>
					<p>The story of the Children of Thyestes is given below, <abbr>ll.</abbr> 1590 <abbr>ff.</abbr>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 73. Procnê (or Philomêla) was an Attic princess who, in fury against her Thracian husband, Tereus, killed their child Itys, or Itylus, and was changed into a nightingale, to weep for him forever. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-45" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

				<li id="note-46" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>Dialogue. During the lyrics Cassandra has been “possessed” or “entranced”: the turn to dialogue marks a conscious attempt to control herself and state plainly her message of warning. In order to prove her power, she first tells the Elders of deeds done in the past which are known to them but cannot have been known to her. When once they are convinced of her true seercraft, she will be able to warn them of what is coming!⁠—The short “stichomythia” (line for line dialogue), dealing in awed whispers with things which can hardly be spoken, leaves the story of Cassandra still a mystery. Then her self-control breaks and the power of the God sweeps irresistibly upon her; <abbr>cf.</abbr> below, <abbr>ll.</abbr> 1256 <abbr>ff.</abbr>; where it comes at her like a visible shape of fire, a thing not uncommon with modern clairvoyants. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-46" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The death cry; the hesitation of the Elders.⁠—This scene is often condemned or even ridiculed; I think, through misunderstanding. We knew the Old Men were helpless, like “dreams wandering in the day.” It is essential to the story that when the crisis comes they shall be found wanting. But they are neither foolish nor cowardly; each utterance in itself is natural and characteristic, but counsels are divided. One would like to know whether Aeschylus made them speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on the modern stage, or whether the stately conventions of Greek tragedy preferred that each speaker should finish his say. In any case, what happens is that after a moment or two of confused counsel the Elders determine to break into the Palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open and Clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of Agamemnon and Cassandra.</p>
					<p>The illusion intended is that the Elders have entered the Palace and discovered Clytemnestra. But, as the mechanical arrangements of the Greek stage were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it would, even with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a slight confusion or inconsistency is allowed. We are supposed to be inside the house; but as a matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and the play goes on without any attention to the particular place of the action.

				<li id="note-50" epub:type="endnote">
					<p>A prayer well sped to Zeus of Hell⁠—As the third gift or libation was ritually given to Zeus the Saviour, Clytemnestra blasphemously suggests that her third and unnecessary blow was an acceptable gift to a sort of anti-Zeus, a Saviour of Death. <a href="agamemnon.xhtml#noteref-50" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><b epub:type="z3998:persona">Aigisthos</b>.⁠—The entry of Aigisthos enlivens the scene again after the brooding and bewildered end of the dialogue between Clytemnestra and the Elders.

			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface</h2>
			<p>The sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar approaches the task of translating the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> depends directly on its greatness as poetry. It is in part a matter of diction. The language of Aeschylus is an extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the vocabulary obscure, unexpected, and steeped in splendour. Its peculiarities cannot be disregarded, or the translation will be false in character. Yet not Milton himself could produce in English the same great music, and a translator who should strive ambitiously to represent the complex effect of the original would clog his own powers of expression and strain his instrument to breaking. But, apart from the diction in this narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> which seems almost to defy reproduction in another setting, because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the historical development of Greek literature.</p>
			<p>If we accept the view that all Art to some extent, and Greek tragedy in a very special degree, moves in its course of development from Religion to Entertainment, from a Service to a Performance, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> seems to stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near perfection. The drama has come fully to life, but the religion has not yet faded to a formality. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> is not, like Aeschylus’ <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Suppliant Women</i>, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. It is a real play, showing clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological depth and subtlety. Yet it still remains something more than a play. Its atmosphere is not quite of this world. In the long lyrics especially one feels that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer’s wish to thrill an audience, not even perhaps the pure artist’s wish to create beauty, but something deeper and more prophetic, a passionate contemplation and expression of truth; though of course the truth in question is something felt rather than stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and majestic rhythm like the movement of the stars.</p>
			<p>Thus, if Longinus is right in defining Sublimity as “the ring, or resonance, of greatness of soul,” one sees in part where the sublimity of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> comes from. And it is worth noting that the faults which some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion. For the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and utterly refuses to tolerate others. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> may be slow in getting to work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. It never approaches to being cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. It never ceases to be genuinely a “criticism of life.” The theme which it treats, for instance, is a great theme in its own right; it is not a made-up story ingeniously handled.</p>
			<p>The trilogy of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Oresteia</i>, of which this play is the first part, centres on the old and everlastingly unsolved problem of</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>The ancient blinded vengeance and the wrong that amendeth wrong.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Every wrong is justly punished; yet, as the world goes, every punishment becomes a new wrong, calling for fresh vengeance. And more; every wrong turns out to be itself rooted in some wrong of old. It is never gratuitous, never untempted by the working of Peitho (Persuasion), never merely wicked. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Oresteia</i> first shows the cycle of crime punished by crime which must be repunished, and then seeks for some gleam of escape, some breaking of the endless chain of “evil duty.” In the old order of earth and heaven there was no such escape. Each blow called for the return blow and must do so <i xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</i>. But, according to Aeschylus, there is a new Ruler now in heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and thereby grown wise. He is Zeus the Third Power, Zeus the Saviour, and his gift to mankind is the ability through suffering to Learn (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 7 <abbr>f.</abbr>)</p>
			<p>At the opening of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Agamemnon</i> we find Clytemnestra alienated from her husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, Aigisthos. The air is heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due cause. Agamemnon, obeying the prophet Calchas, when the fleet lay storm-bound at Aulis, had given his own daughter, Iphigenia, as a human sacrifice. And if we ask how a sane man had consented to such an act, we are told of his gradual temptation; the deadly excuse offered by ancient superstition; and above all, the fact that he had already inwardly accepted the great whole of which this horror was a part. At the first outset of his expedition against Troy there had appeared an omen, the bloody sign of two eagles devouring a mother-hare with her unborn young.⁠ ⁠… The question was thus put to the Kings and their prophet: Did they or did they not accept the sign, and wish to be those Eagles? And they had answered Yes. They would have their vengeance, their full and extreme victory, and were ready to pay the price. The sign once accepted, the prophet recoils from the consequences which, in prophetic vision, he sees following therefrom: but the decision has been taken, and the long tale of cruelty rolls on, culminating in the triumphant sack of Troy, which itself becomes not an assertion of Justice but a whirlwind of godless destruction. And through all these doings of fierce beasts and angry men the unseen Pity has been alive and watching, the Artemis who “abhors the Eagles’ feast,” the “Apollo or Pan or Zeus” who hears the crying of the robbed vulture; nay, if even the Gods were deaf, the mere “wrong of the dead” at Troy might waken, groping for some retribution upon the “Slayer of Many Men” (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 15, 20).</p>
			<p id="preface-p-8">If we ask why men are so blind, seeking their welfare thus through incessant evil, Aeschylus will tell us that the cause lies in the infection of old sin, old cruelty. There is no doubt somewhere a <i xml:lang="grc">πρώταρχος Ἄτη</i>, a “first blind deed of wrong,” but in practice every wrong is the result of another. And the Children of Atreus are steeped to the lips in them. When the prophetess Cassandra, out of her first vague horror at the evil House, begins to grope towards some definite image, first and most haunting comes the sound of the weeping of two little children, murdered long ago, in a feud that was not theirs. From that point, more than any other, the Daemon or Genius of the House⁠—more than its “Luck,” a little less than its Guardian Angel⁠—becomes an Alastor or embodied Curse, a “Red Slayer” which cries ever for peace and cleansing, but can seek them only in the same blind way, through vengeance, and, when that fails, then through more vengeance (<abbr>p.</abbr> 69).</p>
			<p>This awful conception of a race intent upon its own wrongs, and blindly groping towards the very terror it is trying to avoid, is typified, as it were, in the Cassandra story. That daughter of Priam was beloved by Apollo, who gave her the power of true prophecy. In some way that we know not, she broke her promise to the God; and, since his gift could not be recalled, he added to it the curse that, while she should always foresee and foretell the truth, none should believe her. The Cassandra scene is a creation beyond praise or criticism. The old scholiast speaks of the “pity and amazement” which it causes. The Elders who talk with her wish to believe, they try to understand, they are really convinced of Cassandra’s powers. But the curse is too strong. The special thing which Cassandra tries again and again to say always eludes them, and they can raise no finger to prevent the disaster happening. And when it does happen they are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, “dreams wandering in the daylight.”</p>
			<p>The characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further significance which is almost symbolic. Cassandra is, as it were, the incarnation of that knowledge which Herodotus describes as the crown of sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Hdt.</abbr></i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 16). Agamemnon himself, the King of Kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol of pride and the fall of pride. We must not think of him as bad or specially cruel. The watchman loved him (<abbr>ll.</abbr> 34 <abbr>f.</abbr>), and the lamentations of the Elders over his death have a note of personal affection (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 66 <abbr>ff.</abbr>). But I suspect that Aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of names, took the name Agamemnon to be a warning that <i xml:lang="grc">Ἄγα μίμνει</i>, “the unseen Wrath abides.” <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">Agâ</i>, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is more like Nemesis, the feeling that something is <i xml:lang="grc">ἄγαν</i>, “too much,” the condemnation of <em>Hubris</em> (pride or overgrowth) and of all things that are in excess. <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">Agâ</i> is sometimes called “the jealousy of God,” but such a translation is not happy. It is not the jealousy, nor even the indignation, of a personal God, but the profound repudiation and reversal of Hubris which is the very law of the Cosmos. Through all the triumph of the conqueror, this <i xml:lang="grc-Latn">Agâ</i> abides.</p>
			<p>The greatest and most human character of the whole play is Clytemnestra. She is conceived on the grand Aeschylean scale, a scale which makes even Lady Macbeth and Beatrice Cenci seem small; she is more the kinswoman of Brynhild. Yet she is full not only of character, but of subtle psychology. She is the first and leading example of that time-honoured ornament of the tragic stage, the sympathetic, or semi-sympathetic, heroine-criminal. Aeschylus employs none of the devices of later playwrights to make her interesting. He admits, of course, no approach to a love-scene; he uses no sophisms; but he does make us see through Clytemnestra’s eyes and feel through her passions. The agony of silent prayer in which, if my conception is right, we first see her, helps to interpret her speeches when they come; but every speech needs close study. She dare not speak sincerely or show her real feelings until Agamemnon is dead; and then she is practically a mad woman.</p>
			<p id="preface-p-12">For I think here that there is a point which has not been observed. It is that Clytemnestra is conceived as being really “possessed” by the Daemon of the House when she commits her crime. Her statements on <abbr>p.</abbr> 69 are not empty metaphor. A careful study of the scene after the murder will show that she appears first “possessed” and almost insane with triumph, utterly dominating the Elders and leaving them no power to answer. Then gradually the unnatural force dies out from her. The deed that was first an ecstasy of delight becomes an “affliction” (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 72, 76). The strength that defied the world flags and changes into a longing for peace. She has done her work. She has purified the House of its madness; now let her go away and live out her life in quiet. When Aigisthos appears, and the scene suddenly becomes filled with the wrangling of common men, Clytemnestra fades into a long silence, from which she only emerges at the very end of the drama to pray again for Peace, and, strangest of all, to utter the entreaty: “Let us not stain ourselves with blood!” The splash of her husband’s blood was visible on her face at the time. Had she in her trance-like state actually forgotten, or did she, even then, not feel that particular blood to be a stain?</p>
			<p>To some readers it will seem a sort of irrelevance, or at least a blurring of the dramatic edge of this tragedy, to observe that the theme on which it is founded was itself the central theme both of Greek Tragedy and of Greek Religion. The fall of Pride, the avenging of wrong by wrong, is no new subject selected by Aeschylus. It forms both the commonest burden of the moralising lyrics in Greek tragedy and even of the tragic myths themselves; and recent writers have shown how the same idea touches the very heart of the traditional Greek religion. “The life of the Year-Daemon, who lies at the root of so many Greek gods and heroes, is normally a story of Pride and Punishment. Each year arrives, waxes great, commits the sin of Hubris and must therefore die. It is the way of all Life.” As an early philosopher expresses it, “All things pay retribution for their injustice one to another according to the ordinance of Time.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></p>
			<p>To me this consideration actually increases the interest and beauty of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Oresteia</i>, because it increases its greatness. The majestic art, the creative genius, the instinctive eloquence of these plays⁠—that eloquence which is the mere despair of a translator⁠—are all devoted to the expression of something which Aeschylus felt to be of tremendous import. It was not his discovery; but it was a truth of which he had an intense realization. It had become something which he must with all his strength bring to expression before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or of argument, like a discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and greater than himself, in the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.</p>
