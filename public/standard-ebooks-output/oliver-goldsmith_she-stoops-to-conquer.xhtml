			<p>Dear Sir,</p>
			<p>By inscribing this slight performance to you, I do not mean so much to compliment you as myself. It may do me some honour to inform the public, that I have lived many years in intimacy with you. It may serve the interests of mankind also to inform them, that the greatest wit may be found in a character, without impairing the most unaffected piety.</p>
			<p>I have, particularly, reason to thank you for your partiality to this performance. The undertaking a comedy not merely sentimental was very dangerous; and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Colman, who saw this piece in its various stages, always thought it so. However, I ventured to trust it to the public; and, though it was necessarily delayed till late in the season, I have every reason to be grateful.</p>
			<footer>
				<p>
					<span>I am, dear sir,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your most sincere friend</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And admirer,</span>

								<span>Well, having stooped to conquer with success,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And gained a husband without aid from dress,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Still, as a barmaid, I could wish it too,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>As I have conquered him to conquer you:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And let me say, for all your resolution.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That pretty barmaids have done execution.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Our life is all a play, composed to please;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“We have our exits and our entrances.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The first act shows the simple country maid,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Harmless and young, of everything afraid;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Blushes when hired, and with unmeaning action,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>“I hopes as how to give you satisfaction.”</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Her second act displays a livelier scene⁠—</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Th’ unblushing barmaid of a country inn,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Who whisks about the house, at market caters.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Talks loud, coquettes the guests, and scolds the waiters.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Next the scene shifts to town, and there she soars,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The chophouse toast of ogling connoisseurs.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>On Squires and Cits she there displays her arts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And on the gridiron broils her lovers’ hearts;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And, as she smiles, her triumphs to complete,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>E’en common councilmen forget to eat.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fourth act shows her wedded to the Squire,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Madam now begins to hold it higher;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pretends to taste, at Operas cries <i xml:lang="it">caro</i>!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And quits her Nancy Dawson for <i xml:lang="it">Che Faro</i>:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dotes upon dancing, and in all her pride.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Swims round the room, the Heinel of Cheapside;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Ogles and leers, with artificial skill,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Till, having lost in age the power to kill.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>She sits all night at cards, and ogles at spadille.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Such, through our lives, th’ eventful history!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fifth and last act still remains for me:</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The barmaid now for your protection prays,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Turns female barrister, and pleads for Bayes.</span>

								<span>Excuse me, sirs, I pray⁠—I can’t yet speak⁠—</span>

								<span>I’m crying now⁠—and have been all the week!</span>

								<span>I am undone, that’s all⁠—shall lose my bread⁠—</span>

								<span>I’d rather, but that’s nothing⁠—lose my head.</span>

								<span>When the sweet maid is laid upon the bier,</span>

								<span>Shuter and I shall be chief mourners here.</span>

								<br/>
								<span>With a sententious look, that nothing means,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>(Faces are blocks in sentimental scenes),</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Thus I begin⁠—“All is not gold that glitters,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Pleasure seems sweet, but proves a glass of bitters.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>When Ignorance enters, Folly is at hand;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Learning is better far than house and land.</span>
