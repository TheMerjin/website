									<span>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sans check to good and bad: but when the planets</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The unity and married calm of states</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The primogenitive and due of birth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Take but degree away, untune that string,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then every thing includes itself in power,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Power into will, will into appetite;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And appetite, an universal wolf,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>So doubly seconded with will and power,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Must make perforce an universal prey,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Follows the choking.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And this neglection of degree it is</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It hath to climb. The general’s disdain’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By him one step below, he by the next,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That next by him beneath; so every step,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And ’tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</span>

									<span>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</span>

								<span>In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Fraught with the ministers and instruments</span>

								<span>Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The ravish’d Helen, Menelaus’ queen,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>With wanton Paris sleeps; and that’s the quarrel.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>To Tenedos they come;</span>

								<span>And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains</span>
								<br/>
								<span>The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Their brave pavilions: Priam’s six-gated city,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And Antenorides, with massy staples</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sperr up the sons of Troy.</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,</span>

								<span>On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come</span>
