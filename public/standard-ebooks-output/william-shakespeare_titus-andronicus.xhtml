									<br/>
									<span>My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The forest walks are wide and spacious;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And many unfrequented plots there are</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Single you thither then this dainty doe,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And strike her home by force, if not by words:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To villany and vengeance consecrate,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Will we acquaint with all that we intend;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And she shall file our engines with advice,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That will not suffer you to square yourselves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But to your wishes’ height advance you both.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The emperor’s court is like the house of Fame,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take your turns;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There serve your lusts, shadow’d from heaven’s eye,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And revel in Lavinia’s treasury.</span>

									<span>O, had the monster seen those lily hands</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He would not then have touch’d them for his life!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which that sweet tongue hath made,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He would have dropp’d his knife, and fell asleep</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As Cerberus at the Thracian poet’s feet.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For such a sight will blind a father’s eye:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>One hour’s storm will drown the fragrant meads;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What will whole months of tears thy father’s eyes?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, could our mourning ease thy misery! <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exeunt.</i></span>
