Door <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L.</abbr> down Left. On the Left wall large maps showing steamship and railroad routes. On the Right wall are fastened printed placards.

There is a leather couch with arms Right Center. At the extreme Right an armchair. At extreme Left a chair. There is also a chair in front of <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Domin’s</b> desk. Two green cabinets across the upstage corners of the room complete the furniture. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Domin’s</b> desk is placed up and down stage facing Right.</i>

				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Seen through the windows which run to the heights of the room are rows of factory chimneys, telegraph poles and wires. There is a general passageway or hallway upstage at the Right Center which leads to the warehouse. The <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Robots</b> are brought into the office through this entrance.</i>

The skeleton framework of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> is still used. Tall windows put in back instead of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> windows.

Where the green cabinet of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> at Left has stood is a door, <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L. 2</abbr>, leading to the outside. Where the cabinet stood at Right, a fireplace is placed. The tall open hallway <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">R. C.</abbr> of Act <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> is blocked up with a flat piece. The doors at Right and Left 1 have been changed to those of a drawing room. Door at Right leads to <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Helena’s</b> bedroom. Door at Left 1 leads to library.</i></p>
			<p>
				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The furniture consists of a reading table at Left Center covered with magazines. A chair to the Left of table. In front of table is an armchair covered in chintz. A couch Right Center and back of it is a small table with books and bookends. On this table a small reading lamp. At Right between doorway and fireplace is a small table. There is a workbasket upon it, with pincushion, needles, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> Down stage at Right and facing the couch is another armchair used by <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Alquist</b>. To the Left of fireplace is a straight-backed chair. Upstage at Left near the <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L. 2</abbr> door to the outside is a writing desk. There is a lamp upon it, writing paper, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, a telephone and binoculars.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">The walls of the room have been covered with silk to the height of seven feet. This is done in small flats to fit the different spaces and are in place against the permanent set. The two French windows open into the room. At the rise they are open. There is a balcony beyond looking over the harbor. The same telegraph wires and poles from Act I are again visible through the window. The windows are trimmed with gray lace curtains. Binoculars on desk up stage by television.</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				<i class="scene-description" epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">It is about nine in the morning and <b>sunlight</b> streams into the room through the open windows. <b epub:type="z3998:persona">Domin</b> opens the door <abbr epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">L. 2</abbr>; tiptoes in.
