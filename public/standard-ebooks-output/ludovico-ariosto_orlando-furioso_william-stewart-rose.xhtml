					<span>Angelica, whom pressing danger frights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flies in disorder through the greenwood shade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s horse escapes: he, following, fights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ferraù, the Spaniard, in a forest glade.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A second oath the haughty paynim plights,</span>

				<span>Of loves and ladies, knights and arms, I sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of courtesies, and many a daring feat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from those ancient days my story bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Moors from Afric passed in hostile fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ravaged France, with Agramant their king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flushed with his youthful rage and furious heat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on king Charles’, the Roman emperor’s, head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had vowed due vengeance for Troyano dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the same strain of Roland<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> will I tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom strange madness and rank fury fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A man esteemed so wise in former time;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she, who to like cruel pass has well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh brought my feeble wit which fain would climb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hourly wastes my sense, concede me skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strength my daring promise to fulfil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Good seed of Hercules,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a> give ear and deign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou that this age’s grace and splendour art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippolitus, to smile upon his pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who tenders what he has with humble heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For though all hope to quit the score were vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My pen and pages may pay the debt in part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, with no jealous eye my offering scan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor scorn my gifts who give thee all I can.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And me, amid the worthiest shalt thou hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom I with fitting praise prepare to grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Record the good Rogero,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> valiant peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ancient root of thine illustrious race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him, if thou wilt lend a willing ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The worth and warlike feats I shall retrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So thou thy graver cares some little time</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Postponing, lend thy leisure to my rhyme.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Roland, who long the lady of Catày,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, had loved, and with his brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised countless trophies to that damsel gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In India, Median, and Tartarian land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Westward with her had measured back his way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, nigh the Pyrenees, with many a band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Germany and France, King Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had camped his faithful host upon the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To make King Agramant, for penance, smite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cheek, and rash Marsilius rue the hour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em>, when all trained with lance and sword to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He led from Africa to swell his power;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That other</em> when he pushed, in fell despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the realm of France Spain’s martial flower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas thus Orlando came where Charles was tented</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In evil hour, and soon the deed repented.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For here was seized his dame of peerless charms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(How often human judgment wanders wide)!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom in long warfare he had kept from harms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From western climes to eastern shores her guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his own land, ’mid friends and kindred arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now without contest severed from his side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing the mischief kindled by her eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him the prudent emperor reft the prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For bold Orlando and his cousin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo late contended for the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enamoured of that beauty rare; since she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike the glowing breast of either swayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Charles, who little liked such rivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drew an omen thence of feebler aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To abate the cause of quarrel, seized the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And placed her in Bavarian Namus’ care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Vowing with her the warrior to content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in that conflict, on that fatal day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his good hand most gainful succour lent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And slew most paynims in the martial fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But counter to his hopes the battle went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his thinned squadrons fled in disarray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Namus, with other Christian captains taken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his pavilion in the rout forsaken.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There, lodged by Charles, that gentle bonnibel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ordained to be the valiant victor’s meed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the event had sprung into her sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the combat turned in time of need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Presaging wisely Fortune would rebel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fatal day against the Christian creed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, entering a thick wood, discovered near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a close path, a horseless cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With shield upon his arm, in knightly wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Belted and mailed, his helmet on his head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight more lightly through the forest hies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than half-clothed churl to win the cloth of red.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not from cruel snake more swiftly flies<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The timid shepherdess, with startled tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than poor Angelica the bridle turns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she the approaching knight on foot discerns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was that Paladin, good Aymon’s seed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who Mount Albano had in his command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And late Bayardo lost, his gallant steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Escaped by strange adventure from his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as seen, the maid who rode at speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior knew, and, while yet distant, scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The angelic features and the gentle air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which long had held him fast in Cupid’s snare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The affrighted damsel turns her palfrey round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shakes the floating bridle in the wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in her panic seeks to choose her ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor open grove prefers to thicket blind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But reckless, pale and trembling, and astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaves to her horse the devious way to find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He up and down the forest bore the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till to a sylvan river’s bank he came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here stood the fierce Ferraù<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a> in grisly plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begrimed with dust, and bathed with sweat and blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lately had withdrawn him from the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rest and drink at that refreshing flood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But there had tarried in his own despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since bending from the bank, in hasty mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He dropped his helmet in the crystal tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly to regain the treasure tried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither at speed she drives, and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her wild panic utters fearful cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the voice, upleaping on the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Saracen her lovely visage spies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, pale as is her cheek, and troubled sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arriving, quickly to the warrior’s eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Though many days no news of her had shown)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beautiful Angelica is known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Courteous, and haply gifted with a breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As warm as either of the cousins two;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As bold, as if his brows in steel were dressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The succour which she sought he lent, and drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His faulchion, and against Rinaldo pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who saw with little fear the champion true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only each to each was known by sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But each had proved in arms his foeman’s might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus, as they are, on foot the warriors vie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In cruel strife, and blade to blade oppose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No marvel plate or brittle mail should fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When anvils had not stood the deafening blows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It now behoves the palfrey swift to ply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His feet; for while the knights in combat close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him vexed to utmost speed, with goading spurs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By waste or wood the frighted damsel stirs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the two had struggled long to throw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each other in the strife, and vainly still;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since neither valiant warrior was below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His opposite in force and knightly skill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first to parley with his Spanish foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the good master of Albano’s hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As one within whose raging breast was pent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A reckless fire which struggled for a vent).</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou think’st,” he said, “to injure me alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But know thou wilt thyself as much molest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if we fight because yon rising sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This raging heat has kindled in thy breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What were thy gain, and what the guerdon won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I should yield my life, or stoop my crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she shall never be thy glorious meed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who flies, while vainly we in battle bleed?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then how much better, since our stake’s the same,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou, loving like myself, should’st mount and stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wait this battle’s end, the lovely dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before she fly yet further on her way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady taken, we repeat our claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With naked faulchion to that peerless prey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Else by long toil I see not what we gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But simple loss and unrequited pain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The peer’s proposal pleased the paynim well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so their hot contention was foregone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such fair truce replaced that discord fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So mutual wrongs forgot and mischief done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for departure seated in his sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On foot the Spaniard left not Aymon’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him to mount his courser’s crupper prayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both united chased the royal maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! goodly truth in cavaliers of old!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rivals they were, to different faith were bred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not yet the weary warriors’ wounds were cold⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still smarting from those strokes so fell and dread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet they together ride by waste and wold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, unsuspecting, devious dingle thread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them, while four spurs infest his foaming sides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their courser brings to where the way divides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the warlike pair at fault, for they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew not by which she might her palfrey goad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Since both, without distinction, there survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The recent print of hoofs on either road),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Commit the chase to fortune. By this way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim pricked, by that Rinaldo strode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fierce Ferraù, bewildered in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found himself once again where late he stood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beside the water, where he stoop’d to drink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dropt the knightly helmet⁠—to his cost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sunk in the stream; and since he could not think</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to retrieve, who late his hopes had crossed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, where the treasure fell, descends the brink</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that swift stream, and seeks the morion lost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the casque lies so bedded in the sands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twill ask no light endeavour at his hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A bough he severs from a neighbouring tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shreds and shapes the branch into a pole:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this he sounds the stream, and anxiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fathoms, and rakes, and ransacks shelf and hole.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While angered sore at heart, and restless, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So lingered, where the troubled waters roll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breast-high, from the mid river rose upright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The apparition of an angry knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Armed at all points he was, except his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in his better hand a helmet bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The very casque, which in the river’s bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù sought vainly, toiling long and sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the Spanish knight he frowned, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thou traitor to thy word, thou perjured Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why grieve the goodly helmet to resign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, due to me long since, is justly mine?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Remember, pagan, when thine arm laid low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brother of Angelica.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a> That knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am I;⁠—thy word was plighted then to throw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After my other arms his helmet bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Fortune now compel thee to forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prize, and do my will in thy despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grieve not at this, but rather grieve that thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Art found a perjured traitor to thy vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But if thou seek’st a helmet, be thy task</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To win and wear it more to thy renown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A noble prize were good Orlando’s casque;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s such, or yet a fairer crown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almontes’, or Mambrino’s iron masque:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make one of these, by force of arms, thine own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this good helm will fitly be bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where (such thy promise) it has long been owed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bristled the paynim’s every hair at view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that grim shade, uprising from the tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vanished was his fresh and healthful hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While on his lips the half-formed accents died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next hearing Argalìa, whom he slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was the warrior hight) that stream beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus his unknightly breach of promise blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He burned all over, flushed with rage and shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor having time his falsehood to excuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knowing well how true the phantom’s lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood speechless; such remorse the words infuse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then by Lanfusa’s life the warrior swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never in fight, or foray would he use</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Helmet but that which good Orlando bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Aspramont, where bold Almontes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a> paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His life a forfeit to the Christian blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this new vow discharged more faithfully</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the vain promise which was whilom plight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the stream departing heavily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was many days sore vexed and grieved in sprite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still intent to seek Orlando, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roved wheresoe’er he hoped to find the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A different lot befell Rinaldo; who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had chanced another pathway to pursue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For far the warrior fared not, ere he spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bounding across the path, his gallant steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, “Stay, Bayardo mine,” Rinaldo cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Too cruel care the loss of thee does breed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horse for this returned not to his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deaf to his prayer, but flew with better speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Furious, in chase of him, Rinaldo hies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But follow we Angelica, who flies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through dreary woods and dark the damsel fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By rude unharboured heath and savage height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While every leaf or spray that rustled, bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Of oak, or elm, or beech), such new affright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She here and there her foaming palfrey sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By strange and crooked paths with furious flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at each shadow, seen in valley blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or mountain, feared Rinaldo was behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As a young roe or fawn of fallow deer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, mid the shelter of its native glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has seen a hungry pard or tiger tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bosom of its bleeding dam, dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bounds, through the forest green in ceaseless fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the destroying beast, from shade to shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at each sapling touched, amid its pangs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believes itself between the monster’s fangs,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One day and night, and half the following day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel wanders wide, nor whither knows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then enters a deep wood, whose branches play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved lightly by the freshening breeze which blows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through this two clear and murmuring rivers stray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon their banks a fresher herbage grows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the twin streams their passage slowly clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make music with the stones, and please the ear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Weening removed the way by which she wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand miles from loathed Rinaldo’s beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rest herself a while the maid intends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wearied with that long flight and summer’s heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from her saddle ’mid spring flowers descends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And takes the bridle from her courser fleet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loose along the river lets him pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roving the banks in search of lusty grass.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behold! at hand a thicket she surveys</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gay with the flowering thorn and vermeil rose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tuft reflected in the stream which strays</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside it, overshadowing oaks enclose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hollow within, and safe from vulgar gaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed a place constructed for repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With bows so interwoven, that the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pierced not the tangled screen, far less the sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within soft moss and herbage form a bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to delay and rest the traveller woo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas there her limbs the weary damsel spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her eyeballs bathed in slumber’s balmy dew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But little time had eased her drooping head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere, as she weened, a courser’s tramp she knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Softly she rises, and the river near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed cap-à-piè, beholds a cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If friend or foe, she nothing comprehends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So hope and fear her doubting bosom tear)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that adventure’s issue mute attends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even with a sigh disturbs the air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier upon the bank descends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sits so motionless, so lost in care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(His visage propt upon his arm) to sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changed into senseless stone appeared the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pensive, above an hour, with drooping head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rested mute, ere he began his moan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then his piteous tale of sorrow said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamenting in so soft and sweet a tone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in a tiger’s breast had pity bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or with his mournful wailings rent a stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so he sighed and wept; like rivers flowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His tears, his bosom like an Aetna glowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thought which now makes me burn, now freeze with hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which gnaws my heart and rankles at its root!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What’s left to me,” he said, “arrived too late,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While one more favoured bears away the fruit?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bare words and looks scarce cheered my hopeless state,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the prime spoils reward another’s suit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then since for me nor fruit nor blossom hangs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why should I longer pine in hopeless pangs?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The virgin has her image in the rose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sheltered in garden on its native stock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which there in solitude and safe repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blooms unapproached by sheperd or by flock.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this earth teems, and freshening water flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And breeze and dewy dawn their sweets unlock:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such the wistful youth his bosom dresses.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such the enamoured damsel braids her tresses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But wanton hands no sooner this displace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the maternal stem, where it was grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all is withered; whatsoever grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It found with man or heaven; bloom, beauty, gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel who should hold in higher place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than light or life the flower which is her own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffering the spoiler’s hand to crop the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forfeits her worth in every other’s eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And be she cheap with all except the wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom she did so large a boon bestow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! false and cruel Fortune! foul despite!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While others triumph, I am drown’d in woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And can it be that I such treasure slight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And can I then my very life forego?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No! let me die; ’twere happiness above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A longer life, if I must cease to love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If any ask who made this sorrowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pour’d into the stream so many tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I answer, it was fair Circassia’s king,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Sacripant, oppressed with amorous cares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love is the source from which his troubles spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sole occasion of his pains and fears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he to her a lover’s service paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now well remembered by the royal maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He for her sake from Orient’s farthest reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roved thither, where the sun descends to rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he was told in India, to his pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she Orlando followed to the west.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He after learned in France that Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secluded from that champion and the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As a fit guerdon, mewed her for the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who should protect the lilies best in fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warrior in the field had been, and viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short time before, king Charlemagne’s disgrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly had Angelica pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor of the damsel’s footsteps found a trace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this is what the weeping monarch rued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this he so bewailed in doleful case:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, into words his lamentations run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which might for pity stop the passing sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Sacripant laments him in this plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes a tepid fountain of his eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, what I deem not needful to recite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pours forth yet other plaints and piteous cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Propitious Fortune will his lady bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should hear the youth lament him in such wise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus a moment compassed what, without</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such chance, long ages had not brought about.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With deep attention, while the warrior weeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She marks the fashion of the grief and tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And words of him, whose passion never sleeps;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this the first confession which she hears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with his plaint her heart no measure keeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cold as the column which the builder rears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like haughty maid, who holds herself above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The world, and deems none worthy of her love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But her from harm amid those woods to keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel weened she might his guidance need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the poor drowning caitiff, who, chin-deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Implores not help, is obstinate indeed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will she, if she let the occasion sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Find escort that will stand her in such stead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she that king by long experience knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above all other lovers, kind and true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But not the more for this the maid intends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To heal the mischief which her charms had wrought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for past ills to furnish glad amends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that full bliss by pining lover sought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To keep the king in play are all her ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His help by some device or fiction bought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having to her purpose taxed his daring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To reassume as wont her haughty bearing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An apparition bright and unforeseen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She stood like Venus or Diana fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In solemn pageant, issuing on the scene</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From out of shadowy wood or murky lair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And “Peace be with you,” cried the youthful queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And God preserve my honour in his care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor suffer that you blindly entertain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opinion of my fame so false and vain!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not with such wonderment a mother eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such excessive bliss the son she mourned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As dead, lamented still with tears and sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since the thinned files without her boy returned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Not such her rapture as the king’s surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ecstasy of joy when he discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lofty presence, cheeks of heavenly hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lovely form which broke upon his view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, full of fond and eager passion, pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards his Lady, his Divinity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she now clasped the warrior to her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in Catày had haply been less free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now again the maid her thoughts addressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards her native land and empery:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And feels, with hope revived, her bosom beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shortly to repossess her sumptuous seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her chances all to him the damsel said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he was eastward sent to Sericane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her to seek the martial monarch’s aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who swayed the sceptre of that fair domain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told how oft Orlando’s friendly blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had saved her from dishonour, death, and pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how she so preserved her virgin flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pure as it blossomed in her natal hour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Haply the tale was true; yet will not seem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Likely to one of sober sense possessed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Sacripant, who waked from worser dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all without a cavil acquiesced:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Love, who sees without one guiding gleam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spies in broad day but that which likes him best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For one sign of the afflicted man’s disease</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is to give ready faith to things which please.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If good Anglante’s lord the prize forbore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor seized the fair occasion when he might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loss be his, if Fortune never more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him to enjoy so fair a prize invite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To imitate that lord of little lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I think not,” said, apart, Circassia’s knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To quit such proffered good, and, to my shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have but myself on after-thought to blame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No! I will pluck the fresh and morning rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, should I tarry, may be overblown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To woman, (this my own experience shows,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No deed more sweet or welcome can be done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, whatsoever scorn the damsel shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though she awhile may weep and make her moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will, unchecked by anger, false or true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sharp repulse, my bold design pursue.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, he for the soft assault prepares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When a loud noise within the greenwood shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside him, rang in his astounded ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sore against his will the monarch stayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He donned his helm (his other arms he wears),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye wont to rove in steel, with belted blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Replaced the bridle on his courser fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grappled his lance, and sprang into his seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the bold semblance of a valiant knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold a warrior threads the forest hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger’s mantle was of snowy white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And white alike the waving plume he wore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Balked of his bliss, and full of fell despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch ill the interruption bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spurred his horse to meet him in mid space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hate and fury glowing in his face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him he defies to fight, approaching nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And weens to make him stoop his haughty crest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other knight, whose worth I rate as high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His warlike prowess puts to present test;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cuts short his haughty threats and angry cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spurs, and lays his levelled lance in rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In tempest wheels Circassia’s valiant peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at his foeman’s head each aims his spear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not brindled bulls or tawny lions spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To forest warfare with such deadly will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As those two knights, the stranger and the king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their spears alike the opposing bucklers thrill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The solid ground, at their encountering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trembles from fruitful vale to naked hill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well it was the mail in which they dressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their bodies was of proof, and saved the breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor swerved the chargers from their destined course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who met like rams, and butted head to head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warlike Saracen’s ill-fated horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well valued while alive, dropt short and dead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger’s, too, fell senseless; but perforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was roused by rowel from his grassy bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That of the paynim king, extended straight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay on his battered lord with all his weight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upright upon his steed, the knight unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who at the encounter horse and rider threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming enough was in the conflict done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cares not the worthless warfare to renew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But endlong by the readiest path is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And measures, pricking frith and forest through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mile, or little less, in furious heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere the foiled Saracen regains his feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the bewildered and astonished clown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who held the plough (the thunder storm o’erpast)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There, where the deafening bolt had beat him down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh his death-stricken cattle, wakes aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sees the distant pine without its crown,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-17" id="noteref-17" epub:type="noteref">17</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he saw clad in leafy honours last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So rose the paynim knight with troubled face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The maid spectatress of the cruel case.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He sighs and groans, yet not for mischief sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endured in wounded arm or foot which bled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for mere shame, and never such before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or after, dyed his cheek so deep a red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if he rued his fall, it grieved him more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His dame should lift him from his courser dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He speechless had remained, I ween, if she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not his prisoned tongue and voice set free.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Grieve not,” she said, “sir monarch, for thy fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let the blame upon thy courser be!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom more welcome had been forage, stall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rest, than further joust and jeopardy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well thy foe the loser may I call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Who shall no glory gain) for such is he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is the first to quit his ground, if aught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica of fighting fields be taught.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While she so seeks the Saracen to cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold a messenger with pouch and horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On panting hackney!⁠—man and horse appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the long journey, weary and forlorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He questions Sacripant, approaching near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he seen warrior pass, by whom were borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A shield and crest of white; in search of whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the wide forest pricked the weary groom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Sacripant made answer, “As you see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He threw me here, and went but now his way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then tell the warrior’s name, that I may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Informed whose valour foiled me in the fray.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the groom⁠—“That which you ask of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall relate to you without delay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know that you were in combat prostrate laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the tried valour of a gentle maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Bold is the maid; but fairer yet than bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor the redoubted virgin’s name I veil:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas Bradamant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-18" id="noteref-18" epub:type="noteref">18</a> who marred what praise of old</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your prowess ever won with sword and mail.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This said, he spurred again, his story told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left him little gladdened by the tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He recks not what he says or does, for shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his flushed visage kindles into flame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the woeful warrior long had thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his cruel case, and still in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found a woman his defeat had wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thinking but increased the monarch’s pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He climbed the other horse, nor spake he aught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But silently uplifted from the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the croup bestowed that damsel sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reserved to gladder use in safer seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two miles they had not rode before they hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sweeping woods which spread about them, sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such loud crash and trample, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The forest seemed to tremble all around;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shortly after see a steed appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With housings wrought in gold and richly bound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who clears the bush and stream, with furious force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whatsoever else impedes his course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Unless the misty air,” the damsel cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And boughs deceive my sight, yon noble steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is, sure, Bayardo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-19" id="noteref-19" epub:type="noteref">19</a> who before us flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And parts the wood with such impetuous speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Yes, ’tis Bayardo’s self I recognize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How well the courser understands our need!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two riders ill a foundered jade would bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But hither speeds the horse to end that care.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bold Circassian lighted, and applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hand to seize him by the flowing rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, swiftly turning, with his heels replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he like lightning wheeled upon the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Woe to the king! but that he leaps aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For should he smite, he would not lash in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such are his bone and sinew, that the shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his good heels had split a metal rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to the maid he goes submissively,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gentle blandishment and humble mood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the dog greets his lord with frolic glee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom, some short season past, he had not viewed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For good Bayardo had in memory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albracca, where her hands prepared his food,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the damsel loved Rinaldo bold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, then ungrateful, stern, and cold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With her left hand she takes him by the bit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the other pats his sides and chest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the good steed (so marvellous his wit),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamb-like, obeyed the damsel and caressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meantime the king, who sees the moment fit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leapt up, and with his knees the courser pressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While on the palfrey, eased of half his weight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady left the croup, and gained the seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, as at hazard, she directs her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounding in arms a man on foot espies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And glows with sudden anger and despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she in him the son of Aymon eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her more than life esteems the youthful knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While she from him, like crane from falcon, flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Time was the lady sighed, her passion slighted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis now Rinaldo loves, as ill requited.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this effect two different fountains wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose wonderous waters different moods inspire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both spring in Arden, with rare virtue fraught:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This fills the heart with amorous desire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who taste that other fountain are untaught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their love, and change for ice their former fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo drank the first, and vainly sighs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica the last, and hates and flies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mixed with such secret bane the waters glide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which amorous care convert to sudden hate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The maid no sooner had Rinaldo spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than on her laughing eyes deep darkness sate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with sad mien and trembling voice she cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Sacripant, and prayed him not to wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The near approach of the detested knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But through the wood with her pursue his flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To her the Saracen, with anger hot:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Is knightly worship sunk so low in me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou should’st hold my valour cheap, and not</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sufficient to make yonder champion flee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already are Albracca’s fights forgot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that dread night I singly stood for thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That night when I, though naked, was thy shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against King Agrican and all his field?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She answers not, and knows not in her fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What ’tis she does; Rinaldo is too nigh:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from afar that furious cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threats the bold Saracen with angry cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as the known steed and damsel dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose charms such flame had kindled, meet his eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what ensued between the haughty pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I in another canto shall declare.</span>

					<span>Another love assails Bireno’s breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who leaves one night Olympia on the shore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Logistilla’s holy realm addressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rogero goes, nor heeds Alcina more:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him, of that flying courser repossest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hippogryph on airy voyage bore:</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>

				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Of all the loves, of all fidelity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet proved, of all the constant hearts and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the lovers, in felicity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sorrow faithful found, a famous crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Olympia I would give the first degree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than second: if this be not due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I well may say that hers no tale is told</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of truer love, in present times or old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this she by so many proofs and clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had made apparent to the Zealand lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No woman’s faith more certain could appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To man, though he her open heart explored:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if fair truth such spirits should endear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they in mutual love deserve reward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bireno as himself, nay, he above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself, I say, should kind Olympia love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not only should he nevermore deceive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her for another, were that woman she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who so made Europe and wide Asia grieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or fairer yet, if one more fair there be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But rather that quit her the light should leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what is sweet to taste, touch, hear, and see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And life and fame, and all beside; if aught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More precious can in truth be styled, or thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If her Bireno loved, as she had loved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bireno, if her love he did repay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With faith like hers, and still with truth unmoved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Veered not his shifting sail another way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or ingrate for such service⁠—cruel proved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such fair love and faith, I now will say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you with lips comprest and eyebrows bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall listen to the tale for wonderment;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when you shall have heard the impiety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of such passing goodness was the meed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Woman take warning from this perfidy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let none make a lover’s word her creed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mindless that God does all things hear and see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lover, eager his desires to speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaps promises and vows, aye prompt to swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which afterwards all winds disperse in air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The promises and empty vows dispersed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In air, by winds all dissipated go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After these lovers have the greedy thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeased, with which their fevered palates glow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this example which I offer, versed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their prayers and tears to credit be more slow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cheaply, dear ladies mine, is wisdom bought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By those who wit at other’s cost are taught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of those in the first flower of youth beware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose visage is so soft and smooth to sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For past, as soon as bred, their fancies are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like a straw-fire their every appetite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the keen hunter follows up the hare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In heat and cold, on shore, or mountain-height;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, when ’tis taken, more esteems the prize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And only hurries after that which flies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such is the practice of these striplings who,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time you treat them with austerity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love and revere you, and such homage do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As those who pay their service faithfully;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But vaunt no sooner victory, than you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From mistresses shall servants grieve to be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mourn to see the fickle love they owed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From you diverted, and elsewhere bestowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I not for this (for that were wrong) opine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you should cease to love; for you, without</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lover, like uncultivated vine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would be, that has no prop to wind about.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the first down I pray you to decline,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fly the volatile, inconstant rout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make your choice the riper fruits among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet to gather what too long has hung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A daughter they have found (above was said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the proud king who ruled the Friesland state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with Bireno’s brother was to wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As far as rumour tells; but to relate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The truth, a longing in Bireno bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sight of food so passing delicate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he to talk his palate deemed would be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For other’s sake, a foolish courtesy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The gentle damsel had not past fourteen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was beautiful and fresh, and like a rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When this first opening from its bud is seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the vernal sun expands and grows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To say Bireno loved the youthful queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were little; with less blaze lit tinder glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or ripened corn, wherever envious hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of foe amid the grain has cast a brand,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Than that which on Bireno’s bosom fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his marrow burned; when, weeping sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fate of her unhappy father dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw her bathed in ceaseless tears deplore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as cold water, on the cauldron shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shops short the bubbling wave, which boiled before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was the raging rife Olympia blew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within his breast, extinguished by a new.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor feels Bireno mere satiety;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loathes her so, he ill endures her sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if his hope he long deferred, will die:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For other such his fickle appetite!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet till the day prefixed to satisfy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fond desire, so feigns the wary knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia less to love than to adore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seems, and but her pleasure to explore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And if the other he too much caress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cannot <em>but</em> caress her, there are none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">See evil in the deed, but rather guess</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is in pity, is in goodness done:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since to raise up and comfort in distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Fortune’s wheel beats down in changeful run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never blamed; with glory oftener paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—So much the more, a young⁠—a harmless maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almighty God! how fallible and vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is human judgment, dimmed by clouds obscure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bireno’s actions, impious and profane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By others are reputed just and pure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already stooping to their oars, the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have loosed his vessel from the port secure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the duke and his companions steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Zealand through the deep, with meery cheer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already Holland and its headlands all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are left astern, and now descried no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since to shun Friesland they to larboard hawl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And keep their course more nigh the Scottish shore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they are overtaken by a squall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drive three days the open sea before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the third, when now, near eventide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A barren and unpeopled isle is spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as they were harboured in a hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia landed and the board was spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She there contented, with the faithless knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Supt, unsuspecting any cause for dread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence, with Bireno, where a tent was pight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pleasant place, repaired, and went to bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The others of their train returned abroad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rested in their ship, in haven moored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fear and late sea sorrow, which had weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long upon the dame and broke her rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The finding herself safe in greenwood shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Removed from noise, and, for her tranquil breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Knowing her lover was beside her laid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No further thoughts, no further cares molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia lap in slumber so profound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sheltered bear or dormouse sleeps more sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lover false, who, hatching treason lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stole from his bed in silence, when he knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She slept: his clothes he in a bundle ties,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other raiment on his body threw.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then issuing forth from the pavilion hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if on new-born wings, towards his crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, roused, unmoor without a cry, as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Commands, and loosen thence and put to sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behind the land was left; and there to pine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia, who yet slept the woods among;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till from her gilded wheels the frosty rhine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aurora upon earth beneath had flung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the old woe, beside the tumbling brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamenting, halcyons mournful descant sung;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-134" id="noteref-134" epub:type="noteref">134</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she, ’twixt sleep and waking, made a strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To reach her loved Bireno, but in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She no one found; the dame her arm withdrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She tried again, yet no one found; she spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both arms, now here, now there, and sought anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now either leg; but yet no better sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fear banished sleep; she oped her eyes: in view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was nothing: she no more her widowed bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would keep, but from the couch in fury sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And headlong forth from the pavilion flung,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And seaward ran, her visage tearing sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Presaging, and now certain of her plight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She beat her bosom, and her tresses tore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And looked (the moon was shining) if she might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discover any thing beside the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, save the shore, was any thing in sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She calls Bireno, and the caverns round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pitying her grief, Bireno’s name rebound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the far shore there rose a rock; below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scooped by the breaker’s beating frequently:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cliff was hollowed underneath, in show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of arch, and overhung the foaming sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia (<b>mind</b> such vigour did bestow)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sprang up the frowning crest impetuously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at a distance, stretched by favouring gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence saw her cruel lord’s departing sail:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saw it, or seemed to see: for ill her eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Things through the air, yet dim and hazy, view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She falls, all-trembling, on the ground, and lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With face than snow more cold and white in hue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when she has again found strength to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guiding her voice towards the bark which flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calling with all her might, the unhappy dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calls often on her cruel consort’s name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where unavailing was the feeble note,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wept and clapt her hands in agony.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-135" id="noteref-135" epub:type="noteref">135</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Without its freight,” she cried, “thy ship does float.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Where, cruel, dost thou fly so swiftly?⁠—me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Receive as well:⁠—small hinderance to thy boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which bears my spirit, would my body be.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she her raiment waving in her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Signed to the frigate to return to land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the loud wind which, sweeping ocean, bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faithless stripling’s sail across the deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears off as well the shriek, and moan, and prayers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sad Olympia, sorrowing on the steep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrice, cruel to herself, the dame prepares</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the high rock amid the waves to leap.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from the water lifts at length her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there returns where she had passed the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stretched on the bed, upon her face she lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bathing it with her tears. “Last night in thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together two found shelter,” did she say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Alas! why two together are not we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At rising? False Bireno! cursed day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I was born! What here remains to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To do? What can be done?⁠—Alone, betrayed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will console me, who afford me aid?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor man I see, nor see I work, which shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That man inhabits in this isle; nor I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">See ship, in which (a refuge from my woes),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embarking, I from hence may hope to fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here shall I starve; nor any one to close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My eyes, or give me sepulture, be by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save wolf perchance, who roves this wood, a tomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give me, alas! in his voracious womb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I live in terror, and appear to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rough bear or lion issue even now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or tiger, from beneath the greenwood tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or other beast with teeth and claws: but how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can ever cruel beast inflict on me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O cruel beast, a fouler death than thou?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough for them to slay me once! while I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am made by thee a thousand deaths to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But grant, e’en now, some skipper hither fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who may for pity bear me hence away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that I so eschew wolf, lion, bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Torture, and dearth, and every horrid way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of death; to Holland shall he take me, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thee is guarded fortilage and bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or take me to the land where I was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this thou hast from me by treachery torn?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou, with pretence, from me my state didst wrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of our connection and of amity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quickly of my land thy troops possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To assure the rule unto thyself. Shall I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return to Flanders where I sold the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though little, upon which I lived, to buy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee needful succour and from prison bear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wretch, whither shall I go?⁠—I know not where.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Can I to Friesland go, where I to reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As queen was called, and this for thee forewent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where both my brethren and my sire were slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every other good from me was rent?⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee would I not, thou ingrate, with my pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reproach, not therefore deal thee punishment:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as I, the story dost thou know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, see the meed thou dost for this bestow!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh! may I but escape the wild corsair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor taken be, and after sold for slave!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than this may lion, wolf, or bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tiger, or other beast, if fiercer rave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me with his claws and rushes rend and tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drag my bleeding body to his cave.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying she her golden hair offends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lock by lock the scattered tresses rends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She to the shore’s extremest verge anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tossing her head, with hair dishevelled, run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seemed like maid beside herself, and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by ten fiends possessed, instead of one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of like the frantic Hecuba, at view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of murdered Polydore, her infant son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixed on a stone she gazed upon the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less than real stone seemed stone to be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But let her grieve till my return. To show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now of the child I wish: his weary way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, in the noon’s intensest glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes by the shore: the burning sunbeams play</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the hill and thence rebound; below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Boils the white sand; while heated with the ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little is wanting in that journey dire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the arms he wears are all on fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While to the warrior thirst and labour sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still toiling through that heavy sand, as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued his path along the sunny shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were irksome and displeasing company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the shadow of a turret hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which rose beside the beach, amid the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He found three ladies of Alcina’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As such distinguished by their dress and port.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Reclined on Alexandrian carpets rare<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ladies joyed the cool in great delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About them various wines in vessels were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every sort of comfit nicely dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast by, and sporting with the ripple there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay, waiting on their needs, a pinnace light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until a breeze should fill her sail anew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For then no breath upon the waters blew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They, who beheld along the shifting sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero wend, upon his way intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw thirst figured on his lips, and scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His troubled visage, all with sweat besprent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Began to pray, “on what he had in hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would not show his heart so deeply bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he in the cool and grateful shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would rest his weary limbs, beside them laid.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To hold the stirrup one approaching near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would aid him to alight: the other bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cup of crystal to the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With foaming wine, which raised his thirst the more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to the music of their speech no ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He lent, who weened if he his way forbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For anything, each lett would time supply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Alcina to arrive, who now was nigh.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now so salt-petre fine and sulphur pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touched with the fiery spark, blaze suddenly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not so loud ocean raves, when the obscure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whirlwind descends and camps in middle sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As viewing thus the knight proceed secure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his journey, and aware that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scorns them, who yet believe they beauteous are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kindled the third of those three damsels fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As loud as she could raise her voice, she said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thou art not gentle, nor art thou a knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hast from other arms and horse conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which never could be thine by better right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So be thy theft, if well I guess, appaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By death, which this may worthily requite!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foul thief, churl, haughty ingrate, may I thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Burned, gibbeted, or cut in quarters see!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beside all these and more injurious cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the proud damsel at the warrior throws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though to her taunts Rogero nought replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who weens small fame from such a contest flows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She with her sisters to the frigate hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which waits them, and aboard the tender goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plying fast her oars, pursues the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the sandy beach, still kept in sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On him with threat and curse she ever cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose tongue collected still fresh cause for blame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, where to the lovelier fairy’s side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The passage lay across a straight, he came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there an ancient ferryman espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put from the other shore with punctual aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if forewarned and well prepared, the seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waited the coming of the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ferryman put forth the Child to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bear him to a better shore rejoicing: he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared as all benign and all discreet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If of the heart the face is warranty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Giving God thanks, Rogero took his seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aboard the bark, and passed the quiet sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discoursing with that ancient pilot, fraught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wisdom, and by long experience taught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He praised Rogero much, that he had fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In time from false Alcina, and before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the dame had given the chalice dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her lover’s final guerdon evermore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next that he had to Logistilla sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he should duly witness holy lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And beauty infinite and grace enjoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which feed and nourish hearts they never cloy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her shall you, struck with wonderment, revere,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He said), “when first you shall behold the fay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But better contemplate her lofty cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you no other treasure shall appay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this her love from other differs; fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hope in other on the bosom prey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In hers Desire demands not aught beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the blessing seen is satisfied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You shall in nobler studies be professed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tutored by her, than bath and costly fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Song, dance, and perfumes; as how fashioned best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your thoughts may tower more high than hawks in air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how some of the glory of the blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You here may in the mortal body share.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So speaking, and yet distant from the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the safe bank approached the pilot hoar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he beholds forth-issuing from the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fleet of ships, which all towards him steer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these came wronged Alcina, with a band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many vassals, gathered far and near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To risk the ruin of herself and land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or repossess the thing she held so dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love, no light cause, incites the dame aggrieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less the bitter injury received.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such choler she had never felt before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that which now upon her bosom fed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence she made her followers ply the oar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the white foam on either bank was shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The deafening noise and din o’er sea and shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By echo every where repeated, spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Now⁠—now, Rogero, bare the magic shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or in the strife be slain, or basely yield:”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus Logistilla’s pilot; and beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, seized the pouch, wherein was dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The buckler, and the covering torn aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exposed to open view the shining light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The enchanted splendour, flashing far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sore offends the adversaries’ sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They from their vessels drop amazed and blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tumbling from prow before, and poop behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One who stood sentry on the citadel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descried the navy of the invading dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And backwards rang the castle larum-bell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence speedy succours to the haven came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The artillery rained like storm, whose fury fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On all who would Rogero scathe and shame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that such aid was brought him in the strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As saved the warrior’s liberty and life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Four ladies are arrived upon the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither by Logistilla sped in haste:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leagued with the valiant Anrondica stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fronesia sage, Dicilla good, and chaste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sofrosina, who, as she has in had</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than the others, ’mid the foremost placed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conspicuous flames. Forth issues from the fort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A matchless host, and files towards the port.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beneath the castle, safe from wind and swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many ships and stout, a squadron lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, in the harbour, at a sound from bell⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A word, were fit for action, night or day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus by land and sea was battle, fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And furious, waged on part of either fay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence was Alcina’s realm turned upside down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of which she had usurped her sister’s crown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! of how many battles the success</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is different from what was hoped before!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only failed the dame to repossess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As thought, her lover flying from her shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But out of ships, even now so numberless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ample ocean scarce the navy bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all her vessels, to the flames a prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with one bark escaped the wretched fay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alcina flies; and her sad troop around</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Routed and taken, burnt or sunk, remains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have lost Rogero, sorrow more profound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wakes in her breast than all her other pains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she in bitter tears for ever drowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the Child’s loss by night and day complains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bent to end her woes, with many a sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often laments her that she cannot die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No fairy dies, or can, while overhead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun shall burn, or heaven preserve their stile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Clotho had been moved to cut her thread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touched by such grief; or, as on funeral pile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair Dido, she beneath the steel had bled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, haply, like the gorgeous Queen of Nile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In mortal slumber would have closed her eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fairies cannot at their pleasure die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Return we, where eternal fame is due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving Alcina in her trouble sore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of valorous Rogero, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had disembarked upon the safer shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turned his back upon the waters blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Giving God thanks for all with pious lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on dry ground now landed, made repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the lofty castle planted there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Than this a stronger or more bright in show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never yet before of mortal sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or after, viewed; with stones the ramparts glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More rich than carbuncle or diamond bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We of like gems discourse not here below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who would their nature read aright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must thither speed: none such elsewhere, I ween,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except perhaps in heaven above, are seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What gives to them superiority</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er every other sort of gem, confessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is, man in these his very soul may see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His vices and his virtues see expressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence shall he after heed no flattery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet by wrongful censure be depressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His form he in the lucid mirror eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the knowledge of himself grows wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their rays, which imitate the sunshine, fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All round about with such a flood of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he who has them, Phoebus, may at will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Create himself a day, in thy despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only marvellous the gems; the skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the artificer and substance bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So well contend for mastery, of the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis hard to judge where preference is due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On arches raised, whereon the firmament</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed to repose as props, so fair in show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are lovely gardens, and of such extent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As even would be hard to have below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clustering ’twixt lucid tower or battlement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Green odoriferous shrubs are seen to grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which through the summer and the winter shoot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And teem with beauteous blossom and ripe fruit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Never in any place such goodly tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is grown, except within these gardens fine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or rose, or violet of like quality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lilies, or amaranth, or jessamine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Elsewhere it seems as if foredoomed to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Born with one sun, to live and to decline,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon its widowed stalk the blossom dies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Subject to all the changes of the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But here the verdure still is permanent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still permanent the eternal blossoms are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that kind nature, in her government,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So nicely tempers here the genial air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that, unneeding any influence lent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By planet, Logistilla’s zeal and care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever keep fast (what may appear a thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impossible) her own perpetual spring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That such a gentle lord had sought her rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did much the prudent Logistilla please,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she commanded he should be carest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all should seek to do him courtesies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sometime had Sir Astolpho been her guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom with a joyful heart Rogero sees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There in few days resorted all the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changed by Melissa to their shapes anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they a day or more their weariness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had eased, Rogero sought the prudent fay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him the duke Astolpho, who no less</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desired to measure back his western way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa was for both embassadress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for the warlike pair, with humble say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To favour, warn and help them, prayed the dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they might return from whence they came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I” (said the fay) “will think upon this need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in two days the pair will expedite.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then thought how good Rogero she should speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards how aid the English knight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wills the first shall, on the griffin steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the Aquitanian shores direct his flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first will fashion for the flying-horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bit, to guide him and restrain his course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She shows him what to do, if he on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would make him soar, or down to earth would bring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what, would he in circles make him fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or swiftly speed, or pause upon the wing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all that skilful horsemen use to try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon plain ground, beneath her tutoring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero learned in air, and gained dominion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over the griffin-steed of soaring pinion.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When at all points Rogero was prepared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bade farewell to the protecting fay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ever to the loving knight endeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issued from her realm upon his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I first of him, who on his journey fared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In happy hour, and afterwards shall say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the English knight, who spent more time and pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeking the friendly court of Charlemagne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero thence departs; but as before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes not the way he took in his despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When him above the sea the courser bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seldom was the land beneath in sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But taught to make him beat his wings and soar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, there, as liked him best, with docile flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning, he another path pursued;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Magi erst, who Herod’s snare eschewed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Borne hither, good Rogero, leaving Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had sought, in level line, the Indian lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where they are watered by the Eastern main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the two fairies strove with hostile bands.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He now resolved to visit other reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that where Aeolus his train commands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finish so the round he had begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Circling the world beneath him like the sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here the Catày, and there he Mangiane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passing the great Quinsay<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-138" id="noteref-138" epub:type="noteref">138</a> beheld; in air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above Imavus turned, and Sericane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left on the right; and thence did ever bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the north Scythians to the Hyrcanian main:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So reached Sarmatia’s distant land; and, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Europe and Asia’s parted climes divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Russ, Prussian, he and Pomeranian spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Although the Child by every wish was pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly to seek his Bradamant, yet he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With taste of roving round the world possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not desist from it, till Hungary</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had seen; and Polacks, Germans, and the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should in his wide extended circuit see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inhabiting that horrid, northern land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And came at last to England’s farthest strand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet think not, sir, that in so long a flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior is for ever on the wing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lodges, housed in tavern every night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As best as can, through his capacious ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So nights and days he passes: such delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prospects to him of land and ocean bring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived one morn nigh London-town, he stopt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And over Thames the flying courser dropt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where he in meadows to the city nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw troops of men at arms, and footmen spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, to the drum and trumpet marching by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divided into goodly bands, were led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before Rinaldo, flower of chivalry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He that (if you remember it) was said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have been sent by Charlemagne, and made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His envoy to these parts in search of aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero came exactly as the show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that fair host was made without the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of a knight the occasion sought to know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from the griffin-horse first lighted down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who courteous was, informed him how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of kingdoms holding of the British crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">English, Scotch, Irish, and the Islands nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those many banners were, upreared on high:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And added, having ended this display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of arms, the troops would file towards the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where vessels anchored in the harbour lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waiting to bear them to another land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The French beseiged, rejoice in this array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hope (he said) deliverance through the band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that I may of all inform you well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of each troop shall separately tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lo! where yon mighty banner planted stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which pards and flower-de-luces does unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That our great captain to the wind expands,</span>

				<span class="i1">And notes and talks of ensigns they display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And names of British lords, to him repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and another, crowding to survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His courser, single of its kind, or rare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All thither hasten, wondering and astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And compassing the warrior, form a round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So that to raise more wonder in the train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to make better sport, as him they eyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero shook the flying courser’s rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lightly with the rowels touched his side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He towards heaven, uprising, soared amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left behind each gazer stupefied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having from end to end the English force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So viewed, he next for Ireland shaped his course;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And saw fabulous Hibernia, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goodly, sainted elder made the cave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-142" id="noteref-142" epub:type="noteref">142</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which men cleansed from all offences are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such mercy there, it seems, is found to save.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence o’er that sea he spurred, through yielding air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose briny waves the lesser Britain lave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, looking down, Angelica descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In passing, to the rock with fetters tied;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bound to the naked rock upon the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the isle of tears; for the isle of tears was hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That which was peopled by the inhuman band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So passing fierce and full of foul despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who (as I told above) on every hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cruized with their scattered fleet by day or night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every beauteous woman bore away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destined to be a monster’s evil prey:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There but that morning bound in cruel wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where (to devour a living damsel sped)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The orc, that measureless sea-monster, hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on abominable food is fed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How on the beach the maid became the prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the rapacious crew, above was said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who found her sleeping near the enchanter hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who her had thither brought by magic lore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cruel and inhospitable crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the voracious beast the dame expose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the sea-beat shore, as bare to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As nature did at first her work compose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not even a veil she had, to shade the hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the white lily and vermillion rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which mingled in her lovely members meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proof to December-snow and July-heat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her would Rogero have some statue deemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of alabaster made, or marble rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the rugged rock so fastened seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the industrious sculptor’s cunning care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he saw distinct a tear which streamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid fresh-opening rose and lily fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stand on her budding paps beneath in dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that her golden hair dishevelled flew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as he fastened <em>his</em> on <em>her</em> fair eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Bradamant he called to mind again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pity and love within his bosom rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At once, and ill he can from tears refrain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in soft tone he to the damsel cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(When he has checked his flying courser’s rein)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O lady, worthy but that chain to wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which Love’s faithful servants fettered are,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And most unworthy this or other ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wretch has had the cruelty to wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gall those snowy hands with livid stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus painfully with griding fetters bound?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At this she cannot choose but show like grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of crimson spreading on an ivory ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowing those secret beauties are espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, howsoever lovely, shame would hide;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And gladly with her hands her face would hood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were they not fastened to the rugged stone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with her tears (for this at least she could)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bedewed it, and essayed to hold it down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobbing some while the lovely damsel stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then loosed her tongue and spake in feeble tone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ended not; arrested in mid-word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By a loud noise which in the sea was heard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! and behold! the unmeasured-beast appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Half surging and half hidden, in such sort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As sped by roaring wind long carack steers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From north or south, towards her destined port.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the sea monster to his food repairs:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now the interval between is short.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Half dead the lady is through fear endured,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill by that other’s comfort reassured.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero overhand, not in the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Carries his lance, and beats, with downright blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monstrous orc. What this resembled best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But a huge, writhing mass, I do not know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which wore no form of animal exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save in the head, with eyes and teeth of sow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His forehead, ’twixt the eyes, Rogero smites,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But as on steel or rock the weapon lights.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he perceives the first of no avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight returns to deal a better blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The orc, who sees the shifting shadow sail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those huge pinions on the sea below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In furious heat, deserts his sure regale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On shore, to follow that deceitful show:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rolls and reels behind it, as it fleets.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero drops, and oft the stroke repeats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As eagle, that amid her downward flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surveys amid the grass a snake unrolled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or where she smoothes upon a sunny height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her ruffled plumage, and her scales of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assails it not where prompt with poisonous bite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hiss and creep; but with securer hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gripes it behind, and either pinion clangs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest it should turn and wound her with its fangs;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the fell orc Rogero does not smite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lance or faulchion where the tushes grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But aims that ’twixt the ears his blow may light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now on the spine, or now on tail below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still in time descends or soars upright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shifts his course, to cheat the veering foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But as if beating on a jasper block,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can never cleave the hard and rugged rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With suchlike warfare is the mastiff vext</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the bold fly in August’s time of dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or in the month before or in the next,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This full of yellow spikes and that of must;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ever by the circling plague perplext,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose sting into his eyes or snout is thrust:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft the dog’s dry teeth are heard to fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But reaching once the foe, he pays for all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With his huge tail the troubled waves so sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monster beats, that they ascend heaven-high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the knight knows not if he swim, or soar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his feathered courser in mid sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft were fain to find himself ashore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, if long time the spray so thickly fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fears it so will bathe his hippogryph,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he shall vainly covet gourd or skiff.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-143" id="noteref-143" epub:type="noteref">143</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He then new counsel took, and ’twas the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other arms the monster to pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lifting from his shield the covering vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To dazzle with the light his blasted view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Landward towards the rock-chained maid he pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on her little finger, lest a new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mischance should follow, slipt the ring, which brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The enchantment of the magic shield to nought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say the ring, which Bradamant, to free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, from Brunello’s hand had rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which, to snatch him from Alcina, she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had next to India by Melissa sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa (as before was said by me),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In aid of many used the instrument;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to Rogero this again had born;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom ’twas ever on his finger worn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He gave it now Angelica; for he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feared lest the buckler’s light should be impaired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And willed as well those beauteous eyes should be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defended, which had him already snared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pressing beneath his paunch full half the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to the shore the monstrous whale repaired:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm stood Rogero, and the veil undone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared to give the sky another sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He in the monster’s eyes the radiance throws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which works as it was wont in other time.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As trout or grayling to the bottom goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In stream, which mountaineer disturbs with lime;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the enchanted buckler overthrows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The orc, reversed among the foam and slime.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero here and there the beast astound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still beats, but cannot find the way to wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while the lady begs him not to bray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Longer the monster’s rugged scale in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For heaven’s sake turn and loose me” (did she say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still weeping) “ere the orc awake again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bear me with thee, and drown me in mid-way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let me not this foul monster’s food remain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her just plaint Rogero moved, forebore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Untied the maid, and raised her from the shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the beach the courser plants his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goaded by the rowel, towers in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gallops with Rogero in mid seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While on the croup behind him sate the fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of his banquet so the monster cheat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him too delicate and dainty fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero turns and with thick kisses plies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady’s snowy breast and sparkling eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He kept no more the way, as he before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proposed, for compassing the whole of Spain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But stopt his courser on the neighbouring shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where lesser Britain runs into the main.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the bank there rose an oakwood hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Philomel for ever seemed to plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the middle was a meadow with a fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at each end, a solitary mountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas here the wishful knight first checked the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dropping in the meadow, made his steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Furl, yet not shut so close, his wings again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he had spread them wide for better speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Down lights Rogero, and forbears with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From other leap; but this his arms impede:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms impede; a bar to his desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he must doff them would he slake the fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now here, now there, confused by different throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero did his shining arms undo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never the task appeared to him so long;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For where he loosed one knot, he fastened two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, sir, too long continued is this song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply may as well have wearied you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that I shall delay to other time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When it may better please, my tedious rhyme.</span>

				<span>Although a feeble rein, in mid career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will oft suffice to stop courageous horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis seldom Reason’s bit will serve to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desire, or turn him from his furious course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When pleasure is in reach: like headstrong bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom from the honeyed meal ’tis ill to force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If once he scent the tempting mess, or sup</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A drop, which hangs upon the luscious cup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What reason then Rogero shall withhold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From taking with Angelica delight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gentle maid, there naked in his hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the lone forest, and secure from sight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Bradamant he thinks not, who controlled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bosom erst: and foolish were the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thinking of <em>that</em> damsel as before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By <em>this</em> he had not set an equal store;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Warmed by whose youthful beauties, the severe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Xenocrates would not have been more chaste.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-144" id="noteref-144" epub:type="noteref">144</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The impatient Child had dropt both shield and spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hurrying now his other arms uncased;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, casting down her eyes in shame and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The virtuous ring upon her finger placed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica descried, and which of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her Brunello in Albracca bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This is the ring she carried into France,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-145" id="noteref-145" epub:type="noteref">145</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thither first the damsel took her way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her the brother, bearer of the lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After, the paladin, Astolpho’s prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this she Malagigi’s spells and trance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made vain by Merlin’s stair; and on a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando freed, with many knights and good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Dragontina’s cruel servitude:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With this passed viewless from the turret-cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where her that bad old man had mewed; but why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Recount its different wonders, if as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You know the virtues of the ring as I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her this even in her citadel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His monarch Agramant to satisfy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello took: since where she had been crost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Fortune, till her native realm was lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now that she this upon her hand surveys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She is so full of pleasure and surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She doubts it is a dream, and, in amaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hardly believes her very hand and eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then softly to her mouth the hoop conveys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, quicker than the flash which cleaves the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From bold Rogero’s sight her beauty shrowds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As disappears the sun, concealed in clouds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet still Rogero gazed like wight distraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hurried here and there with fruitless speed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when he had recalled the ring to thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foiled and astounded, cursed his little heed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now the vanished lady, whom he sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that ungrateful and discourteous deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accusing stood, wherewith she had repaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Unfitting recompense) his generous aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ungrateful damsel! and is this the pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You render for the service done?” (said he)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Why rather would you steal my ring away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than have it as a welcome gift from me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only this, (but use me as you may)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, and my shield and courser, yours shall be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So you no more conceal your beauteous cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cruel, though answering not, I know you hear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, like one blind, with bootless care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feeling his way about the fount he strayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How often he embraced the empty air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping in this to have embraced the maid!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, now far removed, the flying fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had halted not, till to a cave conveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Formed in a mountain was that harbour rude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spacious, and for her need supplied with food.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas here an aged herdsman, one who tended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A numerous troop of mares, had made his won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, seeking pasture, through the valley wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the green grass was fed by freshening run:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While stalls on either side the cave, defended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His charge from the oppressive noontide sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, within, that livelong day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unseen of prying eyes, prolonged her stay;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And about evening, when refreshed with rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And food, she deemed her course she might renew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In certain rustic weeds her body dressed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How different from those robes of red, or blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Green, yellow, purple, her accustomed vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So various in its fashion, shape, and hue!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet her not so that habit misbecame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that she looked the fair and noble dame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Phillis’ and Neaera’s praise forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ye who sing of Amaryllis cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or flying Galataea,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-146" id="noteref-146" epub:type="noteref">146</a> not so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tityrus and Melibaeus, with your peace!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas here the beauteous lady took a mare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which liked her best, of all that herd’s increase.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, and then first conceived the thought, again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek in the Levant her ancient reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while Rogero, after he had passed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long space in hope the maid might reappear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Awakened from his foolish dream at last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found she was not nigh, and did not hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to remount his griffin-courser cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In earth and air accustomed to career.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, having slipt his bit, the winged horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had towered and soared in air a freer course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To his first ill addition grave and sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was to have lost the bird of rapid wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he no better than the mockery bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put on him by the maid; but deeper sting</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than this or that, implants, and pains him more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thought of having lost the precious ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not for its power so much, esteemed above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its worth, as given him by his lady-love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Afflicted beyond measure, he, with shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast on his shoulder, and new-cased in mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left the sea-side, and through a grassy field</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued his way, towards a spacious vale:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he beheld a path, by wood concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The widest and most beaten in the dale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor far had wound the closest shades within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere on his right he heard a mighty din.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He heard a din, and fearful clashing sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of arms, and hurrying on with eager pace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt tree and tree, two furious champions found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waging fierce fight in close and straightened place:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to each other (warring on what ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not) neither showed regard nor grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The one a giant was of haughty cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one a bold and gallant cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Covered with shield and sword, one, leaping, sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here now there, and thus himself defended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest a two-handed mace upon his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should fall, with which the giant still offended:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the field lay his horse, already dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero paused, and to the strife attended:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight his wishes leant towards the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he would fain see conqueror in the fight:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet not for this would lend the champion aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to behold the cruel strife stood nigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! a two-handed stroke the giant made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the lesser warrior’s casque, and by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty blow the knight was overlaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other, when astound he saw him lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To deal the foe his death, his helm untied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the warrior’s face Rogero spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of his sweet lady, of his passing fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dearest Bradamant Rogero spies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lovely visage, of its helmet bare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards whom, to deal her death, the giant hies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that, advancing with his sword in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sudden battle him the Child defies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, who will not wait for new alarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes the half-lifeless lady in his arm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And on his shoulder flings and bears away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As sometimes wolf a little lamb will bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or eagle in her crooked claws convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pigeon, or suchlike bird, through liquid air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero runs with all the speed he may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sees how needed is his succour there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with such strides the giant scours the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him with his eyes the knight pursues with pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This flying and that following, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kept a close path which widened still, and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Piercing that forest, issued forth to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a wide meadow, which without it lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—No more of this. Orlando I pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That bore Cymosco’s thunderbolt away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this had in the deepest bottom drowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That never more the mischief might be found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But with small boot: for the impious enemy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of human nature, taught the bolt to frame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After the shaft, which darting from the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pierces the cloud and comes to ground in flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when he tempted Eve to eat and die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the apple, hardly wrought more scathe and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some deal before, or in our grandsires’ day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guided a necromancer where it lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>More than a hundred fathom buried so,</span>

				<span class="i1">Where hidden it had lain a mighty space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The infernal tool by magic from below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was fished and born amid the German race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, by one proof and the other, taught to know</span>

				<span>And I shall think, in order to pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sin for ever, God has doomed to hell</span>

				<span class="i1">But follow we the good Orlando, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So burns to seek Ebuda’s island fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose foul inhabitants a monster sate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With flesh of women, fair and delicate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But no less slow than eager was the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winds appear, which still his course delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, whether blowing on the left or right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or poop, so faintly in his canvas play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bark makes little speed; and, spent outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The breeze which wafts her sometimes dies away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or blows so foul, that he is fain to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another course, or to the leeward veer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was the will of Heaven that he, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The King of Ireland, should not reach the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The he with greater ease upon that shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might act what shortly you shall understand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Make for the isle. Now” (said he) “may’st thou moor.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Thus issuing to the pilot his command),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And give me for my need the skiff; for I</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bade them lower the pinnace overboard,</span>

				<span class="i1">With all things that befitted his design:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms he left behind, except his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And singly for the rocky island made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Home to his breast the count pulls either oar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the island at his back, to which he wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In guise that, crawling up the sandy shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crooked crab from sea or marsh ascends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was the hour Aurora gay before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rising sun her yellow hair extends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(His orb as yet half-seen, half-hid from sight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not without stirring jealous Tithon’s spite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Approaching to the naked rock as near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As vigorous hand might serve to cast a stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knew not if he heard, or did not hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cry, so faint and feeble was the moan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, turning to the left, the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His level sight along the water thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked as born, bound to a stump, espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A dame, whose feet were wetted by the tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because she distant is, and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Holds down her face, he ill can her discern:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both sculls he pulls amain, and nears the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With keen desire more certain news to learn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now the winding beach is heard to roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wood and cave the mighty noise return;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The billows swell, and, lo! the beast! who pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nigh concealed the sea beneath his breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As cloud from humid vale is seen to rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pregnant with rain and storm, which seems withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To extinguish day, and charged with deeper dyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than night, to spread throughout this earthly ball,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So swims the beast, who so much occupies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sea, he may be said to keep it all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waves roar: collected in himself, the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Looks proudly on, unchanged in heart and cheer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, as one well resolved in his intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved quickly to perform the feat he planned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for he would the damsel’s harm prevent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would with that assail the beast at hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between her and the orc the boat he sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving within the sheath his idle brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anchor and cable next he takes in hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And waits the foe with constant heart and bold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as him the monster has descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And skiff at little interval, his throat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fish, to swallow him, expands so wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That horse and horseman through his jaws might float.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Roland with the anchor, and beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Unless I am mistaken) with the boat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunged, and engulphed the parted teeth betwixt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His anchor in the tongue and palate fixt;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So that the monster could no longer drop</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or raise his horrid jaws, which this extends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis thus who digs the mine is wont to prop</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ground, and where he works the roof suspends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest sudden ruin whelm him from atop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he incautiously his task intends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland (so far apart was either hook)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But by a leap could reach the highest crook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The prop so placed, Orlando now secure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the fell beast his mouth no more can close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unsheathes his sword, and, in that cave obscure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deals here and there, now thrusts, now trenchant blows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as citadel, whose walls immure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The assailants, can defend her from her foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monster, harassed by the war within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defends himself against the Paladin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now floats the monstrous beast, o’ercome with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose scaly flanks upon the waves expand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now descends into the deepest main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scowers at the bottom, and stirs up the sand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rising flood ill able to sustain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier swims forth, and makes for land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He leaves the anchor fastened in his tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grasps the rope which from the anchor hung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So swimming till the island is attained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this towards the rock Orlando speeds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hawls the anchor home (a footing gained),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pricked by whose double fluke, the monster bleeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The labouring orc to follow is constrained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragged by that force which every force exceeds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which at a single sally more achieves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than at ten turns the circling windlass heaves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As a wild bull, about whose horn is wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unexpected noose, leaps here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he has felt the cord, and turns him round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rolls and rises, yet slips not the snare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So from his pleasant seat and ancient bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragged by that arm and rope he cannot tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thousands of strange wheels and thousand slides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monster follows where the cable guides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This the red sea with reason would be hight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To-day, such streams of blood have changed its hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where the monster lashed it in his spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The eye its bottom through the waves might view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now he splashed the sky, and dimmed the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the clear sun, so high the water flew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The noise re-echoing round, the distant shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wood and hill rebound the deafening roar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forth from his grotto aged Proteus hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mounts above the surface at the sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having seen Orlando dive, and rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the orc, and drag the monstrous fish to ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His scattered flock forgot, o’er ocean flies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While so the din increases, that, astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neptune bids yoke his dolphins, and that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For distant Aethiopia posts away.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-149" id="noteref-149" epub:type="noteref">149</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With Melicerta on her shoulders, weeping</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ino,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-150" id="noteref-150" epub:type="noteref">150</a> and Nereids with dishevelled hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Glauci, Tritons, and their fellows, leaping</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They know not whither, speed, some here, some there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando draws to land, the billows sweeping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That horrid fish, but might his labour spare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, with the torment worn, and travel sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brute, exhausted, died, ere dragged ashore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of the islanders had trooped no petty throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To witness that strange fight, who by a vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And miserable superstition stung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed such holy deed a work profane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said “that this would be another wrong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Proteus, and provoke his ire again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make him his herds pour forth upon the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the whole old warfare vex the land;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And that it better were to sue for peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First from the injured god, lest worse ensue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Proteus from his cruel hate would cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If they into the sea the offender threw.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As torch to torch gives fire, and lights increase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the flame is spread the country through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even so from heart to heart the fury spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in the waves would doom Orlando dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These, armed with sling or bow, upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these supplied with spear or sword descend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on each side, behind him and before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Distant and near, as best they can, offend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At such a brutal insult wonders sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The peer, who sees that mischief they intend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In vengeance for the cruel monster slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence he had glory hoped, and praise to gain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But as the usage is of surly bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By sturdy Russ or Lithuanian led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little to heed the dogs in crowded fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even at their yelps to turn his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The clamour of the churls assembled there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando witnessed with as little dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who knew that he the rout which threatened death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had power to scatter at a single breath:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And speedily he made them yield him place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When turned on them, he grasped his trenchant blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Misjudging of his worth, the foolish race</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed that he would have short resistance made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since him they saw no covering buckler brace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uncuirassed, nor in other arms arrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But knew not that, from head to foot, a skin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More hard than diamond cased the Paladin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What by Orlando others cannot do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight by others can: at half a score</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of blows in all he thirty killed; by few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He pass’d that measure, if the strokes were more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had already turned him to undo</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The naked lady, having cleared the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When other larum sounds, and other cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From a new quarter of the island rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While so the Paladin had kept in play</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The barbarous islanders, upon that hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The men of Ireland, without let or fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had poured from many quarters on the strand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, without remorse or pity, slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The inhabitants, through all the wasted land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, was it justice moved, or cruel rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slaughter without regard to sex or age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Little or no defender the island-crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Attempt; in part as taken unaware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In part that in the little place are few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that those few without a purpose are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid sack and fire, the wasted country through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The islanders are slain, and everwhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The walls are upon earth in ruin spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in the land is left a living head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As if the mighty tumult which he hears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shriek and ruin had concerned him nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The naked rock the bold Orlando nears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where <b>she</b> was placed, to feed the monster brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He looks, and known to him the dame appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more appears, when nigher her he sought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia she appears, and is indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympia, whose faith reaped so ill a meed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wretched Olympia; whom, beside the scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Love put on her, Fortune too pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sent the corsairs fell, which her had borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That very day to the island of Ebude.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She Roland recollects on his return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Landward; but, for the damsel naked stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only nought she to the warrior said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But dared not raise her eyes, and dropt her head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando asks what evil destiny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to that cruel island had conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From where she in as much felicity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was with her consort left as could be said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I know not (cried the weeping dame) if I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have thanks to render thee for death delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or should lament me that, through means of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This day did not my woes concluded see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I have to thank thee that from death, too dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And monstrous, thy good arm deliverance gave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which would have been too monstrous, had I fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beast, and in his belly found a grave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cannot thank thee that I am not dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since death alone can me from misery save.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well shall I thank thee for that wished relief</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which can deliver me from every grief.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next she related, with loud sobs and sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How her false spouse betrayed her as she lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Asleep, and how of pirates made the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They bore her from the desert isle away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as she spake, she turned her in the guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Dian, framed by artists, who portray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her carved or painted, as in liquid font</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She threw the water in Actaeon’s front.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For, as she can, her waist she hides, and breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More liberal of flowing flank and reins.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland desires his ship, to find a vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cover her, delivered from her chains:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he is all intent upon this quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oberto comes; Oberto he that reigns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er Ireland’s people, who had understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How lifeless lay the monster of the flood;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, swimming, how, amid the watery roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A knight a weighty anchor in his throat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had fix’d, and so had dragged him to the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As men against the current track a boat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while Oberto comes; who, if his lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who told the tale, were true, desires to note;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While his invading army, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ebuda burn and waste on every side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oberto, though the Paladin to sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was dripping, and with water foul and gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gore, that from the orc, emerged to light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he had entered bodily, he bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He for the country knew the stranger knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he perused his face; so much the more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he had thought when told the tidings, none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save Roland could such mighty fear have done;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Knew him, because a page of honour he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been in France,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-151" id="noteref-151" epub:type="noteref">151</a> and for the crown, his right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his father’s death, had crossed the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The year before. So often he the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had seen, and had with him held colloquy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their times of meeting had been infinite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He doffed his casque, with festive welcome pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the count, and clasped him to the breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando is no less rejoined to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king, than is the king that champion true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After with friendly cheer and equal glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had once or twice embraced the noble two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Oberto Roland told the treachery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had been done the youthful dame, and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had done it⁠—false Bireno⁠—that among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All men should least have sought to do her wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him he told the many proofs and clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which the dame’s affection had been tried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how she for Bireno kin and geer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had lost, and would in fine for him have died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he this could warrant, and appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To vouch for much, as witness on her side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While thus to him her griefs Orlando showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady’s shining eyes with tears o’erflowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her face was such as sometimes in the spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We see a doubtful sky, when on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A shower descends, and the sun, opening</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cloudy veil, looks out amid the rain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as the nightingale then loves to sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From branch of verdant stem her dulcet strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So in her beauteous tears his pinions bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love bathes, rejoicing in the crystal light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The stripling heats his golden arrow’s head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At her bright eyes, then slacks the weapon’s glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In streams, which falls between white flowers and red;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, the shaft tempered, strongly draws his bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And roves at him, o’er whom no shield is spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor iron rind, nor double mail below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, gazing on her tresses, eyes, and brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feels that his heart is pierced, he knows not how.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Olympia’s beauties are of those most rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is the forehead’s beauteous curve alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excellent, and her eyes and cheeks and hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mouth, nose, and throat, and shoulders; but, so down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descending from the lady’s bosom fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Parts which are wont to be concealed by gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are such, as haply should be placed before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whate’er this ample world contains in store.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In whiteness they surpass’d unsullied snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smooth ivory to the touch; above were seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two rounding paps, like new-press’d milk in show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fresh-taken from its crate of rushes green;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-152" id="noteref-152" epub:type="noteref">152</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The space betwixt was like the valley low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which oftentimes we see small hills between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sweet in its season: and now such as when</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Winter with snows has newly filled the glen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The swelling hips and haunches’ symmetry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The waist more clear than mirror’s polished grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And members seem of Phidias’ turnery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or work of better hand and nicer pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well to you of other parts should I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relate, which she to hide desired in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sum the beauteous whole, from head to feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her all loveliness is found complete.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And had she in the Idaean glen unveiled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In ancient days before the Phrygian swain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By how much heavenly Venus had prevailed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not, though her rivals strove in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor haply had the youth for Sparta sailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To violate the hospitable reign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But said; “With Menelaus let Helen rest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other prize I seek, of this possest;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or in Crotona dwelt, where the divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zeuxis in days of old his work projected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be the ornament of Juno’s shrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence so many naked dames collected;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in one form perfection to combine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some separate charm from this or that selected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from no other model need have wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since joined in her were all the charms he sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I do not think Bireno ever viewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked that beauteous form; for sure it were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never could have been so stern of mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to have left her on that desert lair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Ireland’s king was fired I well conclude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor hid the flame that he within him bare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He strives to comfort her, and hope instill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That future good shall end her present ill:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And her to Holland promises to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vows till she is to her state restored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And just and memorable vengeance there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achieved upon her perjured, traitor lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never will unceasing war forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waged with all means that Ireland can afford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this with all his speed. He, up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meantime bids seek for female vest and gown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now will it need to send in search of vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the savage island’s narrow bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since thither every day in such came dressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some dame, to feed the beast, from countries round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor long his followers there pursued the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere many they of various fashions found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was Olympia clothed; while sad of mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was he, not so to clothe her as he wou’d.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But never silk so choice or gold so fine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did the industrious Florentine prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor whosoever broiders gay design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though on his task be spent time, toil, and care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Lemnos’ god, nor Pallas’ art divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Form raiment worthy of those limbs so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That King Oberto cannot choose but he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Recalls them at each turn to memory.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To see that love so kindled by the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On many grounds Orlando was content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who not alone rejoiced that such a shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put upon her, Bireno should repent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, that in the design on which he came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should be freed from grave impediment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not for Olympia thither had he made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, were his lady there, to lend her aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him, that there she was not, soon was clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But clear it was not if she had been there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or no; since of those islesmen, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One was not left the tidings to declare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The following day they from the haven steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all united in one squadron fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Paladin with them to Ireland hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence to France the warrior’s passage lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarcely a day in Ireland’s realm he spends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for no prayers his purposed end forbore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love, that in quest of his liege-lady sends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight upon this track, permits no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departing, he Olympia recommends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the Irish monarch, who to serve her swore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although this needed not; since he was bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than behoved, her wishes to content:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So levied in few days his warlike band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (league with England’s kind and Scotland’s made)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Holland and in Friesland left no land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the false duke, so rapid was the raid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to rebel against that lord’s command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Zealand stirred; nor he the war delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until by him Bireno’s blood was spilt:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A punishment that ill atoned his guilt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oberto takes to wife Olympia fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her of countess makes a puissant queen.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-153" id="noteref-153" epub:type="noteref">153</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But be the Paladin again our care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who furrows, night and day, the billows green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strikes his sails in the same harbour, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They to the wind erewhile unfurled had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All armed, he on his Brigliadoro leaps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaves behind him winds and briny deeps.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The remnant of the winter, he with shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spear achieved things worthy to be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I ween; but these were then so well concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is no fault of mine they are not blown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For good Orlando was in fighting field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prompter to do, than make his prowess known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor e’er was bruited action of the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save when some faithful witness was in sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That winter’s remnant he so passed that feat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his was known not to the public ear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when within that animal discreet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Phryxus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-154" id="noteref-154" epub:type="noteref">154</a> bore, the sun illumed the sphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Zephyrus returning glad and sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought back with him again the blooming year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wondrous deeds Orlando did in stower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared with the new grass and dainty flower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From plain to hill, from champaign flat to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oppressed with grief and pain the County fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When a long cry, entering a forest hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A load lamenting smites upon his ears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He grasps his brand and spurs his courser sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And swiftly pricks toward the sound he hears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I shall at another season say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What chanced, and may be heard in future lay.</span>

					<span epub:type="label">Canto</span>
					<span epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">XII</span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>Orlando, full of rage, pursues a knight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who bears by force his lady-love away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And comes where old Atlantes, by his sleight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had raised a dome, Rogero there to stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here too Rogero comes; where getting sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his lost love, the County strives in fray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fierce Ferraù, and, after slaughter fell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amid the paynim host, finds Isabel.</span>
				</p>

			<p>
				<span>Ceres, when from the Idaean dame in haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning to the lonely valley, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enceladus the Aetnaean mountain placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On his bolt-smitten flanks, is doomed to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her girl she found not, on that pathless waste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her late quitted, having rent her hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And marked cheeks, eyes, and breast, with livid signs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the end of her lament tore up two pines,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And lit at Vulcan’s fire the double brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave them virtue never to be spent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, afterwards, with one in either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drawn by two dragons, in her chariot went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searching the forest, hill, and level land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Field, valley, running stream, or water pent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The land and sea; and having searched the shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of earth above, descended into hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had Roland of Eleusis’ deity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sovereign power possessed no less than will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He for Angelica had land and sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ransacked, and wood and field, and pool and rill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven, and Oblivion’s bottom: but since he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not, his pressing purpose to fulfil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her dragon and her car, the unwearied knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued the missing maid as best he might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through France he sought her, and will seek her through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The realms of Italy and of Almàyn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence through the Castiles, both old and new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So passing into Libya out of Spain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While bold Orlando has this plan in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hears, or thinks he hears, a voice complain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He forward spurs, and sees on mighty steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A warrior trot before him on the mead;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who in his arms a captive damsel bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore grieving, and across the pommel laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She weeps and struggles, and the semblance wears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of cruel woe, and ever calls for aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon Anglantes’ prince; and now appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him, as he surveys the youthful maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, for whom, night and day, with ceaseless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inside and out, he France had searched in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say not is, but that she to the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seems the Angelica he loves so dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who is lady-love and goddess’ flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds, borne off in such afflicted cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impelled by fury foul, and angry spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calls back with horrid voice the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calls back the cavalier, and threats in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Brigliadoro drives with flowing rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That felon stops not, nor to him replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On his great gain intent, his glorious prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with such swiftness through the greenwood hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wind would not overtake him on his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The one pursues while him the other flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with lament resounds the thicket gray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They issue in a spacious mead, on which</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appears a lofty mansion, rare and rich.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of various marbles, wrought with subtle care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is the proud palace. He who fast in hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears off upon his arm the damsel fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore pricking, enters at a gate of gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Brigliador is far behind the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Backed by Orlando, angry knight and bold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entering, around Orlando turns his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet neither cavalier nor damsel spies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He suddenly dismounts, and thundering fares</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the inmost palace, seeking still his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here and there in restless rage repairs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he has seen each bower, each galleried row;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the same purpose he ascends the stairs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having first vainly searched each room below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor spends less labour, on his task intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above, than he beneath had vainly spent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here beds are seen adorned with silk and gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor of partition aught is spied or wall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For these, and floor beneath, throughout that hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are hid by curtains and by carpets all.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-155" id="noteref-155" epub:type="noteref">155</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here, now there, returns Orlando bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet can glad his eyes, in bower or hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the appearance of the royal maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or the foul thief by whom she was conveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while, as here and there in fruitless pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He moves, oppressed with thought and trouble sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso, Brandimart, and him of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù, he finds, with Sacripant and more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who ever toiling, like himself, in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above, that building, and beneath explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as they wander, curse with one accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The malice of the castle’s viewless lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All in pursuit of the offender speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And upon him some charge of robbery lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One knight complains that he has stolen his steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that he has purloined his lady gay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other accuses him of other deed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus within the enchanted cage they stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can depart; while in the palace pent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many have weeks and months together spent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roland, when he round that strange dome had paced</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Four times or six, still vainly seeking, said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within himself, at last, “I here might waste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My time and trouble, still in vain delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While haply her the robber whom I chased</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has far away, through other gate conveyed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So thinking, from the house he issued out</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the mead which girt the dome about.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Roland wanders round the sylvan Hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still holding close his visage to the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see if recent print or trace withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can, right or left, upon the turf be found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from a neighbouring window hears a call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And looks, and thinks he hears that voice’s sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thinks he sees the visage by which he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was so estranged from what he wont to be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He thinks he hears Angelica, and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Help, help!” entreating cries, and weeping sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“More than for life and soul, alas! of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Protection for my honour I implore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then shall it in my Roland’s presence be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ravished by this foul robber? Oh! before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me to such miserable fate you leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let me from your own hand my death receive!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These words repeated once, and yet again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made Roland through each chamber, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return with passion, and with utmost pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But tempered with high hope. Sometimes the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stopt in his search and heard a voice complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seemed to be Angelica’s: if here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The restless warrior stand, it sounds from there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And calls for help he knows not whence nor where.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Returning to Rogero, left, I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When through a gloomy path, upon his steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Following the giant and the dame who fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the wood had issued on the mead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say that he arrived where Roland dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived before him, if I rightly read.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The giant through the golden portal passed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero close behind, who followed fast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as he his foot has lifted o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The threshold, he through court and gallery spies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sees the giant or the lady more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly glances here and there his eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He up and down returns with labour sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not for that his longing satisfies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can imagine where the felon thief</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has hid himself and dame in space so brief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After four times or five he so had wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above, below, through bower and gallery fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He yet returned, and, having nothing found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searched even to the space beneath the stair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length, in hope they in the woodlands round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might be, he sallied; but the voice, which there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland recalled, did him no less recall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made as well return within the Hall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One voice, one shape, which to Anglantes’ peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed his Angelica, beseeching aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed to Rogero Dordogne’s lady dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him a truant to himself had made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If with Gradasso, or with other near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He spake, of those who through the palace strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To all of them the vision, seen apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed that which each had singly most at heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was a new and unwonted spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the renowned Atlantes had composed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in this toil, this pleasing pain, might dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long Rogero, by these walls enclosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him should pass away the influence fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Influence which him to early death exposed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though vain his magic tower of steel, and vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alcina’s art, Atlantes plots again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not only he, but others who stood high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For valour, and in France had greatest fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That by their hands Rogero might not die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought here by old Atlantes’ magic came:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While these in the enchanted mansion lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That food be wanting not to knight or dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He has supplied the dome throughout so well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all the inmates there in plenty dwell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But to Angelica return we, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now of that ring so wondrous repossessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Which, in her mouth, concealed the maid from view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Preserved from spell when it the finger pressed,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in the mountain-cavern guided to</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever needed, viands, mare, and vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had conceived the project to pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her way to her fair Indian realm anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Sacripant, or Roland, willingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel would have taken for her guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that, propitious to their wishes, she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Averse from both) inclined to either side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, since her eastern journey was to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through town and city, scattered far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She needed company, and ill had found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More trusty guides than these for such a round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now this, now that she sought with fruitless care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before she lit on either warrior’s trace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By city or by farm, now here, now there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In forest now, and now in other place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fortune, at length, where caged with Roland are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù and Sacripant, directs her chase;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, with Gradasso fierce, and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Noosed with strange witcheries by Atlantes hoar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She enters, hidden from the enchanter’s eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the ring concealed, examines all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Roland there, and Sacripant espies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent to seek her vainly through that Hall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with her image cheating both, descries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atlantes old. The damsel doubts withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of the two to take, and long revolves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This in her doubtful thought, nor well resolves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She knows not which with her will best accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Count Orlando or Circassia’s knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As of most prowess, her would Roland ward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In passage perilous, with better might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But should she make the peer her guide, her lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She knew not if her champion she could slight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If him she would depress with altered cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or into France send back the cavalier:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Sacripant at pleasure could depose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though him she had uplifted to the sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence him alone she for her escort chose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And feigned to trust in his fidelity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ring she from her mouth withdraws, and shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her face, unveiled to the Circassian’s eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thought to him alone; but fierce Ferraù</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Roland came upon the maid, and saw.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ferraù and Roland came upon the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For one and the other champion equally</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the palace and without it strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In quest of her, who was their deity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, no longer by the enchantment stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each ran alike towards the dame, for she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had placed the ring upon her hand anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which old Atlantes’ every scheme o’erthrew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Helm on the head and corselet on the breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of both the knights, of whom I sing, was tied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By night or day, since they into this rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had entered, never doffed and laid aside:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such to wear were easy as a vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To these, so wont the burden to abide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well was armed, except with iron masque,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù, who wore not, nor would wear, a casque,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till he had that erst wrested by the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, from the brother of Troyane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so had sworn the Spanish cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time he Argalìa’s helm in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought in the brook; yet though the count was near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has not stretched forth his hand the prize to gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so it was, that neither of the pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could recognise the other knight while there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the enchanted dome lay such a spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they from one another were concealed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They doffed not, night nor day, the corselet’s shell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not sword, nor even put aside the shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saddled, with bridle hanging at the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their steeds were feeding, ready for the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within a chamber, near the palace door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With straw and barley heaped in plenteous store.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor might nor mean in old Atlantes lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stop the knights from mounting, who repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To their good steeds, to chase the bright black eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fair vermillion cheeks and golden hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the sweet damsel, who before them flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goads to better speed her panting mare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill pleased the three assembled to discern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though haply she had taken each in turn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when these from the magic palace she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had ticed so far, that she no more supposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warriors to the wicked fallacy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the malign enchanter were exposed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ring, which more than once from misery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had rescued her, she ’twixt her lips enclosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence from their sight she vanished in a thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left them wondering there, like men distraught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Although she first the scheme had entertained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland or Sacripant to have released,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To guide her thither, where her father reigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Galaphron, who ruled i’ the farthest East,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The aid of both she suddenly disdained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in an instant from her project ceased;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed, without more debt to count or king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In place of either knight sufficed the ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In haste, they through the forest, here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So scorned of her, still gaze with stupid face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like questing hound which loses sight of hare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or fox, of whom he late pursued the trace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into close thicket, ditch, or narrow lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Escaping from the keen pursuer’s chase.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meantime their ways the wanton Indian queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Observes, and at their wonder laughs unseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the mid wood, where they the maid did lose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was but a single pathway, left or right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which they believed the damsel could not choose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But follow, when she vanished from their sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù halts not, and Roland fast pursues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Sacripant less plies the rowels bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, this while, retrains her steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And follows the three warriors with less speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When pricking thus they came to where the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in the forest lost, with wood o’ergrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had begun the herbage to survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For print of recent footsteps, up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fierce Ferraù, who might have borne away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all that ever proudest were, the crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With evil countenance, to the other two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned him about, and shouted “Whence are you?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Turn back or take another road, save here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In troth, you covet to be slain by me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor when I chase or woo my lady dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let any think I bear with company.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—“What more could he say, sir cavalier,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Orlando cried to Sacripant) “if we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were known for the two basest whores that pull</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reel from spindle-staff the matted wool?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then turning to Ferraù, “But that thine head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou brutish sot, as I behold, is bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thy late words were ill or wisely said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou should’st perceive, before we further fare.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him Ferraù; “For that which breeds no dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In me, why should’st thou take such sovereign care?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What I have said unhelmed will I prove true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, single as I am, on both of you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh!” (to Circassia’s king cried Roland dread)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thy morion for this man let me entreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till I have driven such folly from his head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For never with like madness did I meet.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Who then would be most fool?” the monarch said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But if indeed you deem the suit discreet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lend him thine own; nor shall I be less fit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply than thee to school his lack of wit.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“Fools, both of you!” (the fierce Ferraù replied)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“As if, did I to wear a helm delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You would not be without your casques of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already reft by me in your despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But know thus much, that I by vow am tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wear no helm, and thus my promise quite;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-156" id="noteref-156" epub:type="noteref">156</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roaming without, till that fine casque I win</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worn by Orlando, Charles’s paladin.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“Then” (smiling, to the Spaniard said the count)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“With naked head, thou thinkest to repeat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Roland what he did in Aspramont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Agolant’s bold son: but shouldst thou meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior whom thou seekest, front to front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I warrant thou wouldst quake from head to feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only wouldst forego the casque, but give</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight thine other arms to let thee live.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“So oft have I had Roland on the hip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft,” (exclaimed the boaster) “heretofore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him it had been easy task to strip</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What other arms, beside his helm, he wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if I still have let the occasion slip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—We sometimes think of things unwished before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such wish I had not; I have now; and hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To compass easily my present scope.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The good Orlando could no more forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cried, “Foul miscreant, liar, marched with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say, caitiff, in what country, when and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Boast you to have obtained such victory?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That paladin am I, o’er whom you dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To vaunt, and whom you distant deemed: now see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you can take my helm, or I have might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take your other arms in your despite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor I o’er you the smallest vantage would.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ended, and his temples disarrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to a beech hung up the helmet good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nigh as quickly bared his trenchant blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù stands close, and in such attitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(His courage not for what had chanced dismayed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covered with lifted shield and naked sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might best shelter to his head afford.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas thus those warriors two, with faulchions bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turning their ready steeds, began to wheel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where the armour thinnest was, and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The meeting plates were joined, probed steel with steel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was there in the world another pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More fitted to be matched in fierce appeal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equal their daring, equal was their might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And safe alike from wound was either knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By you, fair sir, already, I presume,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fierce Ferraù was charmed is understood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save where the child, enclosed within the womb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the full mother, takes its early food;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence he ever, till the squalid tomb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covered his manly face, wore harness good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such was his wont) the doubtful part to guard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of seven good plates of metal, tempered hard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alike a charmed life Orlando bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safe every where, except a single part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfenced beneath his feet, which evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him were guarded with all care and art.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest than diamond dug from mountain hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More hard, unless report from truth depart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And armed to battle either champion went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less for necessity than ornament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Waxing more fierce and fell the combat rages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fear and horror full, between the twain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fierce Ferraù such dreadful battle wages,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That stroke or thrust is never dealt in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each mighty blow from Roland disengages</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loosens, breaks, or shatters, plate and chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica alone, secure from view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Regards such fearful sight, and marks the two.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For, during this, the king of Circassy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who deemed Angelica not far before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Ferraù and Orlando desperately</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Closing in fight were seen, his horse did gore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the way by which he deemed that she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had disappeared; and so that battle sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was witnessed ’twixt the struggling foes, by none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the daughter of king Galaphron.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the damsel had sometime descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This dread and direful combat, standing nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it appearing that on either side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With equal peril both the warriors vie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, fond of novelty, the helm untied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Designs to take; desirous to espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What they would do when they perceived the wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, without thought to keep her plunder long.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To give it to Orlando was she bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first she would upon the warrior play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The helmet she took down with this intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in her bosom hid, and marked the fray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next thence, without a word to either went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the scene of strife was far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere either of the two had marked the feat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So were they blinded by their angry heat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Ferraù, who first chanced the loss to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Roland disengaged himself, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How like unwary men and fools are we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Treated by him, who late with us did ride!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What meed, which worthiest of the strife might be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this be stolen, the victor shall abide?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland draws back, looks upward, and with ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Missing the noble casque, is all on fire:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in opinion with Ferraù agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he the knight, who was with them before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had born away the prize; hence turned his steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the spur admonished Brigliador.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù, who from the field beheld him speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed him, and when Roland and the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived where tracks upon the herbage green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the Circassian and the maid were seen,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Towards a vale upon the left the count</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went off, pursuing the Circassian’s tread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Spaniard kept the path more nigh the mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which the fair Angelica had fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, this while, has reached a fount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of pleasant site, and shaded overhead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whose inviting shades no traveller hasted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever left the crystal wave untasted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Angelica, the sylvan spring beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reposes, unsuspicious of surprise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thinking her the sacred ring will hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fears not that evil accident can rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her arrival at the fountain’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to a branch above the helmet ties;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then seeks the fittest sapling for her need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, fastened to its trunk, her mare may feed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Spanish cavalier the stream beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, who had pursued her traces there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica no sooner him espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than she evanished clean, and spurred her mare:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-157" id="noteref-157" epub:type="noteref">157</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The helm this while had dropt, but lay too wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be recovered of the flying fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as sweet Angelica he saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards her full of rapture sprang Ferraù.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She disappeared, I say, as forms avaunt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At sleep’s departure: toiling long and sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seeks the damsel there, ’twixt plant and plant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now can his wretched eyes behold her more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blaspheming his Mahound and Termagant,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-158" id="noteref-158" epub:type="noteref">158</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cursing every master of his lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù returned towards the sylvan fount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where lay on earth the helmet of the count.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This he soon recognised, for here he read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Letters upon the margin, written fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which how Orlando won the helmet said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from what champion took, and when and where.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With it the paynim armed his neck and head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would not for his grief the prize forbear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His grief for loss of her, conveyed from sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As disappear the phantoms of the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When in this goodly casque he was arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deemed nought wanting to his full content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the discovery of the royal maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who like a flash of lightning came and went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her he searches every greenwood shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when all hope of finding her is spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He for the vain pursuit no longer tarries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to the Spanish camp returns near Paris;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tempering the grief which glowed within his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such sore disappointment, with the thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he was with Orlando’s morion blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As sworn. By good Anglante’s count, when taught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the false Saracen the prize possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long time the Spanish knight was vainly sought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Roland took the helmet from his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he between two bridges laid him dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Angelica thus, viewless and alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speeds on her journey, but with troubled front;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grieved for the helmet, in her haste foregone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her departure from the grassy fount.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Choosing to do what I should least have done,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(She said) “I took his helmet from the count.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This for his first desert I well bestow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A worthy recompense for all I owe!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With good intentions, as God knows, I wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though these an ill and different end produce;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I took the helmet only with the thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring that deadly battle to a truce;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not that this foul Spaniard what he sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should gain, or I to his intent conduce.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So she, lamenting, took herself to task</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For having robbed Orlando of his casque.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By what appeared to her the meetest way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moody and ill-content she eastward pressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ofttimes concealed, sometimes in face of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As seemed most opportune and pleased her best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After much country seen, a forest gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She reached, where, sorely wounded in mid breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between two dead companions on the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The royal maid a bleeding stripling found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But of Angelica I now no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall speak, who first have many things to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor shall to the Circassian or the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give for long space a rhyme; thence called away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By good Anglante’s prince, who wills, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of those others tell, I should display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The labours and the troubles he sustained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursuing the great good he never gained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the first city, whither he was brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Because to go concealed he had good care),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He a new helmet donned; but took no thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What was the head-piece he designed to bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So safe is he in fairy spell, it nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imports, if hard or soft its temper were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, covered thus, pursues the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor him day, night, or rain, or sun arrest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was the hour that our of Ocean’s bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dan Phoebus drew his dripping steeds, and high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And low, still scattering yellow flowers and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aurora stained the heavens with various dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Stars had cast their veils about their head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departing from their revels in the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When passing on a day fair Paris near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando made his mighty worth appear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two squadrons he encountered; one an old</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saracen, Manilardo clept, obeyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King of Noritia, whilom fierce and bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fitter now to counsel than to aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The next beneath the standard was enrolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Tremisena’s monarch, who was said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid Africans to be a perfect knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alzirdo he by those who knew him, hight:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These, with the other Saracen array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cantoned throughout the winter months had lain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some near the city, some more far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All lodged nigh town or hamlet on the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For since King Agramant had many a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spent in attacking Paris’ walls in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He (for no other means remained to try)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would lastly with a siege the city ply;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to do this had people infinite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he, beside the host that with him came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that of Spain which followed to the fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Spanish King Marsilius’ oriflame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many of France did in his pay unite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all from Paris he to Arles’s stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With part of Gascony, some straggling tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excepted, had reduced beneath his power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The quivering brook, as warmer breezes blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beginning now from ice its waves to free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the fresh-springing grass and foliage new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To clothe again the field and greenwood tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All those King Agramant assembled, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had followed him in his prosperity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To muster in review the armed swarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And give to his affairs a better form:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hence did the King of Tremisen’ repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him who had Noritia in command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be in time at that full muster, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each squadron, good or bad, was to be scanned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando thus by chance encountered there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As I have told you, this united hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, as his usage was, went seeking her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom he had been made Love’s prisoner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alzirdo, as the approaching count he eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in this world for valour has no peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such a haughty front, and in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The God of war would less in arms appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The features known before astounded spies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fierce, disdainful glance and furious cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him esteems a knight of prowess high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, fondly, he too sore desires to try.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Arrogant, young, and of redoubted force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alzirdo was, and prized for dauntless mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bent to joust pricked forth his foaming horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Happier had he remained in line behind!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Met by Anglante’s prince in middle course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who pierced his heart as they encountering joined.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frighted, the lightened courser scoured the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a rider to direct the rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rises a sudden and a horrid cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And air on every side repeats the scream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As his scared band the falling youth descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issuing from his wound so wide a stream:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disordered, they the count in fury ply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, raised to cut or thrust, their weapons gleam.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against that flower of knights, their feathered reeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thicker squadron yet in tempest speeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With sound like that, with which from hill repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or from the champaign’s flat the hurrying swine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(If the Wolf, issue from his grot, or Bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descending to the mountains’ lower line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some bristly youngling take away and tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with loud squeal and grunt is heard to pine)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came driving at the count the barbarous rout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Upon him!” and “upon him!” still their shout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At once spears, shafts, and swords, his corslet bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By thousands, and as many pierce his shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This threatens on one side, and that before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those the ponderous mace behind him wield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he esteems the craven rout no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, who did never yet to terror yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than hungry Wolf in twilight makes account</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To what the number of the flock may mount.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He held unsheathed that thundering sword in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which with so many foes has heaped the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he who thinks to count the slaughtered band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has undertaken hard emprize and vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The road ran red, ensanguined by his brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scarce capacious of the many slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For neither targe nor head-piece good defends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where fatal Durindana’s blade descends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor safety cotton vest, nor cloths supply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In thousand folds about the temples spread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only groan and lamentation fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through air, but shoulder, arm, and severed head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Death roams the field in strange variety</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of horrid forms, and all inspiring dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And says, “For hundreds of my scythes may stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Durindana in Orlando’s hand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His ceaseless strokes scarce one the other wait:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speedily all his foemen are in flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when before they came at furious rate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They hoped to swallow quick the single knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None is there who, in that unhappy straight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stops for his comrade, flying from the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here one man speeds afoot, one gallops there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None stays to question if the road be fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His mirror Valour bore about, and here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each blemish of the soul was seen confest:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-159" id="noteref-159" epub:type="noteref">159</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None looked therein, except an aged peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose blood was chilled, but courage unreprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That death were better deems this cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than life in flight, and in disgrace possest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I mean Noritia’s king, who lays his lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In rest against the paladin of France;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He broke it on the border of the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the intrepid count, with steadfast hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, by the stroke unshaken, nothing reeled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smote the king, in passing, with his brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him Fortune saved; for as Orlando wheeled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The blade, it turned, descending, in his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although an-edge he guides not still the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stunned from his saddle reels the paynim lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astounded from his saddle reels the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor him Orlando turns about to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cuts, and cleaves, and slays his following;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who all believe him at their backs to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As through the spacious air, with troubled wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The starlings from the daring merlin flee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, of that broken squadron, scattered round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some fly, some dip, and some fall flat to ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ceased not his ensanguined blade to sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till living wight remained not in his view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando doubted to resume his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although the country all about he knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does he the right or left-hand road assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His thoughts still rove from what his steps pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he to seek the damsel is in dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through other path than that by which she fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through wood and field his courser did he goad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often inquiring for the royal dame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside himself, he strayed beside his road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the foot of rising mountain came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence (it was night-time) through a fissure glowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The distant flicker of a quivering flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando to the rock approached, to spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If there Angelica concealed might lie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As where low junipers o’er shade her lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or in the stubble of the open lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the hunters seek the fearful hare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through traversed woods, and through uncertain way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Lest peradventure she be hidden there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They every bramble, every bush assay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even so, where hope the toiling warrior leads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searching his lady-love, Orlando speeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pricking in haste towards that ray, the count</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived where in the wood the light was shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth-streaming from a crevice in the mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within whose womb a spacious grotto spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, like wall or bank, discerned in front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of thorns and underwood a bristly bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hide the grotto’s inmates, and defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From scathe or scorn, which others might intend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By day it had been hidden evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the clear flame betrayed the haunt by night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its use he guessed; but would the place explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better certify himself by sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he without had tied his Brigliador,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In silence to the grotto stole the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threading the shrubs; nor calling for a guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entered the passage in the mountain’s side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By a long flight of steps was the descent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the cave; where, in the rocky tomb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Buried were living folk. Of wide extent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The grot was chiselled into vaulted room;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was, although its entrance little lent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All daylight wanting to disperse the gloom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For much was furnished by a window dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within a natural fissure on the right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the mid cave, beside a fire was seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A gentle maid of pleasing look and guise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seemed to Roland little past fifteen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As far as at first sight he might surmise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that so fair she made the rugged scene</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seem in the warrior’s sight a paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although this while her eyes with tears o’erflow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clear tokens of a heart oppressed with woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An aged dame was with her, and the pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wrangled, as oftentimes is women’s way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the County was descending there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concluded the dispute and wordy fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando hastens to salute them fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As still is due to womankind), and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To welcome him rise lightly form their seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with benign return the warrior greet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis true, that when that sudden voice they hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Somedeal confused in look they seem to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the same time beholding thus appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fierce a wight, and harnessed cap-a-pee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What wight” (demands Anglantes’ cavalier)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“So barbarous is, and void of courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he keeps buried, in this rude repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A face so gentle and so passing fair?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With pain the virgin to the count replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he inquires of her unhappy doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sweet and broken accents, which by sighs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impelled, through rows of pearl and coral come:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And between rose and lily, from her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tears fall so fast, she needs must swallow some.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other canto, sir, be pleased to attend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest, for here ’tis time my strain should end.</span>

				<span>Those ancient cavaliers right happy were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Born in an age, when, in the gloomy wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In valley, and in cave, wherein the bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpent, or lion, hid their savage brood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They could find that, which now in palace rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is hardly found by judges proved and good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Women, to wit, who in their freshest days</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of beauty worthily deserve the praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above I told you how a gentle maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando had discovered under ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And asked, “by whom she thither was conveyed?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursuing now my tale, I tell, how drowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In grief (her speech by many a sob delayed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel fair, in sweet and softest sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Summing them with what brevity she might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her ills recounted to Anglantes’ knight.</span>

				<span class="i1">Hence, led by spreading rumour to our town,</span>

				<span class="i1">To joust, from different lands came many a knight;</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Performing wondrous feats of chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I was surprised by Love, ere I descried</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, following in my Love, so rash a guide,</span>

			<p>
				<span>“At the time fixed to bear me thence away,</span>

				<span class="i1">—And thus it was arrived the wished-for day,</span>

				<span class="i1">Of valiant men, by land and sea renowned,</span>

				<span>“Sir Odoric in war well taught and bred,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love lent to him (unless I am misled)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pinions, that he might overtake his prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many a prayer and glozing flattery taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith I to compliance might be wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But all in vain, for I was fixed and bent,</span>

				<span class="i1">Rather than sate his ill desire, to die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When menace had by him been vainly spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every prayer and every flattery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would by open force his will content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor boots it aught that I entreaties try;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his lord’s faith in him the wretch remind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how myself I to his hands resigned.</span>

				<span class="i1">Which might have well been heard a league around,</span>

				<span>Then to the county cried; “I never knew</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another head or arm, or leg and thigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence some were slain outright, and maimed the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he who was least injured sought to fly.</span>

				<span class="i1">’Tis so sometimes, with heavy stone oppressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A knot of slimy snakes is seen to lie,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor chain and crook for such a deed did crave:</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laments, and plucks the hair from off her head,</span>

				<span class="i1">By fear impelled, through paths which sore offend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her feet, till she, beside a river’s bed,</span>

				<span class="i1">Praying he would not leave her there alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vowed to follow whither he would guide.</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">—Of Aymon’s daughter⁠—whom I left above,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The time long past, she, lying in that place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had hoped that her Rogero would appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, not beholding him in all that space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many evil chances lived in fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One day, mid others that her woeful case</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady wept alone, to her drew near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame, who with that healing ring made sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bosom rankling with Alcina’s wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When her she saw, without her love returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such time elapsed, her mission incomplete),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore trembling, faint, and pale, her heart so yearned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She scarce had strength to stand upon her feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the enchantress kind, when she discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her fear, advanced with smiles the maid to meet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to console her such glad visage wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As messenger who joyful tidings bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fear not for thy Rogero; he is well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And safe (she cried), and ever worships thee,</span>

				<span class="i1">As wonted; but thy foe, that wizard fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him yet again deprives of liberty.</span>

				<span class="i1">And it behoves thee now to climb the sell,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were to attempt a sea without a shore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When of the larger portion of her seed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king enchantress at full ease had told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft and oft rehearsed, amid the rede,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What arts Rogero to the wizard’s hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had drawn, Melissa halted near the mead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where stood the mansion of Atlantes old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would approach the magic dome more nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest her the false magician should espy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yet again advised the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Counsel she had a thousand times bestowed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then left, Nor Bradamant through greenwood shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than two miles in narrow path had rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before, by two fierce giants overlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw a knight, who like Rogero showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So closely pressed, and labouring sore for breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he appeared well nigh reduced to death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she beheld him in such perilous strait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of Rogero all the tokens wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She quickly lost the faith she nourished late,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly her every fair design forbore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She weens Melissa bears Rogero hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For some new injury unheard before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with unheard of hate and wrong, her foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would by her hand destroy who loves him so.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She cried, “And is not this Rogero, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye present to my heart, is now to sight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ’tis not him whom I agnize and view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom e’er shall I agnize or view aright?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why should I other’s judgment deem more true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the belief that’s warranted by sight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even without eyes, and by my heart alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he were near or distant, would be shown.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While so the damsel thinks, a voice she hears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, like Rogero’s, seems for aid to cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the same time, the worsted knight appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slack the bridle and the rowels ply:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While at full speed the goaded courser clears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His ground, pursued by either enemy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor paused the dame, in following them who sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His life, till to the enchanted palace brought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of which no sooner has she past the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than she is cheated by the common show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each crooked way or straight her feet explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within it and without, above, below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor rests she night or day, so strong the lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the enchanter, who has ordered so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She (though they still encounter and confer)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows not Rogero, nor Rogero her.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But leave we Bradamant, nor grieve, O ye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hear, that she is prisoned by the spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since her in fitting time I shall set free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good Rogero, from the dome as well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As taste is quickened by variety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So it appears that, in the things I tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wider here and there my story ranges,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It will be found less tedious for its changes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meseems that I have many threads to clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the great web I labour evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And therefore be ye not displeased to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How, all dislodged, the squadrons of the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threatening the golden lines loud, appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms, the royal Agramant before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bids for a review his army post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Willing to know the numbers of his host.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For besides horse and foot, in the campaign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore thinned, whose numbers were to be supplied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had many captains, and those good, of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Libya, and of Aethiopia, died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus the nations, and the various train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wandered without a ruler or a guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give to each its head and order due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ample camp is mustered in review.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To fill the squadrons ravaged by the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In those fierce battles and those conflicts dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> to his Spain, to his Africa <em>that</em> lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent to recruit, where well their files they fed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next distributed the paynim horde</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under their proper captains, ranged and led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, with your leave, till other strain, delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The order of the muster to display.</span>

			<p>
				<span>In many a fierce assault and conflict dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt Spain and Afric and their Gallic foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Countless had been the slain, whose bodies fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ravening eagle, wolf, and greedy crow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But though the Franks had worse in warfare sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forced all the champaigne country to forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This had the paynims purchased at the cost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of more good princes and bold barons lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So bloody was the price of victory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small ground was left them triumphs to prepare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if, unconquered Duke Alphonso,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-178" id="noteref-178" epub:type="noteref">178</a> we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May modern things with ancient deeds compare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The battle, whose illustrious palm may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well worthily assigned to you to wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At whose remembrance sad Ravenna trembles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And aye shall weep her loss, this field resembles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the Calesians and the Picards yielding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And troops of Normandy and Aquitaine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You, with your valiant arms their squadrons shielding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stormed the almost victorious flags of Spain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those bold youths their trenchant weapons wielding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through parted squadrons, followed in your train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on that day deserved you should accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For honoured gifts, the gilded spur and sword.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-179" id="noteref-179" epub:type="noteref">179</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You, with such glorious hearts, who were not slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow, nor far off, the gorgeous oak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seized, and shook down the golden acorns so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so the red and yellow truncheon broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we to you our festive laurels owe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the fair lily, rescued from its stroke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another wreath may round your temples bloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that Fabricius you preserved to Rome.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-180" id="noteref-180" epub:type="noteref">180</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rome’s mighty column, by your valiant hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taken and kept entire,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-181" id="noteref-181" epub:type="noteref">181</a> more praise has shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On you, than if the predatory band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had routed by your single valour bled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all who flocked to fat Ravenna’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or masterless, without a banner fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Arragon, Castile, or of Navarre;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When vain was lance or cannon’s thundering car.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This dear-bought victory brought more relief</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than joy, by its event too much outweighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loss of that French captain and our chief,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-182" id="noteref-182" epub:type="noteref">182</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom dead we on the fatal field surveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And swallowed in one storm, for further grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many glorious princes, who, arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For safeguard of their own, or neighbouring lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had poured through frozen Alps their friendly bands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Our present safety, and life held in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We see assured us by this victory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That saved us from the wintry tempest drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which would have whelmed us from Jove’s angry sky.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-183" id="noteref-183" epub:type="noteref">183</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ill can we rejoice, while yet the tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is standing in full many a widow’s eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who weeping and attired in sable, vents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout all grieving France, her loud laments.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis meet King Lewis should find new supplies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of chiefs by whom his troops may be arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for the lilies’ honour shall chastise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hands which so rapaciously have preyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who brethren, black and white, in shameful wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have outraged, sister, mother, wife, and maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cast on earth Christ’s sacrament divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the intent to thieve his silver shrine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hadst thou not made resistance to thy foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better, Ravenna, had it been for thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou been warned by Brescia’s fate, than so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine should Faenza warn and Rimini.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O Lewis, bid good old Trivulzio go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thine, and to thy bands example be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tell what ills such license still has bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaping our ample Italy with dead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-184" id="noteref-184" epub:type="noteref">184</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the illustrious King of France has need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of captains to supply his leaders lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the two kings who Spain and Afric lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give new order to the double host,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A guide and government to every band.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Doriphoebus, muster in the van;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next, without their monarch Fulvirant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erst killed by good Rinaldo, comes the clan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of bold Navarre; whose guideless band to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The King of Spain appoints Sir Isolier.</span>

				<span class="i1">They follow Madarasso’s gonfalon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who have left Malaga and fair Seville,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt fruitful Cordova and Cadiz-bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where through green banks the Betis winds its way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stordilane, Tessira, and Baricond,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After each other, next their forces stirred;</span>

				<span class="i1">Who erst with Sinnagon’s broad banner spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marched, and the multitude who drink and lave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their limbs in crystal Guadiana’s bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came thither, under Matalista brave;</span>

				<span class="i1">And Saragossa’s men, Ferraù commands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in this force, well-sheathed in mail and plate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Malgarine and Balinverno stands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Morgant and Malzarise, whom common fate</span>

				<span class="i1">Had both condemned to dwell in foreign lands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when dethroned, had to Marsilius’ court</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(There hospitably harboured) made resort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Follicon, Kind Marsilius’ bastard, hies</span>

				<span class="i1">In fair review before King Agramant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared King Oran with his martial train,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although King Agramant has little store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of chiefs, he feigns a choice, and thinks; next speeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Buraldo, Ormida, and Arganio tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where needing, the unordered troops to guide.</span>

				<span class="i1">(Nigh where Atlantes dwelt), to her he led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair Bradamant, had lost the virtuous ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had lived in the displeasure of his king;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And but that Ferraù’s brother Isolier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fastened to a stem had found him there,</span>

				<span class="i1">Made to King Agramant the truth appear,</span>

				<span class="i1">Already fastened was the noose, and near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The caitiff’s fate, when at the many’s prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king bade loose him; but reprieving, swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For his first fault to hang, offending more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus, not without a cause, Brunello pined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And showed a mournful face, and hung his head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next Farurantes: to whose care consigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Maurina’s valiant horse and footmen tread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The new-made king Libanio comes behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom are Constatina’s people led:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Agramant the crown and staff of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once Pinador’s, had given to him to hold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hesperia’s people come with Soridan,</span>

				<span class="i1">With Dorilon the men of Setta ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Nasamonians troop with Pulian,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Malabupherso rules o’er Fezzan’s clan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Finaduro leads the band supplied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the Canary Islands and Morocco:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Balastro fills the place of king Tardocco.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next Mulga and Arzilla’s legions two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first beneath their ancient captains wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The second troop without a leader, who</span>

				<span class="i1">To a new monarch in Caïchus bend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Goetulia is bestowed on Rhimedont,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ruled by Clarindo, Bolga’s people go,</span>

				<span class="i1">Who fills the valiant Mirabaldo’s post:</span>

				<span class="i1">Him Baliverso, whom I’d have you know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the worst ribald in that ample host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Succeeded next. I think not, ’mid that show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bannered camp a firmer troop could boast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that which followed in Sobrino’s care;</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor Saracen than him more wise and ware.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gualciotto dead, Bellamarina’s crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(His vassals) serve, the sovereign of Algiers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont, of Sarza; that anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought up a band of foot and cavaliers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom, when the cloudy sun his rays withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the Centaur and the Goat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-186" id="noteref-186" epub:type="noteref">186</a> his spears</span>

				<span class="i1">There to recruit, was sent to the Afric shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Agramant, returned three days before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There was no Saracen of bolder strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the chiefs who Moorish squadrons led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Paris-town (nor is the terror vain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More of the puissant warrior stands in dread</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he, or the renowned Marsilius head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And amid all that mighty muster, more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than others, hatred to our faith he bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Prusion is the Alvaracchia’s king: below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Dardinello’s flag Zumara’s power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is ranged. I wot not, I, if owl or crow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or other bird ill-omened, which from tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or tree croaks future evil, did foreshow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To one or to the other, that the hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was fixed in heaven, when on the following day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Either should perish in this deadly fray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Noritia’s men and Tremisene’s alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were wanting to complete the paynim host;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in the martial muster sign was none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor tale, nor tiding of the squadrons lost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wondering Agramant alike unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What kept the slothful warriors from their post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When of King Tremisene’s a squire was brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before him, who at large the mischief taught;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—Who taught how Manilardo was laid low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alzirdo, and many others, on the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Sir,” said the bearer of the news, “the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who slew our troop, would all thy camp have slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thine assembled host had been more slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than me, who, as it was, escaped with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This man slays horse and foot, as in the cote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wolf makes easy waste of sheep and goat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where the bold Africans their standards plant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A warrior had arrived some days before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was there in the west, or whole Levant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A knight, with heart or prowess gifted more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him much grace was done by Agramant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As successor of Agrican, who wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crown of Tartary, a warrior wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The son the famous Mandricardo hight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Renowned he was for many a glorious quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achieved, and through the world his fame was blown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him had glorified above the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worth in the Syrian fairy’s castle shown:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-187" id="noteref-187" epub:type="noteref">187</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where mail, which cased the Trojan Hector’s breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand years before, he made his own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finished that adventure, strange and fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A story which breeds terror but to tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the squire told his news amid that show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of troops, was present Agrican’s bold son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who raised his daring face, resolved to go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And find the warrior who the deed had done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the design he hatched, forebore to show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As making small account of any one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or fearing lest, should he reveal his thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The quest by other champion might be sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He of the squire demanded what the vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bearings, which the valiant stranger wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who answered, “that he went without a crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sable shield and sable surcoat bore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And, sir, ’twas true; for so was Roland drest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The old device renounced he had before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For as he mourned within, so he without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The symbols of his grief would bear about.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marsilius had to Mandricardo sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As gift, a courser of a chestnut stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose legs and mane were sable; he was bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between a Friesland mare and nag of Spain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Mandricardo, armed from foot to head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leapt on the steed and galloped o’er the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And swore upon the camp to turn his back</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he should find the champion clad in black.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king encounters many of the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom good Orlando’s arm had put to flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And some a son, and some a brother rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in the rout had perished in their sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the coward’s cheek of pallid hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is <em>yet</em> portrayed the sad and craven sprite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—<em>Yet</em>, through the fear endured, they far and nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pallid, and silent, and insensate fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor he long was had rode, ere he descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A passing-cruel spectacle and sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But which the wonderous feats well testified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That were recounted Agramant before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now on <em>this</em> hand, now <em>that</em>, the dead he eyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Measured their wounds, and turned their bodies o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved by strange envy of the knight whose hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had strown the champaign with the slaughtered band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As wolf or mastiff-dog, who comes the last</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the remains of slaughtered bullock lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finds but horn and bones, where rich repast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had fed the ravening hound and vulture nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glares vainly on the scull, unsmacked; so passed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The barbarous Tartar king those bodies by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grudged, lamenting, like the hungry beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have come too late for such a sumptuous feast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That day, and half the next, in search he strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him who wore the sable vest and shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When lo! he saw a mead, o’ertopt with shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where a deep river wound about the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With narrow space between the turns it made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er from side to side the water wheeled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even such a spot as this with circling waves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Below Otricoli the Tyber laves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where this deep stream was fordable, he scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A crowd of cavaliers that armour bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these the paynim questioned, “Who had manned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such a troop, and to what end, the shore?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him replied the captain of the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved by his lordly air, and arms he wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glittering with gold and jewels⁠—costly gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which showed him an illustrious cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In charge” (he said) “we of the daughter go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him our king, who fills Granada’s throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Espoused by Rodomont of Sarza, though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fame the tidings are as yet unknown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we, departing when the sun is low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the cicala hushed, which now alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is heard, shall bring her where her father keeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the Spanish camp; meanwhile the lady sleeps.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He who for scorn had daffed the world aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Designs to see at once, how able were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those horsemen to defend the royal bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Committed by their sovereign to their care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The maid, by what I hear, is fair:” (he cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Fain would I now be certified, how fair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then me to her, or her to me convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I must quickly wend another way.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou needs art raving mad,” replied in few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The chief⁠—nor more. But with his lance in rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar monarch at the speaker flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the levelled spear transfixed his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the point pierced the yielding corslet through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lifeless he, perforce, the champaign prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The son of Agrican his lance regained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who weaponless without the spear remained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now sword nor club the warlike Tartar bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, when the Trojan Hector’s plate and chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gained, because the faulchion lacked, he swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(To this obliged), nor swore the king in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That save he won the blade Orlando wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would no other grasp⁠—that Durindane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Held in high value by Almontes bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Roland bears, and Hector bore of old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Great is the Tartar monarch’s daring, those</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At such a disadvantage to assay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He pricks, with levelled lance, among his foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shouting, in fury⁠—“Who shall bar my way?”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round and about him suddenly they close;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These draw the faulchion, and those others lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spear in rest: a multitude he slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before his lance was broke upon the crew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When this he saw was broke, the truncheon sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet entire, he took, both hands between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with so many bodies strewed the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That direr havoc never yet was seen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as with that jaw-bone, by hazard found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Hebrew Samson slew the Philistines,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crushed helm and shield; and often side by side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slain by the truncheon, horse and rider died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In running to their death the wretches vie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor cease because their comrades perish near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet bitterer in such a mode to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than death itself, does to the troop appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They grudge to forfeit precious life, and lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crushed by the fragment of a broken spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And think foul scorn beneath the pounding stake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strangely to die the death of frog or snake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But after they at their expense had read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it was ill to die in any way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And near two thirds were now already dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest began to fly in disarray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if with what was his the vanquished fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cruel paynim, cheated of his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill bore that any, from the murderous strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that scared rabble, should escape with life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in the well-dried fen or stubble-land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short time the stalk endures, or stridulous reed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the flames, which careful rustic’s hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatters when Boreas blows the fires to feed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time they take, and by the north-wind fanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crackle and snap, and through the furrow speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No otherwise, with little profit, those</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Mandricardo’s kindled wrath oppose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When afterwards he marks the entrance free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left ill-secured, and without sentinel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, following prints (which had been recently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marked on the mead), proceeds, amid the swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of loud laments, Granada’s dame to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she as beauteous were as what they tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wound his way ’mid corpses, where the wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Winding from side to side, a passage gave:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in the middle of the mead surveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doralice (such the gentle lady’s name),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-188" id="noteref-188" epub:type="noteref">188</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, at the root of an old ash-tree laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bemoaned her: fast her lamentations came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tears, like plenteous vein of water, strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the beauteous bosom of the dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, (so it from her lovely face appeared,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For others mourned, while for herself she feared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her fear increased when she approaching spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him foul with blood, and marked his felon cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And piercing shrieks the very sky divide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised by herself and followers, in their fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For over and above the troop who guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fair infanta, squire and cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came ancient men and matrons in her train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And maids, the fairest of Granada’s reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that fair face by him of Tartary</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is seen, which has no paragon in Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where amid tears (in laughter what were she?)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is twisted Love’s inextricable chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knows not if in heaven or earth he be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from his victory reaps other gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than yielding up himself a thrall to her,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He knows not why) who was his prisoner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet not so far his courtesy he strained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he would lose his labour’s fruit, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The royal damsel showed, who sorely plained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such grief as women in despair can show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, who the hope within him entertained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To turn to sovereign joy her present woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would wholly bear her off; whom having placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a white jennet, he his way retraced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He dames, maids, ancient men, and others, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had from Granada with the damsel fared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kindly dismissed, their journey to pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saying, “My care suffices; I of guard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of guide, of handmaid will the office do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To serve her in her every need prepared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Farewell!” and thus unable to withstand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wrong, with tears and sighs withdrew the band,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saying, “How woe-begone will be her sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he the miserable case shall hear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What grief will be the bridegroom’s! what his ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How dread the vengeance of that cavalier!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When so the lady’s needs such help require,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! and why is not the champion near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save the illustrious blood of Stordilane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere the thief bears her farther hence, from stain?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Tartar, joying in the prize possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he by chance and valour won and wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find the warrior of the sable vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed not to have the haste he had before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stopp’d and loitered, where he whilom prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cast about and studied evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find some fitting shelter; with desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In quiet to exhale such amorous fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Doralice he consoled this while, whose eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cheek were wetted with the frequent tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many matters feigned and flattering lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How, known by fame, he long had held her dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how his country and glad realm, whose size</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shamed others, praised for grandeur far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He quitted, not for sight of France or Spain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to behold that cheek of lovely grain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If a man merits love by loving, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yours by my love deserve; if it is won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By birth⁠—who boasts a genealogy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like me, the puissant Agricano’s son?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By riches⁠—who with me in wealth can vie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in dominion yield to God alone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By courage⁠—I to-day (I ween) have proved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I for courage merit to be loved.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These words, and many others on his part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love frames and dictates to the Tartar knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sweetly tend to cheer the afflicted heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the unhappy maid, disturbed with fright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By these fear first was laid, and next the smart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sheathed of that woe, which had nigh pierced her sprite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with more patience thence the maid began</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear, and her new lover’s reasons scan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next much more affable, with courteous lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seasoning her answers to his suit, replies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor looking at the king, sometimes forbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fix upon his face her pitying eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim thence, whom Love had smote before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not hopeful now, but certain, of his prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed that the lovely damsel would not still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As late, be found rebellious to his will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Riding in her glad company afield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which so rejoiced his soul, so satisfied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And being near the time, when to their bield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Warned by the chilly night, all creatures hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing the sun now low and half concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior ’gan in greater hurry ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he heard reed-pipe and whistle sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next saw farm and cabin smoking round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pastoral lodgings were the dwellings near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less formed for show, than for conveniency;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the young damsel and the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The herdsman welcomed with such courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That both were pleasured by his kindly cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For not alone dwells Hospitality</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In court and city; but ofttimes we find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In loft and cottage men of gentle kind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What afterwards was done at close of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between the damsel and the Tartar lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will not take upon myself to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So leave to each, at pleasure, to award.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But as they rose the following morn more gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It would appear they were of fair accord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the swain who them such honour showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her thanks at parting Doralice bestowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence from one place to the other wandering, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Find themselves by a river, as they go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the sea in silence winds its way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ill could be pronounced to stand or flow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So clear and limpid, that the cheerful day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With nought to intercept it, pierced below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon its bank, beneath a cooling shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They found two warriors and a damsel laid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now lofty Fancy, which one course to run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Permits not, calls me hence in sudden wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither I return, where paynims stun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair France with hosile din and angry cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the tent, wherein Troyano’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They holy empire in his wrath defies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And boastful Rodomont, with vengeful doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gives Paris to the flames, and levels Rome.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tidings had reached the Moorish sovereign’s ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the English had already passed the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he bade Garbo’s aged king appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marsilius, and his heads of chivalry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who all advised the monarch to prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the assault of Paris. “They may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assured they in the storm will never thrive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless ’tis made before the aids arrive.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Innumerable ladders for the scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been collected upon every hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plank and beam, and hurdle’s twisted mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For different uses, at the king’s command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bridge and boat; and, what might more avail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all the rest, a first and second band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the assault (so bids the monarch) form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will himself go forth with them that storm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The emperor, on the vigil of the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of battle, within Paris, everywhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By priest and friar of orders black and gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And white, bade celebrate mass-rite and prayer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those who had confessed, a fair array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the Stygian demons rescued were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Communicated in such fashions, all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if they were the ensuing day to fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the high church, he, girt with paladine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And preachers of the word, and barons brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With much devotion at those acts divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assisted, and a fair example gave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there with folded hands and face supine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed, “O Lord! although my sins be grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Permit not, that, in this their utmost need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy people suffer for their king’s misdeed!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if that they should suffer is thy will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that they should due penance undergo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least delay thy purpose to fulfil!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that thine enemies deal not the blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, when ’tis given him in his wrath to kill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Us who are deemed thy friends, the paynim foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou art without power to save, will cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because thou lett’st thy faithful people die:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, for one faithless found, against thy sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred shall throughout the world rebel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that false Babel’s law will have its way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus thy blessed faith put down and quell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defend thy suffering people, who are they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That purged thy tomb from heathen hounds and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many times and oft, by foes offended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy holy church and vicars have defended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That our deserts unfitting are to place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the scale against our mighty debt, I know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor pardon can we hope, if we retrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our sinful lives; but if thou shouldst bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In aid, the gift of they redeeming grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The account is quit and balanced, that we owe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can we of thy succour, Lord, despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While we in mind thy saving mercy bear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the holy emperor aloud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In humbleness of heart and deep contrition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And added other prayers withal, and vowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What fitted his great needs and high condition.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now was his supplication disallowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For his good genius hears the king’s petition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Best of the seraphs he; who spreads his wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the Saviour’s feet this offering brings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Infinite other prayers as well preferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were, by like couriers, to the Godhead’s ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So borne; which when the blessed spirits heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They all together gazed, with pitying cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On their eternal, loving Lord, and, stirred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With one desire, besought that he would hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The just petition, to his ears conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this his Christian people, seeking aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And the ineffable Goodness, who in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never sought by faithful heart, an eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full of compassion, raised; and from the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waved Michael, and to the archangel: “Hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek the Christian host that crost the main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lately furled their sails in Picardy:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These so conduct to Paris, that their tramp</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And noise be heard not in the hostile camp.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Find Silence first, and bid him, on my part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this emprize attend thee, at thy side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he for such a quest, with happiest art</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will know what is most fitting to provide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, where she sojourns, instantly impart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Discord my command, that she, supplied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With steel and tinder, ’mid the paynims go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fire and flame in their encampment blow;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And throughout those among them, who are said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be the mightiest, spread such strife, that they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together may contend, and that some dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remain, some hurt, some taken in the fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And some to leave the camp, by wrath, be led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they yield their sovereign little stay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing the blessed winged-one replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But swoops descending from the starry skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where’er the angel Michael turns his wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The clouds are scattered and the sky turns bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About his person forms a golden ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As we see summer lightning gleam at night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while the courier of the heavenly king</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinks, on his way, where he may best alight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the intent to find that foe to speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom he first his high behest would teach.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the thought the posting angel brooded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he, for whom he sought was used to dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who after thinking much, at last concluded</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him he should find in church or convent-cell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where social speech is in such mode excluded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That <b>Silence</b>, where the cloistered brethren swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their anthems, where they sleep, and where they sit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At meat; and everywhere in fine is writ.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Weening that he shall find him here, he plies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With greater speed his plumes of gilded scale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deems as well that Peace, here guested, lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Charity and Quiet, without fail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But finds he is deceived in his surmise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as he has past the cloister’s pale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Silence is not; nor (’tis said) is found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Longer, except in writing, on this ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor here he Love, nor here he Peace surveys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Piety, Quiet, or Humility.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here dwelt they once; but ’twas in ancient days;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chased hence by Avarice, Anger, Gluttony,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pride, Envy, Sloth, and Cruelty. In amaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The angel mused upon such novelty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He narrowly the hideous squadron eyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Discord too amid the rest espied;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even her, to whom the eternal Sire as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having found Silence, bade him to repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had believed he to Avernus’ cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she was harboured with the damned, must fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now discerned her in this other hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Who would believe it?) amid mass and prayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strange Michael thought to see her there enshrined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he believed he must go far to find.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her by her parti-coloured vest he knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unequal strips and many formed the gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, opening with her walk, or wind that blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now showed, now hid her; for they were unsown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hair appeared to be at strife; in hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like silver and like gold, and black and brown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Part in a tress, in riband part comprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some on her shoulders flowed, some on her breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Examinations, summons, and a store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of writs and letters of attorney, she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hearings, in her hands and bosom bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And consultation, and authority:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weapons, from which the substance of the poor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can never safe in walled city be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before, behind her, and about her, wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Attorney, notary, and advocate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her Michael calls to him, and give command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That she among the strongest paynims go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And find occasion whence amid the band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Warfare and memorable scathe may grow.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He next from her of Silence makes demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of his motions easily might know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one who from one land to the other hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kindling and scattering fire on either side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I recollect not ever to have viewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him anywhere,” quoth Discord in reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But oft have heard him mentioned, and for shrewd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greatly commended by the general cry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Fraud, who makes one of this multitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who has sometimes kept him company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I think, can furnish news of him to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (pointing with her finger) <em>that is she</em>.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With pleasing mien, grave walk, and decent vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fraud rolled her eyeballs humbly in her head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such benign and modest speech possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She might a Gabriel seem who Ave said.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-189" id="noteref-189" epub:type="noteref">189</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foul was she and deformed, in all the rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with a mantle long and widely spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed her hideous parts; and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the stole a poisoned dagger wore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of her the good archangel made demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What way in search of Silence to pursue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who said; “He with the Virtues once was scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor dwelt elsewhere; aye guested by the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Benedict, or blest Elias’ band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When abbeys and when convent-cells were new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whilom in the schools long time did pass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sage Archytas and Pythagorus.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But those philosophers and saints of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguished, who had been his former stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the good habits he had used before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He passed to evil ones; began to stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changing his life, at night with lovers, bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thieves company, and sinned in every way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He oftentimes consorts with Treason; further,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I even have beheld him leagued with Murther.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With coiners him you oftentimes may see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harbour in some obscure and close repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So oft he changes home and company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To light on him would be a fortune rare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet have I hope to point him out to thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If to Sleep’s house thou wilt at midnight fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him wilt thou surely find; for to repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At night he ever to that harbour goes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though Fraud was alway wont to deal in lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So like the simple truth appears her say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The angel yields the tale belief; and flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth from the monastery without delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tempers his speed, and schemes withal in wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To finish at the appointed time his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That at the house of Sleep (the mansion blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full well he knew) this Silence he may find.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In blest Arabia lies a pleasant vale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Removed from village and from city’s reach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By two fair hills o’ershadowed is the dale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And full of ancient fir and sturdy beech.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither the circling sun without avail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conveys the cheerful daylight: for no breach</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rays can make through boughs spread thickly round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it is here a cave runs under ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beneath the shadow of this forest deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the rock there runs a grotto wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here widely wandering, ivy-suckers creep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the cavern’s entrance multiplied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harboured within this grot lies heavy Sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ease, corpulent and gross, upon <em>this</em> side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon <em>that</em>, Sloth, on earth has made her seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cannot go, and hardly keeps her feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mindless Oblivion at the gate is found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lets none enter, and agnizes none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor message hears or bears, and from that ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without distinction chases every one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Silence plays the scout and walks his round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equipt with shoes of felt and mantle brown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And motions from a distance all who meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him on his circuit, from the dim retreat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The angel him approaches quietly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, “ ’Tis God’s bidding” (whispers in his ear)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That thou Rinaldo and his company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought in his sovereign’s aid, to Paris steer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that thou do the deed so silently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That not a Saracen their cry shall hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that their army come upon the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he from Fame of their arrival know.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Silence to him no otherwise replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than signing with his head that he obeyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And took his post behind the heavenly guide)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both at one flight to Picardy conveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The angel moved those bands of valour tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And short to them a tedious distance made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he to Paris safe transports; while none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is conscious that a miracle is done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Silence the advancing troop kept skirting round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In front, and flank, and rear of the array;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above the band he spread a mist profound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And everywhere beside ’twas lightsome day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor through the impeding fog the shrilling sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of horn was heard, without, or trumpet’s bray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He next the hostile paynims went to find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with I know not what made deaf and blind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While with such haste his band Rinaldo led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That him an angel well might seem to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in such silence moved, that nought was said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or heard of this upon the paynim side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant his infantry had spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout fair Paris’ suburbs, and beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foss, and underneath the walls; that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make upon the place his worst assay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He who the Moorish monarch’s force would tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Charlemagne this day will have to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In wooded Apennine might count as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The trees upon its back, or waves that beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(What time the troubled waters highest swell)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the Mauritanian Atlas’ feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or watch at midnight with how many eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The furtive works of lovers Heaven espies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The larum-bells, loud-sounding through the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stricken with frequent blows, the town affray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the crowded temples every where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Movement of lips and hands upraised to pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are seen: if treasure seemed to God so fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to our foolish thoughts, upon this day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy consistory had bid mould</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their every statue upon earth in gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lamenting may be heard the aged just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that they were reserved for such a woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calling those happy that in sacred dust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were buried many and many a year ago.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the bold youths who, valiant and robust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small thought upon the approaching ills bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scorning their elders’ counsel, here and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurrying, in fury, to the walls repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here might you paladin and baron ken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King, duke, and marquis, count and chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And soldier, foreigner or citizen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ready for honour and for Christ to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, eager to assail the Saracen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Charlemagne to lower the bridges cry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He witnesses with joy their martial heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to permit their sally deems not meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And them he ordered in convenient post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The advance of the barbarians to impede:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For <em>this</em> would ill suffice a numerous host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To <em>that</em> he was content that few should speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some worked at the machines, some wildfire tost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All ranged according to the separate need.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles, never in one place, with restless care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Provides defence and succour every where.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Paris is seated on a spacious plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the midst⁠—the heart of France, more justly say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stream flows into it, and forth again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first, the passing waters, as they stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An island form, and so secure the main</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better part, dividing on their way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other two (three separate quarters note),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the river girds, without the moat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The town, whose walls for miles in circuit run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might well have been attacked from many a side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, for he would assail it but on one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor willingly his scattered troops divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Westward beyond the stream Troyano’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Retired, from thence the assailing bands to guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, he neither city had nor plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind, but what was his, as far as Spain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where’er the walls of Paris wound about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Large ammunition had king Charles purveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strengthening with dyke each quarter held in doubt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had within trench, drain, and casemate made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where the river entered and went out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had thickest chains across the channel laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But most of all, his prudent cares appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where there is greatest cause for present fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With eyes of Argus, Pepin’s valiant son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Agramant was bent to storm foresaw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every thing forestalled, ere yet begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the bold followers of Mahound’s law.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Isolier, Grandonio, Falsiron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpentin, Balugantes, and Ferraù,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what beside he out of Spain had led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marsilius was in arms, their valiant head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With old Sobrino, on the left of Seine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pulian and Dardinel d’Almontes meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Oran’s giant king, to swell the train:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six cubits is the prince, from head to feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But why move I my pen with greater pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than these men move their arms? for in his heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont exclaims, blaspheming sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can contain his furious spirit more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As swarming to assail the pastoral bowl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sound of stridulous wing, through summer sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or relics of a feast, their luscious dole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repair the ready numbers of the fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As starlings to the vineyard’s crimsoning pole</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the ripe clusters charged⁠—heaven’s concave high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filling, as they advanced, with noise and shout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast hurried to the storm the Moorish rout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon their walls the Christians in array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lance, sword, axe, and wildfire tost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The assaulted city guard without dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And little reck the proud barbarian’s boast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor when death snatches this or that away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does any one in fear refuse his post.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the fosse below the paynim foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return, amid a storm of strokes and blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor in this was is iron plied alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But mighty masses and whole bulwarks fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And top of tower, huge piece of bastion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with much toil disrupted, solid wall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While streams of boiling water pouring down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Insufferably the advancing paynims gall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An ill-resisted rain, which, in despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of helmet, makes its way, and blinds the sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this than iron spear offended more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then how much more the mist of lime-dust fine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then how the emptied vessel, burning sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With nitre, sulphur, pitch, and turpentine!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor idle lie the fiery hoops in store,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-190" id="noteref-190" epub:type="noteref">190</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, wreathed about with flaming tresses, shine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These at the foemen scaled, upon all hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Form cruel garlands for the paynim bands,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile, up to the walls the second crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fierce Sarza’s king was driven, accompanied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By bold Orlando and Buraldo, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Garamantes and Marmonda guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clarindo and Loridano; nor from view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems, will Setta’s valiant monarch hide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Morocco’s king and he of Cosco go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these, that men their martial worth may know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With crimson Rodomont his banner stains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the vermeil field a lion shows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, bitted by a maid, to curb and reins</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His savage mouth disdains not to unclose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself in the submissive lion feigns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The haughty Rodomont, and would suppose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her who curbs him with the bit and string,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doralice, daughter to Grenada’s king;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whom Mandricardo took, as I before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Related, and from whom, and in what wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even she it was, whom Sarza’s monarch more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loved than his realm⁠—beyond his very eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And valour showed for her and courteous lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not knowing yet she was another’s prize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he had⁠—then⁠—then, first⁠—the story known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even what he did that day, he would have done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At once the foes a thousand ladders rear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the wall by the assailants shored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two mannered each round; the second, in the rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Urged on by the first; the third the second gored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One mounts the wall through valour, one through fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all attempt perforce the dangerous ford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For cruel Rodomont, of Argier, slays</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or smites the wretched laggard who delays.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis thus, ’mid fire and ruin, all assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mount the wall; but others to assure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Themselves, some safer passage seek, where they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will have least pain and peril to endure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont only scorns by any way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wend, except by what is least secure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in that desperate case, where others made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their offerings, cursed the god to whom they prayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He in a cuirass, hard and strong, was drest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A dragon-skin it was with scaly quilt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which erst secured the manly back and breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his bold ancestor, that Babel built;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hoped the rule of heaven from God to wrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him would from his golden dome have split.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perfect, and for this end alone, were made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Helmet and shield as well as trenchant blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor Rodomont to Nimrod yields in might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proud and untamed; and who would not forbear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scale the lofty firmament till night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could he in this wide world descry the stair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stood not, he, to mark the bulwark’s plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor if the fosse of certain bottom were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He past, ran⁠—rather flew across the moat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunging in filth and water to his throat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dripping and foul with water and with weeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid fire and stone, and arbalests, and bows,</span>

				<span class="i1">Here the Parisians make no further head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who find their first defence of small avail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full well they know that danger more to dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within awaits the foemen who assail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because between the wall and second mound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fosse descends, wide, horrid, and profound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Besides, that ours, with those upon the height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">War from below, like valiant men and stout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">New files succeed to those who fall in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, on the interior summit, stand the rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who gall with lances, and a whistling flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of darts, the mighty multitude without;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many of whom, I ween, that post would shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If it were not for royal Ulien’s son.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-194" id="noteref-194" epub:type="noteref">194</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But he still heartened some, and chid the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And forced them forward to their sore alarm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One paynim’s head he cleft, and other’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who turned about to fly; and of the swarm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some shoved and pushed and to the encounter prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Close-grappled by the collar, hair, or arm:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And downwards from the wall such numbers threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ditch was all to narrow for the crew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While so the foes descend, or rather fling</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Themselves into the perilous profound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence by many ladders try to spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the summit of the second mound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont, as if he had a wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his every member, from the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upraised his weight, and vaulted clean across,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loaded with all his arms, the yawning fosse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The moat of thirty feet, not less, he cleared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As dexterously as leaps the greyhound fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor at his lighting louder noise was heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if he had worn felt beneath his feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He now of <em>this</em>, now <em>that</em>, the mantle sheared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As though of pewter, not of iron beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or rather of soft rind their arms had been:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So matchless was his force and sword so keen!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while, not idle, those of ours had laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Snares in the inner moat, a well-charged mine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where broom and thick fascines, all over paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With swarthy pitch, in plenty intertwine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet is not this by any eye surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though they from bank to bank that hollow line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filling the bottom well-nigh to the brink;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And countless vessels the defenders sink.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charged with salt-petre, oil, or sulphur pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and the other, or with such like gear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While ours, intent the paynims that assail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The town, should pay their daring folly dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Who from the ditch on different parts would scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The inner bulwark’s platform) when they hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The appointed signal which their comrades raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Set, at fit points, the wildfire in a blaze.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For that the moat was full from side to side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The scattered flames united into one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mounted to such height, they well-nigh dried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The watery bosom of the moon; a dun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dismal cloud above extending wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dimmed every glimpse of light, and hid the sun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fearful crash, with a continued sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like a long peal of thunder, shook the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A horrid concert, a rude harmony</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of deep lament, and yell and shriek, which came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From those poor wretches in extremity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perishing through their furious leader’s blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was heard, as in strange concord, to agree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the fierce crackling of the murderous flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more of this, no more!⁠—Here, sir, I close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My canto, hoarse, and needing short repose.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Round about Paris every where are spread</span>

					<span class="i1">The assailing hosts of Africa and Spain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Astolpho home by Logistilla sped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Binds first Caligorantes with his chain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next from Orrilo’s trunk divides the head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whom Sir Aquilant had warred in vain,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Though Conquest fruit of skill or fortune be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To conquer always is a glorious thing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis true, indeed, a bloody victory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is to a chief less honour wont to bring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that fair field is famed eternally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who wins it merits worshipping,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, saving from all harm his own, without</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loss to his followers, puts the foe to rout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You, sir, earned worthy praise, when you o’erbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lion of such might by sea, and so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did by him, where he guarded either shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Francolino to the mouth of Pò,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I, though yet again I heard him roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you were present, should my fear forego.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How fields are fitly won was then made plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For we were rescued, and your foemen slain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-195" id="noteref-195" epub:type="noteref">195</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was the Paynim little skilled to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was but daring to his proper loss;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the moat impelled his meiny, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and all perished in the burning fosse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty gulf had not contained the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that, devouring those who sought to cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them into dust the flame reduced, that room</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might be for all within the crowded tomb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of twenty thousand warriors thither sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Died nineteen thousand in the fiery pit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to the fosse descended, ill content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But so their leader willed, of little wit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguished amid such a blaze, and spent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the devouring flame the Christians lit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Rodomont, occasion of their woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exempted from the mighty mischief goes:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he to the inner bank, by foes possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across the ditch had vaulted wonderously:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he within it been, among the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It sure had been his last assault. His eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turns, and when the wildfires, which infest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The infernal vale, he sees ascend so high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hears his people’s moan and dying screams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With imprecations dread he Heaven blasphemes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while a band King Agramant had brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make a fierce assault upon a gate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For while the cruel battle here was fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein so many sufferers met their fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This haply unprovided had he thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fitting guard. Upon the monarch wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Bambirago, ’mid his knights of price,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Baliverso, sink of every vice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Corineus of Mulga, Prusion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wealthy monarch of the blessed isles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Malabuferzo, he who fills the throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Fez, where a perpetual summer smiles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other noble lords, and many a one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well-armed and tried; and others ’mid their files,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked, and base, whose hearts in martial fields</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had found no shelter from a thousand shields.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But all things counter to the hopes ensue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Agramant upon his side; within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In person, girded by a gallant crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is Charlemagne, with many a paladin:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ogier the Duke, King Salamon, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guidos are seen, and either Angelin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bavaria’s duke,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-196" id="noteref-196" epub:type="noteref">196</a> and Ganelon are here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avino, Avolio, Otho, and Berlinghier:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And of inferior count withal, a horde</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Lombards, French, and Germans, without end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, every one, in presence of his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rank among the valiantest contend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This will I in another place record;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who here a mighty duke perforce attend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who signs to me from far, and prays that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will not omit him in my history.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis time that I should measure back my way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where I Astolpho left of yore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, in long exile, loathing more to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Burnt with desire to tread his native shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As hopes to him had given the sober fay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who quelled Alcina by her better lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She with all care would send the warrior back</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the securest and the freest track.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus by her a barque is fitted out;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A better galley never ploughed the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Logistilla wills, for aye in doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hinderance from Alcina’s treachery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That good Andronica, with squadron stout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chaste Sophrosina, with him shall be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till to the Arabian Sea, beneath their care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or to the Persian Gulf he safe repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By Scyth and Indian she prefers the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should coast, and by the Nabataean reign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Content he, after such a round, should veer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Persian gulf, or Erithraean main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than for that Boreal palace steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where angry winds aye vex the rude domain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So ill, at seasons, favoured by the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That there, for months together, light is none.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next, when she all in readiness espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her license to depart the prudent fay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accorded to the duke, first fortified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With counsel as to things too long to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he might no more by charms be stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In place from whence he could not wend his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him with a useful book and fair purveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever for her love to wear it prayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How man should guard himself from magic cheats</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The book instructed, which the fay bestowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the end or the beginning, where it treats</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of such, an index and appendix showed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another gift, which in its goodly feats</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All other gifts excelled, to her he owed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was a horn, which made whatever wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should hear its clang betake himself to flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say, the horn is of such horrid sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, wheresoe’er ’tis heard, all fly for fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in the world is one of heart so sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That would not fly, should he the bugle hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wind, thunder, and the shock which rives the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come not, in aught, the hideous clangour near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thanks did the good Englishman receive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gift, and of the fairy took his leave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quitting the port and smoother waves, they stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sea, with favouring wind which blows astern;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (coasting) round the rich and populous land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of odoriferous Ind the vessels turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opening a thousand isles on either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scattered about that sea, till they discern</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The land of Thomas; here the pilot veers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His ready tiller, and more northward steers.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-197" id="noteref-197" epub:type="noteref">197</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho, furrowing that ocean hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marks, as he coasts, the wealthy land at ease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ganges amid the whitening waters roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh skirting now the golden Chersonese;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taprobana with Cori next, and sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The frith which chafes against its double shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes distant Cochin, and with favouring wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issues beyond the boundaries of Ind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-198" id="noteref-198" epub:type="noteref">198</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scouring at large broad ocean, with a guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So faithful and secure, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Questions Andronica, if from that side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Named from the westering sun, of this our sphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bark, which with oars or canvas stemmed the tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On eastern sea was wonted to appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And could a wight, who loosed from Indian strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reach France or Britain, without touching land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Andronica to England’s duke replies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Know that this earth is girt about with seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all to one another yield supplies,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, since the Aethiops’ land before us lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extending southward many long degrees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across his waters, some one has supposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A barrier here to Neptune interposed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hence bark from this Levant of Ind is none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which weighs, to shape her course for Europe’s shore;</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor navigates from Europe any one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our Oriental regions to explore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fain to retrace alike the course begun</span>

				<span class="i1">By the mid land, extending wide before:</span>

				<span class="i1">Weening (its limits of such length appear)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it must join another hemisphere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But in the course of circling years I view</span>

				<span>“And find the limit of this length of land,</span>

				<span class="i1">So showed the giant those of greatest note,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, thither brought, had perished in his snare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bones of countless others wide were spread,</span>

				<span>Caligorant was standing at the gate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For so was the despiteous monster hight);</span>

				<span class="i1">Who decked his house with corpses, as for state</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some theirs with cloth of gold and scarlet dight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He scarce contained himself for joy, so great</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His pleasure, when the duke appeared in sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’twas two months complete, a third was near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since by that road had past a cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Towards the marish, where green rushes grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hastes, intending from that covert blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To double on his unsuspecting foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issue on the cavalier behind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him to drive into the net, below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sand, the griesly giant had designed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As others trapt he had been wont to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought thither by their evil destiny.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When him the wary paladin espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stopt his courser, not without great heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest he into the covert snare might tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forewarned of this by the good hermit’s rede.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here to his horn for succour he applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor failed its wonted virtue in this need:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It smote the giant’s heart with such affright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he turned back, and homeward fled outright.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho blew, still watchful of surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weening to see the engine sprung: fast flew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The giant⁠—as if heart as well as eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thief had lost⁠—nor whitherward he knew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such is his fear, he kens not as he flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How is own covert mischief to eschew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He runs into the net, which closing round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hampers the wretch, and drags him to the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho, who beholds his bulky prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fall bodily, drives thither at full speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure himself, and, bent to make him pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The price of slaughtered thousands, quits his steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet after, deems a helpless wight to slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No valour were, but rather foul misdeed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him, arms, neck, and feet so closely tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not shake himself, the warrior spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With subtle thread of steel had Vulcan wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The net of old, and with such cunning pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, who to break its weakest mesh had sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have bestowed his time and toil in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was with this he Mars and Venus caught,</span>

				<span class="i1">Who, hands and feet, were fettered by the chain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor did the jealous husband weave the thread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For aught, but to surprise that pair in bed.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Mercury from the smith conveyed the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wanting to take young Chloris in the snare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sweet Chloris, who behind Aurora flies,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He for this nymph his toils so deftly set,</span>

				<span class="i1">One day, in air he took her with the net.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The nymph (it seems) was taken as she flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the great Aethiop river meets the brine:</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Successive ages, in Anubis’ shrine.</span>
				<br/>

			<p>
				<span>He fixed it here, beneath the sandy plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In mode, that all the travellers whom he chased</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ran into it, and the engine was with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touched, ere it arms, and feet, and neck embraced.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From this the good Astolpho took a chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the gyve his hands behind him laced:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms and breast he swaddled in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not loose himself; then let him rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After, his other knots unfastening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For he was turned more gentle than a maid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho, as a show, the thief would bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By city, borough-town, and farm conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The net as well; than which no quainter thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ever by the file and hammer made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him, like sumpter-nag he laid the load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In triumph led, behind him, on his road.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him helm and shield he gives alike to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to a valet; hence proceeds the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gladdening the fearful pilgrim every where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who joys to think, henceforth his way is clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So far an end does bold Astolpho fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is to Memphis’ tombs already near⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Memphis renowned for pyramids; in sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He marks the populous Cairo opposite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ran all the people in tumultuous tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see him drag the unmeasured wight along.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How can it be,” (each to his fellow cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That one so weak could master one so strong?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce can Astolpho put the press aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So close from every part their numbers throng;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While all admire him as a cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of mighty worth, and make him goodly cheer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Cairo was not such, as common cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pronounces in our age that costly seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That eighteen thousand districts ill supply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lodging to those who in her markets meet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And though the houses are three stories high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Numbers are forced to sleep in the open street;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that the sultan has a palace there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wonderous size, and passing rich and fair;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And therein (Christian renegadoes all)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Keeps fifteen thousand vassals, for his needs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath one roof supplied with bower and stall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Themselves, and wives, and families, and steeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The duke desired to see the river’s fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how far Nile into the sea proceeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Damietta; where wayfaring wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He heard, was prisoner made or slain outright.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For at Nile’s outlet there, beside his bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sturdy thief was sheltered in a tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike the native’s and the stranger’s dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wont even to Cairo’s gate the road to scower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him no one could resist, and, it was said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That man to slay the felon had no power.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred thousand wounds he had in strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Received, yet none could ever take his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To see if he could break the thread which tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The felon’s life, upon his way the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Set forward, and to Damietta hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find Orrilo, so the thief was hight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to the river’s outlet past, and spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sturdy castle on the margin dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harboured in which the enchanted demon lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fruit of a hobgoblin and a fay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He here Orrilo and two knights in mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found at fierce strife: the two ill held their own</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against him; so Orrilo did assail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warlike pair, although himself alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how much either might in arms avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fame through the universal world had blown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Oliviero’s seed was either plant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon the white, and sable Aquilant.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The necromancer had this while (to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The truth,) with vantage on his side, begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fight, who brought a monster to the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found only in those parts, and wont to won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ashore or under water, and to prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For food, on human bodies; feeding on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poor mariners and travelling men, who fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the impending danger, unaware.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monster, slaughtered by the brethren two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the sand beside the haven lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence no wrong they to Orrilo do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assailing him together in this guise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him they dismembered often, and not slew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now he⁠—because dismembered⁠—ever dies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he replaces leg or hand like wax,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the good faulchion from his body hacks.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon and Aquilant by turns divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to the teeth, now breast, the enchanted wight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fruitless blow Orrilo does deride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the two baffled warriors rage for spite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him who falling silver has espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Which mercury by alchymists is hight),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatter, and reunite each broken member,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing my tale, what he has seen remember.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If the thief’s head be severed by the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He lights and staggers till he finds it; now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uptaken by the nose or by the hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fastened to the neck, I know not how.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This sometimes Gryphon takes, and, whirled through air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whelms in the stream; but bootless is the throw:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For like a fish can fierce Orrilo swim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And safely, with the head, regains the brim.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two ladies, meetly clad in fair array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One damsel was in black and one in white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who had been the occasion of that fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood by to gaze upon the cruel fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Either of these was a benignant fay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose care had nourished one and the other knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oliver’s children; when the babes forlorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They from the claws of two huge birds had torn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since, from Gismonda they had these conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne to a distance from their native sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But more to say were needless, since displayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the whole world has been their history.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though the author has the father’s name mis-said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One for another (how I know not, I)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mistaking. Now this fearful strife the pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of warriors waged at both the ladies’ prayer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though it was noon in the happy islands, day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had vanished in this clime, displaced by night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, underneath the moon’s uncertain ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ill-discerned, were all things hid from sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to the fort Orrilo took his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since both the sable sister and the white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were pleased the furious battle to defer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till a new sun should in the horizon stir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke, who by their ensigns, and yet more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had by the sight of many a vigorous blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon and Aquilant long time before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agnized, to greet the brethren was not slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they, who in the peer, victorious o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The giant, whom he led a captive, know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The <b>Baron of the Pard</b>, (so styled at court)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him to salute, with no less love resort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ladies to repose the warriors led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a fair palace near, their sumptuous seat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence issuing courtly squire and damsel sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them with lit torches in mid-way to meet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their goodly steeds they quit, there well bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put off their arms, and in a garden sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discern the ready supper duly laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast by, where a refreshing fountain played.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here they bid bind the giant on the green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast-tethered by a strong and weighty chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a tough oak, whose ancient trunk they ween</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May well be proof against a single strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that, by ten good serjeants overseen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest he by night get loose, and so the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assault and haply harm; while careless they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a guard and unsuspecting lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the abundant and most sumptuous board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With costly viands (its least pleasure) fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The longest topic for discourse afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orrilo’s prowess, and the marvel wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For head or arm dissevered by the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They (who upon the recent wonder thought)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might think a dream to see him reunite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And but return more furious to the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho in his book had found exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(That which prescribed a remedy for spell)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he who of one hair deprived the pest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Only could him in battle hope to quell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this plucked out or sheared, he from his breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Parforce the felon’s spirit would expell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So says the volume; but instructs not where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid locks so thickly set, to find the hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke no less with hope of conquest glows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if the palm he has already won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he that hopes with small expense of blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pluck the hair, the wizard-wight undone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence does he to the youthful pair propose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The burden of that enterprise upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself to take: Orrilo will he slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If the two brethren nought the intent gainsay,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But willingly to him these yield the emprize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assured his toil will be bestowed in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now a new Aurora climbs the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his walls Orrilo on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drops⁠—and the strife begins⁠—Orrilo plies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mace, the duke the sword; he ’mid a rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of strokes would from the body at one blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divorce the spirit of the enchanted foe:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Together with the mace he lops the fist;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now this arm, now the other falls to ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sometimes he cleaves the corslet’s iron twist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And piecemeal shares and maims the felon round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orrilo reunites the portions missed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found on the champagne, and again is sound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though into a hundred fragments hewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho sees him, in a thought, renewed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After a thousand blows, Astolpho sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One stroke, above the shoulders and below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The chin, which lopt away both helm and head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lights the duke less swiftly than his foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then grasps the hair defiled with gore and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Springs in a moment on his horse, and lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up-stream with it along Nile’s margin hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the thief cannot retake the prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That fool, who had not marked the warrior’s feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was searching in the dust to find his head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when he heard the charger in retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who through the forest with the plunder fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leapt quickly into his own courser’s seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in pursuit of bold Astolpho sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fain had Orrilo shouted “Hola! stay!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the duke had borne his mouth away:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet pleased Astolpho had not in like guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne off his heels, pursues with flowing rein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him Rabican, who marvellously flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Distances by a mighty length of plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while the wizard’s head Astolpho eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From poll to front, above the eyebrows twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searching, in haste, if he the hair can see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which makes Orrilo’s immortality.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid innumerable locks, no hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Straiter or crisper than the rest was seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How then should good Astolpho, in his care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay the thief, so many choose between?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To cut them all (he said) it better were.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And since he scissors lacked and razor keen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wanting these, resorted to his glaive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which cut so well, it might be said to shave;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, holding, by the nose, the severed head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Close-sheared it all, behind and eke before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He found, among the rest, the fatal thread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then pale became the visage, changing sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned up its eyes, and signals sore and dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the last agony of nature wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the headless body seated in the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shuddered its last, and from the courser fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke returns where he the champions two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dames had left, the trophy in his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which manifests of death the tokens true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shows the distant body on the sand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not if they this with pleasure view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though him they welcome with demeanour bland:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the intercepted victory might pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perchance inflict upon the envying twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor do I think that either gentle fay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pleasure could that battle’s issue see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since those kind dames, because they would delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The doleful fate which shortly was to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In France the brethren’s lot, had in that fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fierce Orrilo matched the warriors free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so to occupy the pair had cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the sad influence of the skies were past.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When to the castellan was certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Damietta, that the thief was dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loosed a carrier-pigeon, having tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath her wing a letter by a thread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She went to Cairo; and, to scatter wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The news, another from that town was sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such is the usage there); so, Egypt through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a few hours the joyful tidings flew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As he had brought the adventure to an end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The duke now sought the noble youths to stir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Though of themselves that way their wishes tend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor they to whet that purpose need the spur)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they the Church from outrage to defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rights of Charles, the Roman Emperor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would cease to war upon that Eastern strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would seek honour in their native land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon and Aquilant thus bid adieu,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and the other, to his lady fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, though it sorely troubled them, ill knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How to resist the wishes of the pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The duke, together with the warlike two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turns to the right, resolved to worship, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God erst incarnate dwelt, the holy places,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he to cherished France his way retraces.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warriors to the left-hand might incline,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As plainer and more full of pleasant cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where still along the sea extends their line;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But take the right-hand path, abrupt and drear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since the chief city of all Palestine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By six days’ journey, is, through this, more near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Water there is along this rugged track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grass; all other needful matters lack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So that, before they enter on their road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All that is needful they collect, and lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the giant’s back the bulky load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who could a tower upon his neck convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Holy Land a mountain-summit showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At finishing their rough and salvage way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where <b>Heavenly Love</b> a willing offering stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And washed away our errors with his blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They, at the entrance of the city, view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A gentle stripling; and in him the three</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agnize Sir Sansonet of Mecca, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was, in youth’s flower, for sovereign chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sovereign goodness, famed the country through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wise beyond his years: from paganry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Converted by Orlando to the truth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had, with his own hands, baptised the youth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Designing there a fortilage, in front</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Egypt’s caliph they the warrior found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with a wall two miles in length, the mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Calvary intending to surround.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Received with such a countenance, as is wont</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be of inward love the surest ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them he conducted to his royal home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with all comfort, harboured in the dome.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As deputy, the sainted land he swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conferred on him by Charlemagne, in trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the English duke a present made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that so sturdy and unmeasured beast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it ten draught-horse burdens had conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So monstrous was the giant and robust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho gave the giant, and next gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The net, in which he took the unwieldy slave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In quittance, Sansonet, his sword to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave a rich girdle to Astolpho bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spurs for either heel, a costly pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With bucklers and with rowels made of gold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which (’twas believed) the warrior’s relicts were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who freed the damsel from that dragon old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spoils, which Sir Sansonet, with many more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Joppa, when he took the city, bore</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cleansed of their errors in a monastery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence the odour of good works upwent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They of Christ’s passion every mystery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Contemplating, through all the churches went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which now, to our eternal infamy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foul Moor usurp; what time on strife intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All Europe rings with arms and martial deeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And war is everywhere but where it needs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While grace the warlike three devoutly sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent on pardon and on pious lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Grecian pilgrim, known to Gryphon, brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tidings, which ill the afflicted champion bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his long-cherished vow and former thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too foreign, too remote; and these so sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed his troubled breast, and bred such care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They wholly turned aside his mind from prayer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For his misfortune, one of lovely feature</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon worshipped, Origilla hight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fairer visage and of better stature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not one among a thousand meets the sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But faithless, and of such an evil nature,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou mightst town and city search outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And continent and island, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, never, as I think, wouldst find her peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In Constantine’s imperial city, burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a fierce fever, he had left the fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hoped to find her, to that place returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovelier than ever; and enjoy her there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she to Antioch (as the warrior learned)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had with another leman made repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking, while such fresh youth was yet her own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere not a thing to brook⁠—to sleep alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Gryphon, from the time he heard the news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had evermore bemoaned him, day or night:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever pleasure other wight pursues</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seems but the more to vex his troubled sprite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let each reflect, who to his mischief woos,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How keenly tempered are Love’s darts of might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, heavier than all ills, the torment fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he was ashamed his grief to tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This; for that Aquilant had oft before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reproved him for the passion which he nursed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sought to banish her from his heart’s core;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Her, who of all bad women is the worst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He still had censured, in his wiser lore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If by his brother Aquilant accurst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her Gryphon, in his partial love, excuses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For mostly self-conceit our sense abuses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It therefore is his purpose, without say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Aquilant, alone to take the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As far as Antioch, and bear her away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had borne off his heart-core from his breast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find him, who had made the dame his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And take such vengeance of him, ere he rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As shall for aye be told. My next will tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he effected this, and what befell.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Gryphon finds traitorous Origilla nigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Damascus city, with Martano vile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Slaughtered the Saracens and Christians lie</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By thousands and by thousands heaped this while;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if the Moor outside of Paris die,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the Sarzan so destroys each pile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such slaughter deals, that greater ill than this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never before has been exprest, I wiss.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Love’s penalties are manifold and dread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of which I have endured the greater part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to my cost, in these so well am read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I can speak of them as ’twere my art.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence if I say, or if I ever said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Did speech or living page my thoughts impart)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“One ill is grievous and another light.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yield me belief, and deem my judgment right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say, I said, and, while I live, will say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He, who is fettered by a worthy chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though his desire his lady should gainsay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, every way averse, his suit disdain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though Love deprive him of all praised pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After long time and trouble spent in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, if his heart be placed well-worthily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Needs not lament though he should waste and die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let him lament, who plays a slavish part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom two bright eyes and lovely tresses please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath which beauties lurks a wanton heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With little that is pure, and much of lees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wretch would fly; but bears in him a dart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like wounded stag, whichever way he flees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dares not confess, yet cannot quench, his flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of himself and worthless love has shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The youthful Gryphon finds him in this case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sees the error which he cannot right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees how vilely he his heart does place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On faithless Origille, his vain delight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet evil use doth sovereign reason chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And free-will is subdued by appetite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though a foul mind the lady’s actions speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, wheresoe’er she is, must Gryphon seek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Resuming the fair history, I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of the city he in secret rode;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to his brother would his plan bewray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who oft on him had vain reproof bestowed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to the left t’wards Ramah shaped his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the most level and most easy road.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him six days’ journey to Damascus brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence, setting out anew, he Antioch sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He nigh Damascus met the lover, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perfidious Origilla’s heart possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And matched in evil customs were the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like stalk and flower: for that in either’s breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was lodged a fickle heart; the dame untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he a traitor whom she loved the best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While both the lovers hid their nature base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To others’ cost, beneath a courteous face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As I relate to you, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came on huge courser, trapped with mickle pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With faithless Origille, in gorgeous gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gold embroidered, and with azure dyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two ready knaves, who serve the warrior, rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knightly helm and buckler at his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one who with fair pomp and semblance went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Damascus, to a tournament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Damascus’ king a splendid festival</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had in these days bid solemnly proclaim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with what pomp they could, upon his call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, in shining arms, the champions came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Gryphon’s sight the harlot’s spirits fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fears that he will work her scathe and shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knows her lover has not force and breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save her from Sir Gryphon, threatening death:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But like most cunning and audacious quean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although she quakes from head to foot with fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her voice so strengthens, and so shapes her mien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in her face no signs of dread appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having already made her leman ween</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The trick devised, she feigns a joyous cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Sir Gryphon goes, and for long space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hangs on his neck, fast-locked in her embrace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, after suiting with much suavity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The action to the word, sore weeping, cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Dear lord, is this the guerdon due to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For love and worship? that I should abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone one livelong year, deprived of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A second near⁠—and, yet upon thy side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No grief?⁠—and had I borne for thee to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not if I should have seen that day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When I from Nicosià thee expected</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(When thou wast journeying to the plenar court)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-209" id="noteref-209" epub:type="noteref">209</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cheer me⁠—left with fever sore infected,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the dread of death⁠—I heard report</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou wast gone to Syria; and dejected</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that ill tiding, suffered in such sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, all unable to pursue thy quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had nigh with this right-hand transfixt my breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But Fortune, by her double bounty, shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She guards me more than thou: me to convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She sent my brother here, who with me goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My honour safe in his protecting stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this encounter with thee now bestows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which I above all other blessings weigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in good time; for hadst thou longer stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My lord, I should have died of hope delayed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wicked woman, full of subtlety</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Worse than a fox in crafty hardihood)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursues, and so well shapes her history,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wholly throws the blame on Gryphon good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes him believe that other not to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her kin alone, but of her flesh and blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Got by one father;⁠—and so puts upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight, that he less credits Luke and John.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor he the fraud of her, more false than fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Only forbore with just reproach to pay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only did the threatened stranger spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was the lover of that lady gay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But deemed to excuse himself sufficient were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turning some portion of the blame away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as the real brother she profest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unceasingly the lady’s knight carest;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to Damascus, with the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned, who to Sir Gryphon made report,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That Syria’s wealthy king, with sumptuous cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within that place would hold a splendid court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who, baptised or infidel, appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There at his tourney (of whatever sort),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the city and without, assures</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From wrong, for all the time the feast endures.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet I of Origilla’s treachery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall not so steadfastly pursue the lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, famed not for one single perfidy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thousands and thousands had betrayed before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that I will return again to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two hundred thousand wretched men or more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Burnt by the raging wildfire, where they spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the walls of Paris, scathe and dread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I left you where king Agramant prepared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To storm a gate, and to the assault was gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This he had hoped to find without a guard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And work elsewhere to bar the way was none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For there, in person, Charles kept watch and ward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many, practised warriors every one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two Angelines, two Guidos, Angelier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avino, Avolio, Otho, and Berlinghier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One and the other host its worth, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles and king Agramant, desire to show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where praise, where riches are, they think, in store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For those that do their duty on the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such were not the atchievements of the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to repair the loss; for, to his woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full many a Saracen the champaign prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose folly was a beacon to the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The frequent darts a storm of hail appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from the city-wall the Christians fling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The deafening clamours put the heavens in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, from our part, and from that other, ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Charles and Agramant must wait; for here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of the Mars of Africa will sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont, that fierce and fearful man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That through the middle of the city ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I know not, sir, if you the adventure dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that so daring Moor to mind recall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The leader, who had left his people dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between the second work and outer wall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon those limbs the ravening fire so fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never sight more sad!⁠—I told withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How vaulting o’er that hindrance at a bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cleared the moat which girt the city round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he was known the thickening crowd among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the strange arms he wore and scaly hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There, where the aged sires and feebler throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Listened to each new tale on every side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven-high groan, moan, and lamentation rung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loud they beat their lifted palms and cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While those who had the strength to fly aloof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought safety not from house or temple’s roof.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But this the cruel sword concedes to few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So brandished by that Saracen robust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here, with half a leg dissevered, flew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A foot, there head divided from the bust:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This cleft across, and that behold him hew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From head to hips, so strong the blow and just.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While, of the thousands wounded by the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is none that shows an honest scar before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What by weak herd, in fields of Hircany,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tiger does, or Indian Ganges near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or wolf, by lamb or kid, on heights which lie</span>

				<span class="i1">On Typheus’ back, the cruel cavalier<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-210" id="noteref-210" epub:type="noteref">210</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now executes on those, I will not, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Call phalanxes or squadrons, but a mere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rabble, that I should term a race forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who but deserved to die ere they were born.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of all he cuts, and thrusts, and maims, and bleeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is not one who looks him in the face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout that street, which in a straight line leads</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up to <abbr>St.</abbr> Michael’s bridge, so thronged a space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont, terrible and fearful, speeds,</span>

				<span class="i1">Whirling his bloody brand, nor grants he grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his career, to servant or to lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saint and sinner feel alike the sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Religion cannot for the priest bespeak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mercy, nor innocence avail the child:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor gently beaming eyes, nor vermeil cheek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Protect the blooming dame or damsel mild.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Age smites its breast and flies: while bent to wreak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vengeance, the Saracen, with gore defiled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shows not his valour more than cruel rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heedless alike of order, sex, and age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor the impious king alone with human blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Lord of the impious he⁠—his hand distains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But even on walls so sorely vents his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fires fair houses, and polluted fanes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The houses almost all were made of wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then (as ’tis told) and this, by what remains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May be believed; for yet in Paris we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six out of ten no better builded see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though flames demolish all things far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This ill appears his furious hate to slake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er the paynim has his hands applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He tumbles down a roof at every shake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My lord, believe, you never yet espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bombard in Padua, of so large a make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it could rend from wall of battered town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What, at a single pull, the king plucked down.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While the accursed man, amid the rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So warred with fire and sword, if at his post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant had prest it from without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ample city had that day been lost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he was hindered by the warrior stout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who came from England with the advancing host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Composed of English and of Scotch allied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Silence and the Angel for their guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was God’s will, that while through town and tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The furious Rodomont such ruin spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither arrived Rinaldo, Clermont’s flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three leagues above, he o’er the river’s bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had cast a bridge; from whence his English power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the left-hand by crooked ways he led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, meaning to assail the barbarous foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stream no obstacle might interpose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo had, with Edward, sent a force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six thousand strong, of archer-infantry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sped, with Ariman, two thousand horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of lightest sort; and foot and cavalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought Paris by those roads, which have their course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Directly to, and from, the Picard sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That by <abbr>St.</abbr> Martin’s and <abbr>St.</abbr> Denys’ gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They might convey the aid the burghers wait.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo sent with these the baggage train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And carriages, with which his troops were stored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fetching, with the forces that remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A compass, he the upper way explored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bridge, and boat, and means to pass the Seine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had with him; for it here was ill to ford.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He past his army, broke the bridges down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rank’d in line the bands of either crown.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-211" id="noteref-211" epub:type="noteref">211</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But having first the peers and captains wheeled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About him in a ring, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mounted the bank which overtopt the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much, that all might plainly see and hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cried, “My lords, you should thanksgiving yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lifted hands, to God, who brought you here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through whom, o’er every nation, you may gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eternal glory, bought with little pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Two princes, by your means, will rescued be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you relieve those city gates from siege;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, your own king, whom you from slavery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And death to save, a subject’s vows oblige;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a famed emperor, of more majesty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than ever yet in court was served by liege,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with them other kings, and dukes, and peers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lords of other lands, and cavaliers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So that one city saving, not alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will the Parisians bless your helping hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, sadder than for sorrows of their own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Timid, afflicted, and disheartened stand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And their unhappy wives and children moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which share in the same peril, and the band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or virgins, dedicate to heavenly spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest this day frustrate see their holy vows;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“I say, this city saved from deadly wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only will Parisians hold you dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But habitants of all the countries round:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor speak I only of the nations near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For city there is none on Christian ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what has citizens beleaguered here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that to you, for vanquishing the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More lands than France will obligation owe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If him the ancients with a crown endued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who saved one citizen by worthy deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For rescuing such a countless multitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What recompense shall be your worthy meed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if, from jealousy or sloth, so good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And holy, enterprise should ill succeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believe me, only while these walls endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is Italy or Almàyn’s realm secure;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or any other part, where men adore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, who for us upon the cross was hung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor think that distance saves you from the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deem your island strong, the waves among.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if, from far Gibraltar’s straits of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And old Alcides’ pillars, sailed the throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bear off plunder from your sea-girt strands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What will they do when they possess our lands?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-212" id="noteref-212" epub:type="noteref">212</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, if in this fair enterprise arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No gain, no glory served you as a guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A common debt enjoins you mutual aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Militant here upon one Church’s side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moreover, let not any be afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our broken foemen will the assault abide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seem to me ill-taught in warlike art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A feeble rabble without arms or heart.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such reasons, and yet better for, that need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might good Rinaldo in his speech infer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with quick phrase and voice, to valiant deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The high-minded barons and bold army stir;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this was but to goad a willing steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As the old proverb says) who lacks no spur.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He moved the squadrons, having closed his speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Softly, beneath their separate banners, each.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, without clamour, without any noise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So moves his triple host, their flags below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, marching by the stream, enjoys</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The honour first to assail the barbarous foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin the Irishmen employs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More inland, with a wider wheel to go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus England’s horse and foot, the two between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Led by the Duke of Lancaster, are seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The paladin rode on, along the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he had put the warriors in their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, passing by their squadrons, pricked before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Valiant Zerbino and his whole array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he reached the quarters of the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Oran’s king, and king Sobrino lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, half-a-mile removed from those of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Posted upon that side, observed the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With such a faithful escort fortified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sure, the Christians who had thither wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Silence and the Angel for their guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer could stand mute or keep their ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But hearing now the foe, with shouts defied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their host, and made the shrilling trumpets sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with loud clamours, which Heaven’s concave fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent through the paynim’s bones a deadly chill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo spurs before the troops combined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foaming courser, and his weapon rests;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a full bowshot leaves the Scots behind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So all delay the impatient peer molests.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As oftentimes an eddying gust of winds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issues, ere yet the horrid storm infests,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sallying swiftly from the following herd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo forth upon Bayardo spurred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the aspect of the paladin of France,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wavering Moorish files betray their fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, trembling in their hands, is seen the lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their thighs and stirrups quivering, like the spear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Pulian only marks the knight’s advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowing Rinaldo not, unchanged in cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thinking such a cruel shock to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gallops against him on his courser fleet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He stoops upon the weapon which he strains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whole and collected for the martial game:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to his horse abandoning the reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goading with both spurs the courser, came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the other side no valour feigns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But shows, by doings, what he is in name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—With what rare grace and matchless art he wars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The son of Aymon, rather son of Mars.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well-matched in skill, they aimed their cruel blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lances at each other’s heads addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill matched, in arms and valour, were the foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For <em>this</em> past on, and <em>that</em> the champaigne prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More certain proof of worth, when warriors close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There needs than knightly lance, well placed in rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Fortune even more than Valour needs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ill, without her saving succour, speeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the good spear new levelled in his fist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Oran’s king behold Rinaldo dart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of bulk, and bone, and sinew, to resist</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch was, but ill supplied with heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his might pass for a fair stroke in list,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though planted in the buckler’s nether part.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let those excuse it who refuse to admire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since the good paladin could reach no higher.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor did the buckler so the weapon stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though made of palm within, and steel without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that it pierced the paunch, and made a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To let that mean and ill matched spirit out.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser, who had deemed that all the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He must so huge a burden bear about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thanked in his heart the warrior, who well met,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had thus preserved him from so sore a sweat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo, having broke his rested spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wheels his horse, he seems equipt with wings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, turning swiftly with the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the closest crowd, impetuous springs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Composed of brittle glass the arms appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Sir Rinaldo red Fusberta swings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor tempered steel is there, nor corslet thick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which keeps the sword from biting to the quick.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet few the tempered plates or iron pins</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which encounters that descending brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But targets, some of oak and some of skins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quilted vest and turban’s twisted band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lightly such drapery good Rinaldo thins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleaves, and bores, and shears, on either hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor better from his sword escapes the swarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than grass from sweeping scythe, or grain from storm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The foremost squadron had been put to flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thither the vanguard Zerbino led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth pricking from the following crowd, in sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared, with levelled lance, their youthful head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With no less fury those who trooped to fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath his banner, to the combat sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like lions, like so many wolves, who leap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fury to the assault of goat or sheep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Both spurred their coursers on, with rested lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When either warrior to his foe was near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that short interval, that small expanse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of plain, between, was seen to disappear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never witnessed yet a stranger dance!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the Scots only ply the murderous spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Only the scattered paynims slaughtered lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if conducted thither but to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It seemed as if each coward Paynim grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More cold than ice; each Scot more fierce than flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moors believed that with Rinaldo’s thew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And muscle fortified, each Christian came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino quickly moved his ordered crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor stayed till herald should his call proclaim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better were they than those which went before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For captain, armour, and for martial lore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Less worthless men of Africa were they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though ill had they been deemed of much avail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill harnessed, and worse trained to martial fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith King Dardinel, the foe to assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved up his host, himself in helmet gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sheathing all his limbs in plate and mail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fourth division I believe was best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, under Isolier, to battle prest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thraso, this while, the valiant Duke of Mar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glad in the tumult, for the cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who muster in his train, uplifts the bar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the lists of fame his following cheers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Isolier, with horsemen of Navarre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entered in that fierce fray he sees and hears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next Ariodantes moved his chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was of late made Duke of Albany.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The deep sonorous trumpet’s bellowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sound of drum, and barbarous instrument,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Combined with twang of bow, and whiz of sling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheel and machine, and stone from engine sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (what more loud than these appeared to ring)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tumult, and shriek, and groan, and loud lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Composed a direr whole than what offends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The neighbouring tribes where deafening Nile descends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The arrows’ double shower the ample sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wide-extended shade is seen to shrowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breath, smoke of sweat and dust ascend on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seem to stamp in air a murky cloud.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By turns each host gives way, and you might spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now chasing, now in flight, the selfsame crowd;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here some wight, beside his foeman slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or little distant, prostrate on the plain.</span>

				<span>When, harassed with fatigue, a wearied crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Withdraw, fresh files their fellows reinforce:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men, here and there, the wasted ranks renew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here march supplies of foot, and there of horse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her mantle green for robe of crimson hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth shifts, ensanguined where the warriors course:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there were azure flowers and yellow sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now slaughtered men lie stretched their steeds among.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino was more wonders seen to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than ever stripling of his age; he strowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ground with heaps of dead, and overthrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim numbers which about him flowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant Ariodantes to his new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entrusted squadron mighty prowess showed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filling with dread and wonder, near and far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The squadrons of Castile and of Navarre.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Chelindo and Mosco (bastards were the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Calabrun, late king of Arragon),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one esteemed among the valiant train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calamidor, of Barcellona’s town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving their standards, in the hope to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By young Zerbino’s death, a glorious crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Attacked the warrior with united force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wounded in his flanks the prince’s horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pierced by three lances lay the courser strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bold Zerbino quickly rose anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, eager to avenge his charger’s wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The assailants, where he sees them, will pursue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino at Mosco first, that overhung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, in the hope to make him prisoner, flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pierced him in the flank; who from his sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pallid and cold, upon the champaign fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When him so killed, as ’twere by stealthy blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chelindo viewed, to avenge his brother slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He charged, intent the prince to overthrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But <em>he</em> seized fast his courser by the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, thence to rise not, laid the charger low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destined no more to feed on hay or grain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For at one stroke, so matchless was his force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino cleft the rider and his horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that fell blow Calamidor espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turned the bridle short to speed away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him with downright cut Zerbino plied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind, and cried withal, “Stay, traitor, stay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from its aim the sword-stroke wandered wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though from the mark it went somedeal astray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The falchion missed the rider as he fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But reached the horse’s croup, and stretched him dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He quits the horse, and thence for safety crawls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he with little boot escapes his foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him Duke Thraso’s horse o’erturns and mawls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opprest the ponderous courser’s weight below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the huge crowd upon Zerbino falls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes and Lurcanio go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with them many a cavalier and count,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who do their best Zerbino to remount.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Artalìco and Margano knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The force of Ariodantes’ circling brand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Casimir and Enearco rue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More deeply yet the puissance of his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote by the knight, escaped the former two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The others were left dead upon the strand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio shows what are his force and breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who charges, smites, o’erturns, and puts to death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir, think not that more inland on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warfare is less mortal than along</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stream, nor that the troops behind remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the duke of Lancaster belong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He valiantly assailed the flags of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And long in even scale the battle hung.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Horse and Foot, and Captains of those bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On either side, could deftly ply their hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forward Sir Oldrad pricks and Fieramont;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This Glocester’s duke, and York’s the other knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With them conjoined is Richard, Warwick’s count,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the bold duke of Clarence, Henry hight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These Follicon and Matalista front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Baricond, with all they lead to fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almeria <em>this</em>, and <em>that</em> Granada guides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And o’er Marjorca Baricond presides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well matched awhile the Christian and the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared, without advantage in the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not <em>this</em>, now <em>that</em> gave ground, like corn before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The light and fickle breeze which blows in May:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or as the sea which ripples on the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still comes and goes, nor keeps one certain way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When hollow Fortune thus had sported long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She proved disastrous to the paynim throng.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke of Glocester Matalista bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assailed this while, and hurtled from his sell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fieramont Follicon o’erturned and rolled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the right shoulder smit, on earth as well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The advancing English either Paynim hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bear their prisoners off to dungeon-cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while, Sir Baricond is, in the strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Clarence’s bold duke deprived of life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hence ’tis among the Moors amazement all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While hence the Christians take such heart and pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bands do nought but quit their ground and fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And break their order on the Paynim side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the Christian troops come on, and gall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their flying rants, which nowhere will abide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had not one arrived to aid their host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Paynim camp had on that side been lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Ferraù, who till this time ever nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marsilius, scarce had quitted him that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When half destroyed he marked his chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw that baffled banner born away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pricked his good courser forth, in time to spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Where mid those squadrons hottest waxed the fray)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his head severed in a griesly wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olympio de la Serra fall to ground:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A stripling he, who such sweet musick vented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accorded to the horned lyre’s soft tone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That at the dulcet melody relented</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hearer’s heart, though harder than a stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Happy! if, with such excellence contented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had pursued so fair a fame alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loathed shield, quiver, helmet, sword and lance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destined by these to die a youth in France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When bold French beheld <em>his</em> cruel plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For whom he love and much esteem profest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He felt more pity at the doleful sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than, ’mid those thousands slain, for all the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smote the foe who slew him with such might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he his helm divided from the crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cut front, eyes, visage, and mid bosom through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cast him down amid the slaughtered crew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor stops he here, nor leaves a corslet whole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor helm unbroken, where his sword is plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of <em>this</em> the front or cheek, of <em>that</em> the poll,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The arm of other foe his strokes divide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, of <em>these</em> divorcing body and soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Restores the wavering battle on that side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence the disheartened and ignoble throng</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are scattered wide, and broke, and driven along.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Into the medley pricks King Agramant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desirous there his bloody course to run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him King Baliverzo, Farurant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Soridan, Bambirago, Prusion;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next so many more of little vaunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose blood will form a lake ere day be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I could count each leaf with greater ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When autumn of their mantle strips the trees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant from the wall a numerous band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of horse and foot withdraws, and sends the array</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the king of Fez, with a command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind the Moorish tents to make his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those of Ireland in their march withstand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he sees hurrying with what haste they may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with wide wheel and spacious compass wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fall upon the Paynim camp behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king of Fez upon this service prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all delay might sore his work impede.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while King Agramant unites the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And parts the troops who to the battle speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sought himself the river, where he guessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish host might most his presence need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, from that quarter, had a courier prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By King Sobrino sent, the monarch’s aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He more than half his camp behind him led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In one deep phalanx. At the mighty sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone, the Scotsmen trembled, and in dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoned honour, order, and their ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio, Ariodantes, and their head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, there alone the torrent bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply he, who was afoot, had died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that in time his need Rinaldo spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Elsewhere the paladin was making fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred banners: while the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So chased the quailing Saracens, the cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of young Zerbino’s peril smote the ear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, single and afoot, his chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the Africans had left the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo turned about and took his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he beheld the Scots in disarray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He plants his courser, where their squadrons yield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the fierce paynims, and exclaims: “Where go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your bands, and why so basely quit the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yielding so vilely to so vile a foe?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold the promised trophies, spear and shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spoils which your loaded churches ought to show!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What praise! what glory! that alone, and reft</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his good horse, your monarch’s son is left!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He from a squire receives a lance, and spies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Prusion little distant, sovereign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the Alvaracchiae, and against him hies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he unhorses, dead upon the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Agricalt, so Bambirago dies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next sore wounded is Sir Soridane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had been slain as well amid the throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If good Rinaldo’s lance had proved more strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That weapon broken, he Fusberta rears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smites Sir Serpentine, him of the star.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though charmed from mischief are the cavalier’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good arms, he falls astounded by the jar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus Rinaldo round Zerbino clears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field so widely, where those champions war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That without more dispute he takes a horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those, who masterless, at random, course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That he in time remounted it was well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who haply would not, if he more delayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Agramant at once, and Dardinel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino, and Balastro thither made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, who had in time regained the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheeled, here and there his horse, with brandished blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispatching into hell the mixt array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That how men live above their ghosts might say.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The good Rinaldo, who to overthrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The strongest of the foeman covets still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Agramant directs a deadly blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Who seems too passing-proud, and greater ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Works there, than thousand others of the foe⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spurs his horse, the Moorish chief to spill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He smote the monarch, broadside charged the steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And man and horse reversed upon the mead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What time, without, in such destructive frays</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hate, Rage, and Fury, all offend by turns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Paris Rodomont the people slays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And costly house, and holy temple burns:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Charles elsewhere anther duty stays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who nothing hears of this, nor aught discerns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, in the town, receives the British band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Edward and Sir Ariman command.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him a squire approached, who pale with dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce drew his breath, and cried; “Oh, well away!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! alas!” (and thus he often said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he could utter aught beside) “To-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To-day, sire, is the Roman empire sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Christ to the heathen makes his flock a prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fiend from air to-day has dropt, that none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Henceforth may in this city make their won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Satan (in sooth, it can no other be)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destroys and ruins the unhappy town.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turn, and the curling wreaths of vapour see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the red flames which wander up and down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">List to those groans, and be they warrantry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the sad news thy servant now makes known!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>One</em> the fair city wastes with sword and fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before whose vengeful fury all retire.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even such as he, who hears the tumult wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clatter of church-bells, ere he espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The raging fire, concealed from none beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself, to him most dangerous, and most nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such was King Charles; who heard, and then descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The new disaster with his very eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence he the choicest of his meiny steers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where he the cry and tumult hears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With many peers and chiefs, who worthiest are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Summoned about him, Charlemagne is gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bids direct his standards to the square</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither the paynim had repaired; hears groan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tumult, spies the horrid tokens there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of cruelty, sees human members strown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—No more⁠—Let him return another time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who willingly will listen to this rhyme.</span>

				<span>The Christian people then God’s placid front</span>

				<span class="i1">Proves worse than all the ills endured before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I said that Charlemagne had made repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In search of him towards the city square.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charles, by the way, his people’s butchery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds⁠—burnt palaces and ruined fanes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sees large portion of the city lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In unexampled wreck.⁠—“Ye coward trains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither in heartless panic would ye fly?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will none his loss contemplate? what remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you⁠—what place of refuge, say, is left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this from you so shamefully be reft?</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Then shall one man alone, a prisoned foe,</span>

				<span class="i1">And shame, too strong to brook, in fury said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the spacious square made good his way,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Thither large portion of the populace,</span>

				<span class="i1">With ammunition, for their long support.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont, mad with pride, had, in his chase</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the scared burghers, singly cleared the court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with one daring hand, which scorned the world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandished the sword;⁠—his other wildfire hurled;</span>

				<span>Rodomont stands before the portal, bright</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor what upon the paynim smote beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sufficed to arrest the sanguinary foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who broke and hewed, and shook that portal wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in his fury let such daylight through,</span>

				<span class="i1">’Twas easy to espy⁠—and might be spied⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In visages o’ercast in deathlike sort,</span>

				<span>Through those fair chambers echoed shouts of dread,</span>

				<span class="i1">And grieving, through the house, pale women fled,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too soon to be by stranger lords possest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The matter in this state of peril hung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thither came the king, his peers among.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charles turned him round to these, of vigorous hand,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Are you not those that erst with me did stand</span>

				<span class="i1">With hundreds more, that you now fear to face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One of that very blood, that very race?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why should I now in contest with the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less strength in you behold than them? Your might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon this hound (pursued the monarch) show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This hound who preys on man.⁠—A generous sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thought of death⁠—approach he fast or slow⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he dies but well, holds cheap and light.</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This said, he spurred his courser, couched his spear,</span>

				<span class="i1">Sir Ogier joined the king in his career;</span>

				<span class="i1">Damascus’ gate, and him who with her came,</span>

				<span class="i1">The adulterer, not the brother of the dame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of all the cities under eastern skies,</span>

				<span class="i1">Most wealthy, populous, and fairly dight,</span>

				<span class="i1">A fertile plain, abundant fruits supplies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Winter and summer, sojourn of delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shading the city from the dawning day,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Two crystal streams the wealthy city scower;</span>

				<span class="i1">Scent, issuing from each home, a cloud of sweets.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then the high-street gay signs of triumph wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covered with showy cloths of different dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which deck the walls, while sylvan leaves in store,</span>
				<br/>

				<span>Within the city gates in frolic sport,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fairer show remains; the sumptuous court</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of barons bold and vassals, who advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Garnished with what could be procured, of ore</span>

				<span class="i1">And pearl, from Ind and Erythraean shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forward Sir Gryphon pricked, with his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surveying, here and there, the whole at ease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When them a knight arrested by the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (such his wont and natural courtesies)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obliged beneath his palace-roof to stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he let nought be wanting which might please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cheerfully the guests, with bath restored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next welcomed at his costly supper-board;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And told “how he, who, Norandino hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Damascus and all Syria’s kingdom swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Native and foreigner had bade invite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom the sword of knighthood had been laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a fair joust, which at the morrow’s light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ensuing, in the square was to be made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where they might show, and without further faring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If they had valour equal to their bearing.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon, though he came not that joust to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accepts the challenge of the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For when occasion serves, it cannot be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An evil use to make our worth appear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then questioned more of that solemnity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“If ’twere a wonted feast, held every year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or new emprise; by which, in martial course,</span>

				<span class="i1">The monarch would assay his warriors’ force.”⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The gorgeous feast our monarch will display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each fourth succeeding moon,” the baron said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“This is the first that you will now survey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None have been held beside. The cause which bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The solemn usage is, that on such day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king from sovereign peril saved his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After four months, consumed in doleful wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid tears and groans, with death before his eyes.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wait upon her home, a fair array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards his Syrian realm had shaped his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But as we scoured the fell Carpathian sea,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-219" id="noteref-219" epub:type="noteref">219</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With flowing sheet, at distance from the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A storm assailed us, of such cruelty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tempest even scared our pilot hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drifting three days and nights at random, we</span>

				<span class="i1">And kitchens there construct, and rustic stoves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And carpets for the intended banquet spread.</span>

				<span class="i1">Seeking red deer, goat, fallow-buck, and doe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, following him, two servants bear his bow.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“While, with much solace, seated in a round,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approaching us along the shore, astound,</span>

				<span class="i1">Your eyesight with his semblance foul and stern!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better it is of him by fame to hear,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To calculate the griesly monster’s height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So measureless is he) exceeds all skill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fungus-hue, in place of orbs of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their sockets two small bones like berries fill.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-220" id="noteref-220" epub:type="noteref">220</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards us, as I say, he speeds outright</span>

				<span class="i1">In guise of brach, who enters on the trail.</span>

				<span class="i1">Better than aught possest of scent and sight:</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Some here, some there make off, but little gain</span>

				<span class="i1">By flying him; for swifter is the pest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the south wind. Of forty, ten, with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swimming aboard the bark in safety rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under his arm some wretches of our train</span>

				<span class="i1">He packed, nor empty left his lap or breast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loaded a capacious scrip beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, like a shepherd’s, to his waist was tied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Us to his den the sightless monster carried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hollowed within a rock, upon the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of snowy marble was that cavern quarried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As white as leaf, unstained by inky score.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him within the cave a matron tarried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who marked by grief and pain a visage wore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her were wife and maid, a numerous court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both fair and foul, of every age and sort.</span>

				<span>“Large as the other, and that grotto near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almost upon the summit of the rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another cavern was contrived, to rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the weather fend his woolly flock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he still herded through the changeful year;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So numerous, it were hard to count his stock:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wont in due season these to pen or loose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And play the shepherd more for sport than use.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The flesh of man he savoured more than sheep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this, before he reached the cave, was seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three youths of ours, ere yet he climbed the steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He are alive, or rather swallowed clean;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then moved the stone, which closed that cavern deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lodged us there. With that, to pasture green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His flock he led, as wont, the meads among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounding the pipe which at his neck was hung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Our lord, meanwhile, returning to the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loss which he had suffered comprehends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in deep silence, upon every hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through empty tent and hut the monarch wends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor who has robbed him can be understand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And full of terror to the beach descends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence he his sailors in the offing sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unmoor and spread their canvas to the breeze.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As soon as Norandino was in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They launched and sent their pinnace to convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch thence: but he no sooner knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the fell orc, and those he made his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then he, without more thought, would him pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And follow, wheresoe’er he bent his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lose Lucina is such cruel pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That life is loathsome save he her regain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When on the newly printed sand his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Norandine fixt, he with the swiftness sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which the rage of love a man supplies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he reached the cave of which I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where we, enduring greater agonies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than e’er were suffered, there await in dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The orc, and deem at every sound we hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The famished brute about to reappear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The monarch to the cave did Fortune guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the orc’s wife alone was in the lair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing the king; ‘Fly!⁠—Woe to thee!’ (she cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Should the orc take thee!’⁠—‘Woeful every where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I cannot choose but be,’ (the king replied)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Whether be take or miss me, kill or spare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not hither I by chance have wandered, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come with desire beside my wife to die.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He afterwards the dame for tidings pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those the orc had taken on the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of Lucina above all the rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If slain or prisoner kept. With kindly lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She Norandino, in return, addressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said ‘Lucina lived, nor need he more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have of her future safety any dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the orc on flesh of woman never fed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-221" id="noteref-221" epub:type="noteref">221</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Of this you may behold the proof in me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all these other dames who with me dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor me, nor them the orc offends, so we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Depart not ever from this caverned cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But vainly who would from her prison flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hopes peace or pardon from our tyrant fell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Buried alive, or bound with griding band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of, in the sun, stript naked on the sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘When hither he to-day conveyed your crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The females from the males he severed not;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as he took them, in confusion threw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All he had captive made, into that grot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will scent out their sex; not tremble, you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest he the women slay: the others’ lot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is fixt; and, of four men or six a-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be sure the greedy orc will make his prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I have no counsel for you how to free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady; but content thyself to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in no danger of her life will be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will our lot, in good or evil, share.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But go, for love of Heaven, my son, lest thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monster smell, and on thy body fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For when arrived, he sniffs about the house,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, such his subtle scent, can wind a mouse.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To her the amorous monarch made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘That he the cave would not abandon, ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw Lucina, and near her to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to live far from her, esteemed more dear.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Seeing that she can nothing more supply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fitted to shake the purpose of the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a new design the matron hits.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued with all her pains, with all her wits.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With slaughtered sheep and goat was evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavern filled, the numerous flock’s increase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which served her and her household as a store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the ceiling dangled many a fleece.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame made Norandino from a hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And huge he-goat’s fat bowels take the grease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the suet all his members pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he drove his natural scent away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And when she thought he had imbibed the smell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the rank goat exhales, she took the hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made him creep into the shaggy fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was well covered by that mantle wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him in this strange disguise she from the cell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crawling (for such was her command) did guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, prisoned by a stone, in her retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was hid his beauteous lady’s visage sweet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Kin Norandine, as bid, took up his ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the cavern, on the greensward laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might enter with the flock who wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Homeward; and longing sore, till evening stayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At eve he hears the hollow elder’s sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon whose pipes the wonted tune was played,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calling his sheep from pasture to their rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the fell swain who stalked behind his flock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Think if his heart is trembling at its core,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Norandino hears the approaching strains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now advancing to the cavern door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sight of that terrific face sustains!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if fear shook him, pity moved him more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You see if he loves well or only feigns!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The orc removed the stone, unbarred the cote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the king entered, amid sheep and goat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His flock so housed, to us the orc descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first had care the cavern door to close:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then scented all about, and having ended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His quest, two wretches for his supper chose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So is remembrance by this meal offended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It makes me tremble yet: this done, he goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And being gone, the king his goatish vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Casts off, and folds his lady to his breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whereas she him with pleasure should descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, seeing him, but suffers grief and pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She sees him thither but arrived to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cannot hinder her from being slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘ ’Twas no small joy ’mid all the woes, that.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him exclaimed Lucina, ‘here sustain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou wert not among us found to-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When hither I was brought, the monster’s prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘For though to find myself about to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This life be bitter and afflict me sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such is our common instinct, I should grieve</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for myself; but whether thee, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of after me, the orc of life bereave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assure thyself thy death will pain me more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than mine.’ And thus the dame persists to moan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More Norandino’s danger than her own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘A hope conducts me here,’ the monarch said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘To save thee and thy followers every one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if I cannot, I were better dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than living without light of thee, my sun!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I trust to scape, as hither I have spied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As ye shall all, if, as ourselves have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To compass our design, you do not shrink</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To imbue your bodies with the loathsome stink.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The trick he told, wherewith the monster’s smell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cheat, as first to him the wife had told:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In any case to cloathe us in the fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he may feel is issueing from the fold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many men as women in the cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We slay (persuaded by the monarch bold)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many goats as with our number square,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those which stink the most and oldest are.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We smeared our bodies with the fruitful grease</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which round about the fat intestines lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cloathed our bodies with the shaggy fleece:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while from golden dwelling broke the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, his flock returning to release,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We viewed the shepherd, with the dawning ray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, giving breath to the sonorous reeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Piped forth his prisoned flock to hill and meads.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He held his hand before the opened lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest with the herd we issued from the den,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stopt us short; but feeling wool or hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon our bodies, let us go again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By such a strange device we rescued were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cloathed in our shaggy fleeces, dames and men:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any issuing thence the monster kept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till thither, sore alarmed, Lucina crept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lucina⁠—whether she abhorred the scent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like us others, loathed herself to smear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Or whether with a slower gait she went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than might like the pretended beast’s appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Or whether, when the orc her body hent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her dread so mastered her, she screamed for fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Or that her hair escaped from neck or brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was known; nor can I well inform you how.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So were we all intent on our own case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We for another’s danger had no eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, turning at the scream. I saw uncase</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already her whom he had made his prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And force her to the cavern to retrace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her steps: we, couching in our quaint disguise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wend with the flock, where us the shepherd leads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through verdant mountains, into pleasant meads.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There we awaited, till beneath the shade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure, we saw the beaked orc asleep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When one along the shore of ocean made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one betook him to the mountain steep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Norandine his love alone delayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would return disguised among the sheep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from the place depart, while life remained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless his faithful consort he regained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For when before, on the flock issuing out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw her prisoned in the cave alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the orc’s wide throat he was about</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To spring; so grief had reason overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he advanced even to the monster’s snout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, but by little, scaped the grinding stone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet him the hope detained amid the flock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trusting to bear Lucina from the rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The orc, at eve, when to the cave again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He brings the herd, nor finds us in the stall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knows that he must supperless remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lucina guilty of the whole does call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned to stand, fast girded with a chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In open air, upon the summit tall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king who caused her woes, with pitying eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Looks on, and pines⁠—and only cannot die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Morning and evening, her, lamenting sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever the unhappy lover might survey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time he grieving went afield before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The issuing flock, or homeward took his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, with sad face, and suppliant evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Signed that for love of Heaven he would not stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since there he tarried at great risk of life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could in any thing assist his wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So the orc’s wife, as well upon her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Implored him to depart, but moved him nought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To go without Lucina he denied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And but remained more constant in his thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this sad servitude he long was tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Love and Pity bound: till Fortune brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pair of warriors to the rocky won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso, and Agrican’s redoubted son:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-222" id="noteref-222" epub:type="noteref">222</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Where, with their arms so wrought the champions brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They freed Lucina from the chains she wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Though he Wit less than Fortune served in save)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And running to the sea their burden bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to her father, who was there, they gave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was at morn, when in the cavern hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mixt with the goats, king Norandino stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ruminating, chewed their grassy food:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But when, at daylight, ’twas unbarred, and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was instructed that his wife was gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the orc’s consort told the tale, and how,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In every point, the thing rehearsed was done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thanked his God, and begged, with promised vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, since ’twas granted her such ill to shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would direct his wife to some repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence he might free her, by arms, gold, or prayer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Together with the flat-nosed herd his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took, and for green meads rejoicing made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He here expected, till the monster lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extended, underneath the gloomy shade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then journeyed all the night and all the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till, of the cruel orc no more afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He climbed a bark on Satalia’s strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, three days past, arrived on Syrian land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In Cyprus, and in Rhodes, by tower and town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in near Egypt, Turkey, or Afric lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king bade seek Lucina up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could hear news of her till the other day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other day, his father-in-law made known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had her safe with him. What caused her stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Nicosià was a cruel gale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had long time been adverse to her sail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The king, for pleasure of the tidings true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepares the costly feast in solemn state;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will on each fourth moon that shall ensue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make one, resembling this we celebrate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pleased of that time the memory to renew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, in the orc’s cavern, had to wait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—For four months and a day⁠—which is to-morrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he was rescued from such cruel sorrow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The things related I in part descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from him, present at the whole, heard more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Norandine, through calend and through ide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pent, till he changed to smiles his anguish sore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if from other you hear aught beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say, he is ill instructed in his lore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Syrian gentleman did thus display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The occasion of that feast and fair array.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Large portion of the night, in like discourse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by those cavaliers together spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who deemed that Love and Pity’s mickle force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was proved in that so dread experiment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then rising, when the supper’s sumptuous course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was cleared, to good and pleasant lodgings went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as the ensuing morning fairly broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sounds of triumph and rejoicing woke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The circling drums’ and trumpets’ echoing strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assemble all the town within the square;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, when mixt with sound of horse and wain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud outcries through the streets repeated are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon dons his glittering arms again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A panoply of those esteemed most rare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose mail, impassable by spear or brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, the white fay, had tempered with her hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The man of Antioch in his company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed him (a recreant worse than he was none),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Provided by their landlord’s courtesy</span>

				<span class="i1">Who with his kindred, a fair chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring the warriors to the square is gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With squires afoot and mounted upon steeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he bestowed, as aptest for their needs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They in the square arrived and stood aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor of themselves awhile would make display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better to see the martial gallants ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By twos and threes, or singly, to the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One told, by colours cunningly allied,</span>

				<span class="i1">His joy or sorrow to his lady gay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One, with a painted Love on crest or shield,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was the Syrians’ practise in that age</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To arm them in this fashion of the west.</span>

				<span>Thou mighty Lion, that art charged to keep</span>

				<span>But whither have I roved! who evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So from one topic to the other stray?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet think not I the road I kept before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have missed so far, but I can find my way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I said, the Syrians then observed the lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or arming like the Christians of that day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that Damascus’ crowded square was bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With corslet, plate, and helm of belted knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lovely ladies from their scaffolds throw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the jousters yellow flowers and red;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While these, as loud the brazen trumpets blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make their steeds leap and wheel and proudly tread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each, rode he well or ill, his art would show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the goring spur his courser bled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence this good cavalier earns fame and praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While others scornful hoots and laughter raise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A suit of arms was prize of the assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Presented to the king some days before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which late a merchant found upon the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning from Armenia; this the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grace, a vest, with noblest tissue gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Syrian king subjoined, so powdered o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With jewels, gold, and pearls in rich device,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They made the meed a thing of passing price.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If the good king had known the panoply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This he had held above all others dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this had given, as full of courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be contented for with sword and spear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere long to tell who so unworthily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had erst mistreated thus the goodly gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lay the way the harness had been strowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A prey to whosoever past the road.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of this you more in other place shall hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Gryphon now I tell, who at the just</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, saw broken many a knightly spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than one good stroke and one good thrust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eight were there who made league together, dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Norandine, and held in sovereign trust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Youths quick in arms and practised in the shock:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All lords, or scions of illustrious stock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At open barriers, one by one, the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They kept against all comers for a day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At first with lance, and next with sword or mace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While them the king delighted to survey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ofttimes they pierce the corslet’s iron case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every thing in fine perform in play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which foemen do that deadly weapons measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that the king may part them at his pleasure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That witless Antiochite, who, worthily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By name was cowardly Martano hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking, because his comrade, he must be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Partaker of the noble Gryphon’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the martial press rides valiantly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then stops; and the issue of a furious fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had begun between two cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wait, retiring from the strife, appears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seleucia’s lord, of those companions one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Combined in that emprize to keep the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who then a course with bold Ombruno run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wounded the unhappy warrior in mid-face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he slew him; mourned by every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who as a worthy knight the warrior grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And over and above his worth, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All others, hold him for his courteous lore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When vile Martano from his place discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fate which might be <em>his</em> with fearful eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into his craven nature be returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight began to think how he might fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him from flight the watchful Gryphon turned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, after much ado, with act and cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Urged him against a knight upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As at the ravening wolf men slip the hound;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who will pursue the brindled beast for ten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or twenty yards, and, after, stop to bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he beholds his flashing eyes, and when</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees the griesly beast his teeth display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas thus, before those valiant gentlemen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And princes, present there in fair array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearful Martano, seized with panic dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned to the right his courser’s rein and head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet he who would excuse the sudden wheel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his courser might the blame bestow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, after, he so ill his strokes did deal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Demosthenes his cause might well forego.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With paper armed he seems, and not with steel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So shrinks he at the wind of every blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length he breaks the ordered champions through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid loud laughter from the circling crew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Clapping of hands, and cries, at every turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were heard from all that rubble widely spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As a wolf sorely hunted makes return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To earth, to his retreat Martano fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon remained, and sullied with the scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed himself, which on his mate was shed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rather than be there, he, in his ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would gladly find himself i’ the midst of fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With burning heart, and visage red with shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thinks the knight’s disgrace is all his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because by deeds like his with whom he came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He weens the mob expects to see him known.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that it now behoves his valour flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More clear than light, or they, to censure prone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Errs he a finger’s breadth⁠—an inch⁠—will swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fault, and of that inch will make an ell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already he the lance upon his thigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has rested, little used to miss the foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then makes with flowing rein his courser fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next, somedeal advanced, directs the blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, smiting, puts to the last agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sidonia’s youthful lord, by him laid low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’ercome with wonder each assistant rises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom sore the unexpected deed surprises.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon returned, and did the weapon wield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whole and recovered, which he couched before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in three pieces broke it on the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which bold Laodicèa’s baron bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrice of four times about to press the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seemed, and lay along the crupper, sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astound; yet rose at length, unsheathed his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheeled his good courser, and at Gryphon made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon, who in his saddle sees the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Advancing towards him, nor unseated by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The encounter, says; “The failure of the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a few strokes the sabre shall supply;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on his temples smote a stroke so shear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed that it descended from the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And matched it with another, and again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another, till he stretched him on the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here two good brothers of Apamia were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In tourney wont to have the upper hand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Corimbo named and Thyrsis was the pair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both overturned by Gryphon on the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One at the encounter left his saddle bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the other Gryphon used his trenchant brand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> valiant knight was, in the common trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sure to obtain the honours of the just.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bold Salinterno, mid the warlike train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in the lists, vizier and marshal hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had the government of all that reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was, withal, a puissant man of might:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tourney’s prize he sees, with much disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About to be borne off by foreign knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lance he snatches, and to Gryphon cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him with many menaces defies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But he makes answer with a massy spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of ten others chosen as the best;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And levelling at the buckler of the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For greater surety, pierces plate and breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt rib and rib, it bored the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issuing a palm behind. To all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king excepted, welcome was the blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For each was greedy Salinterno’s foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two of Damascus next Sir Gryphon sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hermophilo and Carmondo. <em>This</em>, arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under his flag, the king’s militia led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> was as lord high admiral obeyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> lightly at the shock on earth was shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And <em>that</em>, reversed, upon the ground o’erlaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By his weak horse, too feeble to withstand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon’s mighty push and puissant hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet in the field remained Seleucia’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The best of all the other seven at need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one who well accompanied his might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With perfect armour and a gallant steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both at the helmet, where it locks, take sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with their spears to the encounter speed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Gryphon hardest smote, whose paynim foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost his left stirrup, staggered by the blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They cast the truncheons down, their coursers wheel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, full of daring, with drawn falchions close.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon was the first a stroke to deal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which might have split an anvil; at the blow’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descent, the shield is splintered⁠—bone and steel⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This had its lord mid thousand others chose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, but ’twas double, and the coat as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sword had cleft the thigh on which it fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He of Seleucia at Sir Gryphon’s casque,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the same time, so fell a blow addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It would have rent and torn the iron mask,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had it not been enchanted like the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim’s labour is a fruitless task,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of arms so hard Sir Gryphon is possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has the foe’s already cleft and broke</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In many parts, nor thrown away a stroke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each one might see how much Seleucia’s lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was overmatched by Gryphon, and that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The worsted men had perished by the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not the monarch quickly stopt the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his guard king Norandino spake the word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade them enter, and the duel stay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They part the knight, whom they asunder bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And much the king is lauded for his care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The eight, who had to keep the field pretended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all the world, nor yet their part had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a sole knight⁠—their quarrel ill defended⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had vanished from the tilt-yard one by one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The others, who with them should have contended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood idle; for to answer them was none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Gryphon had forestalled, in the debate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What they should all have done against those eight;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, for such little time endured the play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less than an hour sufficed to finish all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Norandine, the pastime to delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to continue it till even-fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descending from his place, bade clear the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the huge squad divided, at his call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into two troops, whom, ranked by blood and might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch formed, and marched for other fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Gryphon, during this, had made return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Homeward, with anger and with fury stung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less thinking of his honours that the scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on the vile Martano had been flung.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, from himself the opprobrious shame to turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martano now employs his lying tongue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, the false and cunning courtezan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assists him in his scheme as best she can.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether the youth believed the tale or no,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He the excuse received, like one discreet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed it best for them at once to go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And secretly and silently retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For fear, that if the populace should know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martano base, they him might ill entreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, by short ways and close, they quit the abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issue from the gates upon their road.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Gryphon, was he or his horse foredone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With toil, or was it sleep his eyes downweighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere yet the troop beyond two miles had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the first inn upon the highway stayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He doffed his armour all, and morion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had the steeds of trappings disarrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next alone he to a chamber sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Locked himself in, undrest, and went to bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No sooner he his head had rested there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than, with deep sleep opprest, he closed his eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So heavily, no badgers in their lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or dormice, overcome with slumber, lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martano and Origille, to take the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entered this while a garden which was nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there the strangest fraud together bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ever entered into mortal head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Martano schemed to take away the steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gear, in which Sir Gryphon had been dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stand before the monarch, in the weed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him who had in joust so proved his might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he had shaped in thought, he did the deed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took away the warrior’s horse, more white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than milk, his buckler, surcoat, arms, and crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all Sir Gryphon’s knightly ensigns drest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, who was clad in trappings not his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like the ass mantled in the lion’s hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he expected, to the king, unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was called in place of Gryphon: when descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Norandine, he rising from his throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embraced and kissed, and placed him by his side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deems enough to praise and hold him dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But wills that all around his praise should hear:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And bids them the sonorous metal blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proclaiming him the conqueror of that day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And round about loud voices, high and low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unworthy name throughout the lists convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wills that, side by side, with him shall go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight, when homeward he shall take his way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him such favour shows, intent to please,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might have honoured Mars or Hercules.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him lodgings fair he gave, wherein to dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At court; and she who with the peer did ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was honoured by the courteous king as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—False Origille⁠—with knight and page supplied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But it is time that I of Gryphon tell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who unsuspecting, she, or wight beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him would with treacherous stratagem deceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had fallen asleep, nor ever waked till eve.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he how late it was, awaking, knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With speed he from the chamber did withdraw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hastened where he, with the other crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left Origille and her false brother-in-law:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when, nor these, nor, upon better view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His armour nor his wonted clothes he saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspicious waxed; and more suspicion bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ensigns of his comrade left instead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host, arriving, him at full possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of every thing⁠—and how, in white array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That warrior, with the lady and the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had to the city measured back their way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By little and by little, Gryphon guessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What love from him had hidden till that day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knew, to his great sorrow, in the other</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Origille’s paramour, and not her brother.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now he lamenting for his folly stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That having heard the truths the pilgrim said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should have let her story change his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him before so often had betrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He might have venged himself, nor did:⁠—now wou’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too late, inflict the punishment delayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constrained (a crying error!) in his need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take that wily treachour’s arms and steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He better would have gone like naked man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than braced the unworthy cuirass on his breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or hastened the detested shield to span,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or place upon his helm the scorned crest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But of the lover, and that courtezan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, passion mastering reason, took the quest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bending to Damascus’ gate his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived an hour before the close of day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the left hand a castle richly dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood nigh the gate, to which Sir Gryphon rode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides, that it was strong and armed for fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filled with rare chambers was the rich abode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first of Syria, king, and lord, and knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lady, in a gentle group bestowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There in an open gallery fairly met,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were at their glad and costly supper set.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the high tower the beauteous gallery, clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the city-wall, projected out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence might be discovered, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spacious fields and different roads about.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Gryphon now, in his opprobrious gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And arms, dishonoured by the rabble’s flout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes, by ill fortune, to the gate resort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He by the king is seen, and all his court;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, taken for the man whose crest he wears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In dame and knight moves laughter, through the ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vile Martano, as a man who shares</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The royal grace, sits next below the king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next, she, whom her love so fitly pairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Norandino gaily questioning.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Demands of them, who is the coward knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That of his honour makes so passing light;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who, after feat so base and foul, anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approaches, with such front and shameless cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And cries, “It seems a thing unheard, that you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An excellent and worthy cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should take this man for your companion, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has not in all our wide Levant his peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did you with him for contrast-sake combine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That so your valour might more brightly shine?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“⁠—But did not love for you my will restrain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the eternal gods, I truly swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should endure such ignominious stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As I am wont to make his fellows share:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him would I make of my long-nursed disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of cowardice perpetual record bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you, by whom he hither was conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If now unpunished, let his thanks be paid.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That vessel of all filthy vices, he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made answer: “Mighty sir, I cannot say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is the stranger, that fell in with me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Journeying from Antioch hither, by the way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him I worthy of my company</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed, by his warlike semblance led astray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I nothing of his deeds have heard or seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save what ill feats to-day have witnessed been;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Which moved me so, it little lacked but I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For punishment of his unworthy fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had put him out of case again to ply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In martial tournament, the sword or spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, but in reverence to your majesty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And presence, I forbore by hand to rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not for his sake:⁠—nor by thy mercy showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him, as my companion on the road;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whose former fellowship appears a stain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever ’twill sit heavy at my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I, uninjured, see the wretch again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Scape, to the scandal of the warlike art.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere better he from tower, a worthy pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were gibbeted, than suffered to depart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hung as a beacon for the coward’s gaze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such were a princely deed, and worthy praise.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A voucher he in Origilla had,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who well, without a sign, his purpose read.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I deem not,” cried the king, “his works so bad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they should cost the stranger knight his head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough that he again the people glad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For penance of his weighty sin.” This said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He quickly called a baron of his crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him enjoined the deed he was to do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With many armed men that baron fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the city-gate descending, here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Collects his troop, and for the attempt prepares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waiting the coming of the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him surprises so at unawares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, softly, ’twixt two bridges, takes the peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him detains, with mockery and scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a dark chamber, till returning morn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The early sun had scarce his golden hair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplifted from his ancient nurse’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beginning, upon Alpine regions bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To chase the shades and gild the mountain-crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Martan’, fearing Gryphon might declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wrong, and to the king the truth attest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Retorting upon him the slander cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took leave, and thence upon his journey past.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His ready wit a fit excuse supplies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why he stays not, to see the recreant shown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is with other gifts, beside the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rewarded for the victory, not his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And letters patent, drawn in ample wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein his lofty honours wide are blown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him depart; I promise he shall meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A guerdon worthy of his treacherous feat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon is brought with shame into the square,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When it is fully thronged with gazing wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom they of cuirass and of helmet bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leave in simple cassock, meanly dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as to slaughter he conducted were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Place on a wain, conspicuous to the sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harnessed to which two sluggish cows are seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weary and weak, and with long hunger lean.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thronging about the ignoble car, appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brazen-faced boy and girl of evil fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, each in turn, will play the charioteer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all assail the knight with bitter blame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The boys might be a cause of greater fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, joined to mocks and mows, and words of shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior they with volleyed stones would slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the wiser few their fury stay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That which of his disgrace had been the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though no true evidence of guilt, his mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plate, are dragged in due dishonour round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspended at the shameful waggon’s tail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wain is stopt, and to the trumpet’s sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heralds, in front of a tribunal’s pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shame, before his eyes, amid the crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Another’s evil deed) proclaim aloud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They take their prisoner thence, and so repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In front of temple, dwelling-house, and store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any cruel name of mockery spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor leave unsaid a word of filthy lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him at last without the city bear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foolish rabble, trusting evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their thrall to banish to the sound of blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who passing little of its prisoner knows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warrior’s gyves no sooner they undo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from their manacles free either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Gryphon seizes shield and sword, and, through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rabble, makes long furrows with his brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pike and spear unfurnished was the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who without weapons came, a witless band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest for other canto I suspend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, sir, ’tis time this song should have an end.</span>

			</header>
			<p>
				<span>High minded lord! your actions evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have with reason lauded, and still laud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I with style inapt, and rustic lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You of large portion of your praise defraud:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, of your many virtues, one before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All others I with heart and tongue applaud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That, if each man a gracious audience finds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No easy faith your equal judgment blinds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Often, to shield the absent one from blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hear you this, or other, thing adduce;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or him you let, at least, an audience claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where still one ear is open to excuse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And before dooming men to scaith and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see and hear them ever is your use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ere you judge another, many a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And month, and year, your sentence to delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had Norandine been with your care endued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What he by Gryphon did, he had not done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Profit and fame have from your rule accrued;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stain more black than pitch he cast upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His name: through him, his people were pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put to death by Olivero’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who at ten cuts or thrusts, in fury made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some thirty dead about the waggon laid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whither fear drives, in rout, the others all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some scattered here, some there, on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fill road and field; to gain the city-wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some strive, and smothered in the mighty tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One on another, in the gateway fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon, all thought of pity laid aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threats not nor speaks, but whirls his sword about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well venging on the crowd their every flout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of those who to the portal foremost fleed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The readiest of the crowd their feet to ply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Part, more intent upon their proper need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than their friends’ peril, raise the drawbridge high:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Part, weeping and with deathlike visage, speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor turn their eyes behind them as they fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While, through the ample city, outcry loud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And noise, and tumult rises from the crowd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two nimble Gryphon seizes, mid the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to their woe the bridge is raised; of one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the field the warrior strews the brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he beats out on a hard grinding stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seized by the breast, the other of the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over the city-wall by him is thrown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fear chills the townsmen’s marrow, when they spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The luckless wretch descending from the sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many there were who feared in their alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest o’er the wall Sir Gryphon would have vaulted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor greater panic seized upon those swarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if the sultan had the town assaulted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sound of running up and down, of arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of cry of Muezzins, on high exalted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of drums and trumpets, heaven, ’twould seem, rebounded,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that the world was by the noise confounded.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But I will to another time delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What chanced on this occasion, to recount.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis meet I follow Charles upon his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurrying in search of furious Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who did the monarch’s suffering people slay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I said, with him, the danger to affront,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went Namus, Oliver, the Danish peer,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-225" id="noteref-225" epub:type="noteref">225</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avino, Avolio, Otho and Berlinghier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eight lances’ shock, that eight such warriors guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which all at once against the king they rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endured the stout and scaly serpent’s hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which the cruel Moor his limbs had drest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As a barque rights itself⁠—the sheet untied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which held its sail⁠—by growing wind opprest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So speedily Sir Rodomont arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though a hill had been uprooted by the blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rainier and Guido, Richard, Salomon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ivan, Ughetto, Turpin, and the twain⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angiolin, Angelier⁠—false Ganellon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Mark and Matthew from <abbr>St.</abbr> Michael’s plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the eight of whom I spake, all set upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foe, with Edward and Sir Arimane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who leading succours from the English shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had lodged them in the town short time before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not so, well-keyed into the solid stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Groans upon Alpine height the castle good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When by rude Boreas’ rage or Eurus’ strown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uptorn are ash and fir in mountain-wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As groans Sir Rodomont, with pride o’erblown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed with anger and with thirst of blood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as the thunder and the lightning’s fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fly coupled, such his vengeance and his ire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He at <em>his</em> head took aim who stood most nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ughetto was the miserable wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom to the teeth he clove, and left to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though of good temper was his helmet bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well the others many strokes let fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At him, himself; which all the warrior smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But harm (so hard the dragon’s hide) no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than needle can the solid anvil score.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All the defences, round, abandoned are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unpeopled city is abandoned all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, where the danger is the greater, there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The many give their aid, at Charles’ call:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through every street they hurry to the square,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since flying nought avails, from work and wall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their bosoms so the monarch’s presence warms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That each again takes courage, each takes arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when within the closely-fastened cage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of an old lioness, well used to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An untamed bull is prisoned, to engage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The savage monster, for the mob’s delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cubs, who see him cresting in his rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And round the den loud-bellowing, to the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the huge beast’s enormous horns unused,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cower at a distance, timid and confused;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But if the mother spring at him, and hang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixing her cruel tusks into his ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her whelps as well will blood their greedy fang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, bold in her defence, assail the steer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One bites his paunch, and one his back: so sprang</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That band upon the paynim cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From roof and window, and from place more nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poured in a ceaseless shower, the weapons fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of cavaliers and footmen such the squeeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hardly can the place the press contain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They cluster there as thick as swarming bees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thither from each passage troop amain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that, were they unarmed, and with more ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than stalks or turnips he could cleave the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill Rodomont in twenty days would clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gathering crowd, united far and near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unknowing how himself from thence to free,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-226" id="noteref-226" epub:type="noteref">226</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim by this game is angered sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who little thins the gathering rabblery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Staining the ground with thousands slain or more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the while, in his extremity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds that his breath comes thicker than before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sees he cannot pierce the hostile round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless he thence escape while strong and sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monarch rolls about his horrid eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sees that foes all outlets barricade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, at the cost of countless enemies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A path shall quickly by his hand be made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Fury calls him, lo! the felon hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And brandishes on high his trenchant blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To assail the newly entered British band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Edward and Sir Ariman command.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He who has seen the fence, in well-thronged square,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Against whose stakes the eddying crowd is born)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By wild bull broken, that has had to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the long day, dogs, blows, and ceaseless scorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hunts the scattered people here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this, or that, now hoists upon his horn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him as such, or fiercer yet, account,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he breaks forth, the cruel Rodomont.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At one cross-blow fifteen or twenty foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hews, as many leaves without a bead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At cross or downright-stroke; as if he rows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trashes in vineyard or in willow-bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last all smeared with blood the paynim goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safe from the place, which he has heaped with dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wheresoe’er he turns his steps, are left</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heads, arms, and other members, maimed and cleft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He from the square retires in such a mode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None can perceive that danger him appals;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, during this, what were the safest road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which to sally, he to thought recals.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He comes at last to where the river flowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Below the isle, and past without the walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In daring men at arms and mob increase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who press him sore, nor let him part in peace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the high-couraged beast, whom hunters start</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the wild Nomade or Massilian chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, even in flying, shows his noble heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And threatening seeks his lair with sluggish pace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that strange wood of sword, and spear, and dart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turns Rodomont, with action nothing base;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still impeded by the galling foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes for the river with long steps and slow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He turned upon the rabble-rout who bayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind him, thrice or more, by anger driven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stained anew his falchion, by whose blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than a hundred deadly wounds were given.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But reason, finally, his fury stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the bloody carnage stank to heaven;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-227" id="noteref-227" epub:type="noteref">227</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, with better counsel, from the side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast himself down into Seine’s foaming tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Athwart the current swam, with arms and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if by corks upborn, the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though thou Antaeus bred’st, and Hannibal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O Africa! thou never bred’st his peer!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When now across the stream, without the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turned, and saw the royal town appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—To have traversed all the city moved his ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving it undestroyed by sword or fire;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And him so sorely anger stung and pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither he thought a second time to go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his inmost bosom groaned and sighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would depart until he laid it low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he saw one along the river-side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approach, who made him rage and hate forego;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strait shall you hear who ’twas, approached the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first I have to say of other thing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have of haughty Discord now to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom the archangel Michael gave command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To heat to enmity and fierce affray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The best of Agramant’s besieging band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She went that evening from the abbey gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her task committing to another’s hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Left it to Fraud to feed, till her return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The war, and make the fires she kindled burn;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she believed, that she with greater power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should go, did Pride with her as well repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she (for all were guested in one bower)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In search of her had little way to fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pride went with her; but, that in hall or tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A vicar too her charge might duly bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She for those days she absent thought to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her lieutenant left Hypocrisy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-228" id="noteref-228" epub:type="noteref">228</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The implacable Discord went, and with the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Companion of the enterprise, was Pride)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her road; and found that, by the same,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was journeying to the paynim camp, beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Comfortless Jealousy, with whom there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A little dwarf, attending as a guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who erst had been sent forward with advice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Sarza’s king, by beauteous Doralice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she fell into Mandricardo’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I have before recounted when and where)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had in secret given the dwarf command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to the king should with the tidings fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom she hoped not vainly would be scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tale her messenger was charged to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But wonderous deeds be done for her relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sad and signal vengeance on the thief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Jealousy had that little dwarf espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kenned the reason of his mission too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joined him, journeying with him side by side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming that she therein a part might do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discord, with pleasure, Jealousy decried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with more joy, when she the occasion knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which thither brought the dame, who much (she wist)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might in the task she had in hand assist.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of means to embroil the Sarzan and the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Agrican,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-229" id="noteref-229" epub:type="noteref">229</a> she deems herself possest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A certain mode to enrage these two is won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other means may work upon the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thither with the dwarfish page is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the fierce Pagan in his clutch had prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proud Paris; and they reached the river-strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exactly as the felon swam to land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as the redoubted Rodomont</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew in the dwarf the courier of his dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He all his rage extinguished, cleared his front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And felt his courage brighten into flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All else he deems the courier may recount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that a wight had wrought him scaith and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cries (encountering him with cheerful brow)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How fares our lady? wither sent art thou?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor mine nor thine that lady will I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is another’s thrall,” the dwarf replied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“We, on our road, encountered yesterday</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A knight, who seized and bore away the bride.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Jealousy, upon this, took up the play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, cold as asp, embraced the king: her guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued his tale, relating how the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their mistress taken, by one man were slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her flint and steel, fell Discord, as he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took forth, and somewhile hammered on the stone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pride, underneath, the ready tinder spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the quick fire was in a moment blown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This on the paynim’s soul so fiercely fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not find a resting place: ’mid groan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sob he storms, with horrid face and eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which threat the elements and ample sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As tiger rages, who in vain descends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into her den, and finds herself alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, circling all the cavern, comprehends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last, that her beloved young are gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To ire, to rage like hers his wrath extends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor night the king regards, nor rock, nor stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor stream:⁠—Nor length of way nor storm arrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The speed with which he on the plunderer prest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So raging, to the pygmy dwarf who bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The news, exclaimed the king, “Now hence away!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor horse he waits, nor carriage, nor, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departing, deigns to <em>his</em> a word to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hurries with such speed, that not with more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lizard darts at noon across the way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Horse had he none, but be he whose he might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would make his own the first which came in sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discord at this, who read his secret thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed, as she looked smilingly on Pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Through her he to a courser should be brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which new cause of strife should be supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, that by him no other might be caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from his path would keep all steeds beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knew already where the prize to seek.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—But her I leave, again of Charles to speak.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, on the Saracen’s departure, spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About King Charles, was the consuming flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ranged his troops anew: some warriors went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To strengthen feeble posts which succours claim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest against the Saracens are sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give the foe checkmate and end the game;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from Saint German’s to Saint Victor’s gates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He pours the host, which on his signal waits.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He these at Saint Marcellus’ gate, where lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outstretched a large circumference of plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade one another wait, in one array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To reunite against the paynim train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflaming every one to smite and slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In guise, that for a record should remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made the various troops fall in below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their banners, and the battle-signal blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant has remounted in his sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While this is doing in his foe’s despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the stripling<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-230" id="noteref-230" epub:type="noteref">230</a> who loved Isabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is waging perilous and fearful fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio with Sobrino strives as well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo a troop encounters, whom the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Valour and with Fortune for his guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charges, and breaks, and routs on every side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While so the battle stands, king Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Falls on the rear guard of the paynim foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where bold Marsilius halts the flower of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And forms the host, his royal flag below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On these king Charlemagne impels his train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, foot with horse to flank, against them go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While so the deafening drum and trumpet sounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem the spacious world the din rebounds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Saracenic squadrons had begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bend, and all the army of the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had turned, disordered, broken, and undone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never to be arrayed or rallied more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that Grandonio stood, and Falsiron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tried oftentimes in greater ill before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Serpentine and Balugantes proud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the renowned Ferraù, who cried aloud:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O valiant men,” he⁠—“O companions,” cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O brethren, stand, and yet your place maintain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like cobweb-threads our cruel enemies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will find their works, if we our part sustain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What this day Fortune offers to our eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If now we conquer, see the praise, the gain!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If conquered, see the utter loss and shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which will for ever wait upon your name!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He in this time a mighty lance had spanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spurred at once against Sir Berlinghier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who Argaliffa guided with his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And broke his helmet’s frontal with the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast him on earth, and with the cruel brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unhorsed perhaps eight other warriors near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His mighty strokes discharging, at each blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ever laid at least one horseman low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In other part, Rinaldo, in his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has slain more enemies than I can say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the warlike knight no order stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You might have seen the ample camp give way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less Zerbino and Lurcanio good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do deeds, which will be told in every day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em>, with a thrust, has bold Balastro slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> Finaduro’s helm has cleft in twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The first was of the Alzerban army head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ruled by Tardocco some short time before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other one the valiant squadrons led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Saphi, and Morocco, and Zamor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Where, ’mid the paynims,” might to me be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Is knight whose sword can cleave or lance can gore?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But step by step I go, and as I wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My way, leave none who merits praise behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zumara’s king is not forgotten here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dardinel, who Sir Dulphin of the mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Claude of the wood, and Hubert, with the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Of Mirford he) and Elio did dismount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with the faulchion, Stamford’s cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Anselm, Raymond and Sir Pinnamont</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From London-town; though valiant were the twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two stunned, one wounded, the four others slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet will his squadron not so firmly stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Maugre the valour which his deeds display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So firmly, as to wait the Christian band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In number less, but steadier in array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More used to joust and manage of the brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all things appertaining to the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Setta and Morocco turned, and seized, with dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zumara and Canaries’ islesmen fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But faster than the rest Alzerba flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Dardinel opposed, and now with sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reproach, and now with prayer he moves, and tries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What best he deems their courage may restore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If good Almontes has deserved,” he cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That you should by his memory set such store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now shall be seen⁠—be seen, if you will me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His son, abandon in such jeopardy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For sake of my green youth, I pray you stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That youth whereon your hopes were wont to feed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And suffer not that, scattered by the brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Africa be lost our noble seed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save you united go, be sure the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is shut against you, wheresoe’er you speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too high a wall to climb is mountain-steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The yawning sea a ditch too wide to leap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Far better ’tis to perish than to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Torn by these dogs, or lie at their control.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since vain is every other remedy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wait, friends, for love of Heaven, the advancing shoal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They are not gifted with more lives than we;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have but one pair of hands, have but one soul.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, the bold youth, amid the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of enemies, the Earl of Huntley slew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almontes’ memory, through the Moorish bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes every bosom with such ardour glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They deem ’tis better to use arms and hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fight, than turn their backs upon the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taller than all William of Burnwich stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An Englishman, whom Dardinel brings low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And equals with the rest; then smites upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleaves, the head of Cornish Aramon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Down fell this Aramon, and to afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him succour, thitherward his brother made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from the shoulder him Zumara’s lord<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-231" id="noteref-231" epub:type="noteref">231</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleft to the fork, with his descending blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next Bogio de Vergalla’s belly gored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his debt absolved (the forfeit paid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to return within six months, if life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were granted him, had promised to his wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lurcanio next met Dardinello’s eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He upon earth Dorchino had laid low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pierced through the throat, and hapless Gardo nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleft to the teeth; at him, as all too slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from Altheus vainly seeks to fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom as his heart Lurcanio loves, a blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his head behind the Scotchman speeds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, slaughtered by the stroke, the warrior bleeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dardinel, to avenge him, took a spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, should he lay the fierce Lurcanio dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vowed to his Mahomet, if he could hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mosque should have his empty arms; this said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ranging the field in haste, that cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in the flank, with thrust so full and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encountered, that it went through either side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he to his to strip the baron cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From me it sure were needless to demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Ariodantes, when his brother fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was grieved; if he with his avenging hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the damned would send Sir Dardinell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all access the circling troops withstand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bar, no less baptised than infidel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet would he venge himself, and with his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here, now there, an open passage made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He charges, chases, breaks, and overthrows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whoever cross him on the crowded plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Dardinello, who his object knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fain the wish content; but him the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impedes as well, which round about him flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And renders aye his every purpose vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If one on all sides thins the Moorish rank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other slays Scot, Englishman, and Frank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fortune still blocked their path throughout the day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they met not, ’mid that chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kept one as a mightier champion’s prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For rarely man escapes his destiny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold the good Rinaldo turns that way!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, for this one no refuge there might be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! good Rinaldo comes: him Fortune guides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for his sword King Dardinel provides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But here enough for this one while is shown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of their illustrious doings in the west;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis time I seek Sir Gryphon, and make known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he, with fury burning in his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That rabble-rout had broke and overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struck with more fear than ever men possest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither speeds Norandine on that alarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for his guard above a thousand arm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Norandine, girt with peer and knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing on every side the people fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rides to the gates, with squadron duly dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at his hest the portals open fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile Sir Gryphon, having put to flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weak and worthless rabble far and nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The scorned arms (to keep him from that train),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as they were, took up and donned again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And nigh a temple strongly walled, and round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose base a moat for its protection goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a little bridge takes up his ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That him his enemies may not enclose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! loudly shouting, and with threatening sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mighty squadron through the gateway flows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant Gryphon changes not his place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shows how small his fear by act and face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when, approaching near, he saw the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sallied forth to meet them by the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wielding still his sword in either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made cruel havoc in the close array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then on the narrow bridge resumed his stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor there his hunters only held at bay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew he sallied, and returned anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye leaving bloody signs when he withdrew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forestroke and back he deals, and on the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Horsemen and foot o’erthrows on every side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while the ample mob the knight surround,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more and more the warfare rages wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length Sir Gryphon fears he shall be drowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So waxed their numbers) in the increasing tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hurt in the left shoulder, through his mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thigh, his wind as well begins to fail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Valour, who so oft befriends her own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes him find grace in Norandino’s eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, while alarmed, he hurries there, o’erthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many men, such heaps of dead espies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he views wounds, which Hector’s hand alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He weens could deal⁠—to him all testifies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he had put an undeserved shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a cavalier of mighty name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next seeing him more near, whose falchion’s sweep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had dealt such deaths amid his chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And raised about himself that horrid heap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stained the water with that bloody dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thought that he beheld Horatius keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Singly, the bridge against all Tuscany;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vext, and anxious to remove the stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Recalled his men, and that with little pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, lifting his bare hand, in sign affied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From ancient times, of treaty and of truce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repenting him, he to Sir Gryphon cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“It grieves me sorely, and I cannot choose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But own my sin: let counsels which misguide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And my own little wit, such fault excuse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What by the vilest knight I thought to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I to the best on earth have done in you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And though the bitter injuries and shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That have to thee through ignorance been done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are equalled, and all cancelled by thy fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And merged, in truth, in glory thou hast won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever satisfaction thou canst claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within my power or knowledge, count upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I know how atonement may be made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By city, castle, or by money paid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Demand of me this kingdom’s moiety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from this day thou its possessor art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since not alone thy worth deserves this fee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But merits, I with this should give my heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, pledge of faith and lasting love, to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the meanwhile, thy friendly hand impart.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, from his horse the king descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And towards Gryphon his right-hand extended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he beheld the monarch’s altered cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bent to clasp his neck, towards him paced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sword and rancour laid aside, the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him humbly underneath the hips embraced.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-232" id="noteref-232" epub:type="noteref">232</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Norandine, who saw the sanguine smear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his two wounds, bade seek a leech in haste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade them softly with the knight resort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the town, and lodge him in his court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, wounded, he remained some days before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could bear arms: but him, in the design</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of seeking out Sir Aquilant once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good Astolpho, left in Palestine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I quit; they vainly did his path explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After Sir Gryphon left the holy shrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through Solyma in every place of note,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many, from the Holy Land remote.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One and the other are alike to seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the inquiry where the knight may use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But they encounter with the pilgrim-Greek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of false Origilla gives them news;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relating, as of her he haps to speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That towards Antioch she her way pursues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By a new leman of that city charmed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who her with fierce and sudden flame had warmed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aquilant asked him, if he had possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon of the news to them conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, hearing that he <em>had</em>, surmised the rest⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he was gone, and by what motive swayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He followed Origille, was manifest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had in quest of her for Antioch made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take her from his rival, and with view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him some memorable scathe to do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aquilant brooked not Gryphon such a feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without him, and alone, should thus assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And took his armour and pursued his beat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first besought the duke he would delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To visit France and his paternal seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he from Antioch measured back his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Joppa he embarks, who deems by sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The better and securer way to be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the south-east upsprung so strong a breeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which for Gryphon’s galley blew so right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the third day he Tyre’s famed city sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lesser Joppa quick succeeds to sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Zibellotto and Baruti flees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cyprus to larboard left) the galley light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Tripoli to Tortosa shapes her way,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-233" id="noteref-233" epub:type="noteref">233</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so to Lizza and Lajazzo’s bay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From thence, towards the east the pilot veered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her ready tiller, prompt his course to scan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straightway for the wide Orontes steered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And watched his time, and for the harbour ran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aquilant, when his bark the margin neared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade lower the bridge, and issued, horse and man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It armour, and along the river wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up-stream, till he his way at Antioch ended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To inform himself of that Martano bent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heard that he to Antioch was addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Origilla, where a tournament</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was to be solemnized by royal hest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To track whom Aquilant was so intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assured that Gryphon had pursued his quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He Antioch left again that very day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not by sea again would take his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He towards Lidia and Larissa goes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-234" id="noteref-234" epub:type="noteref">234</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—At rich Aleppo makes a longer stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God, to make plain that he, even here, bestows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On evil and on good their fitting pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At a league’s distance from Mamuga, throws</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martano in the avenging brother’s way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martano travelling with the tourney’s prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Displayed before his horse in showy wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Aquilant believed, at the first show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His brother he in vile Martano spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For arms and vest, more white than virgin snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The coward in the warrior’s sight belied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sprang towards him, with that joyful “Oh!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which delight is ever signified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But changed his look and tone, when, nearer brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees that he is not the wight he sought:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And through that evil woman’s treachery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed Gryphon murdered by the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, “Tell me,” he exclaimed, “thou, who must be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Traitor and thief⁠—both written in thy cheer⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence are these arms? and wherefore do I thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">View on the courser of my brother dear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say is my brother slaughtered or alive?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How didst thou him of horse and arms deprive?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Origilla hears him, in affright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She turns her palfrey, and for flight prepares:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Aquilant, more quick, in her despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrests the traitress, ere she further fares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the loud threats of that all furious knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom he so was taken unawares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martan’ turns pale and trembles like a leaf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor how to act or answer knows the thief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aquilant thundered still, and, to his dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A falchion, pointed at his gullet, shewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And swore with angry menaces, the head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him and Origille should be hewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save in all points the very truth be said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Awhile on this ill-starred Martano chewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Revolving still what pretext he might try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lessen his grave fault, then made reply:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Know, sir, you see my sister in this dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one of good and virtuous parents born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though she has lately led a life of shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And been by Gryphon foully brought to scorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for I loathed such blot upon our name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet weened that she could ill by force be torn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From such a puissant wight, I laid a scheme</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her by address and cunning to redeem.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With her I planned the means, who in her breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nursed the desire a better life to prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she, when Gryphon was retired to rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In silence from the warrior should remove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This done: lest he should follow on our quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so undo the web we vainly wove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him we deprived of horse and arm, and we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are hither come together, as you see.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His cunning might have proved of good avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Aquilant believed him easily;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, save in taking Gryphon’s horse and mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to the knight had done no injury;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he wrought so high the specious tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As manifested plainly, ’twas a lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all ’twas perfect, save that he the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had for his sister vouched with whom he came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aquilant had in Antioch chanced to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She was his concubine⁠—well certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this by many⁠—and in furious glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed; “Thou falsest robber, thou hast lied!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dealt, with that, the recreant such a blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He drove two grinders down his throat; then tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Not sought Martano with his foe to cope)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The caitiff’s arms behind him with a rope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, though she for excuse tried many wiles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did thus as well by Origille untrue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And till he reached Damascus’ lofty piles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them by town, street, or farm, behind him drew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will a thousand times a thousand miles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sorrow and with suffering, drag the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he his brother find; who, at his pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May vengeance to the guilty couple measure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Aquilant made squires and beasts as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return with him, and to Damascus came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heard Renown, throughout the city, swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plying her ample wings, Sir Gryphon’s name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, great and little⁠—every one, could tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas he that in the tourney won such fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had, by one that ill deserved his trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Been cheated of the honours of the just.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pointing him out to one another’s sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hostile people all Martano bayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And is not this (they cried) that ribald wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in another’s spoils himself arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who the valour of a sleeping knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his own shame and infamy o’erlaid?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this the woman of ungrateful mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who aids the wicked and betrays the good?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Others exclaimed, “How fittingly combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marked with one stamp, and of one race are they!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some loudly cursed them, and some raved behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While others shouted, “Hang, burn, quarter, slay!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The throng to view them prest, with fury blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the square before them made its way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch of the tidings was advised,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these above another kingdom prized.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Attended with few squires the Syrian king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As then he chanced to be, came forth with speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with Sir Aquilant encountering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who Gryphon had avenged with worthy deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him honoured with fair cheer, and home would bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in his palace lodged, as fitting meed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having the prisoned pair, with his consent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First in the bottom of a turret pent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither they go, where Gryphon from his bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has not as yet, since he was wounded, stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who at his brother’s coming waxes red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surmising well he of his case has heard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after Aquilant his say had said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him somedeal reproached, the three conferred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to what penance to the wicked two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fallen into their hands, was justly due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis Aquilant’s, ’tis Norandino’s will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand tortures shall their guerdon be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Gryphon, who the dame <em>alone</em> can ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excuse, entreats for <em>both</em> impunity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many matters urges with much skill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But well is answered; and ’tis ruled, to flea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martano’s body with the hangman’s scourge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And only short of death his penance urge.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bound is the wretch, but not ’mid grass and flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose limbs beneath the hangman’s lashes burn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the next morn: they prison in the tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Origilla, till Lucina shall return;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom the counselling lords reserve the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To speak the woman’s sentence, mild or stern.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harboured, till Gryphon can bear arms, at court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aquilant fleets the time in fair disport.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The valiant Norandino could not choose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Made by such error temperate and wise),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But full of penitence and sorrow, muse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With downcast spirit, and in mournful guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On having bid his men a knight misuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom all should worthily reward and prize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he, night and morning, in his thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How to content the injured warrior sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he determined, in the public sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’ the city, guilty of that injury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all such honour as to perfect knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could by a puissant monarch rendered be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him with the glorious guerdon to requite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had been ravished by such treachery:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence, within a month, proclaimed the intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hold another solemn tournament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For which he made what stately preparation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was possible to make by sceptered king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence Fame divulged the royal proclamation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout all Syria’s land, with nimble wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Phoenicia and Palestine; till the relation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this in good Astolpho’s ears did ring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, with the lord who ruled that land in trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved he would be present at the just.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For a renowned and valiant cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has the true history vaunted, Sansonnet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Roland christened, Charles (I said), the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over the Holy Land as ruler set:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with the duke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-235" id="noteref-235" epub:type="noteref">235</a> takes up his load, to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where Rumour speaks the champions met.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that his ears, on all sides in the journey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are filled with tidings of Damascus’ tourney.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither the twain their way those countries through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By easy stages and by slow, addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fresh upon the day of joust the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might in Damascus-town set up their rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When at the meeting of cross-ways they view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A person, who, in movement and in vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appears to be a man, but is a maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And marvellously fierce, in martial raid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa was the warlike virgin’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such her worth, she oft with naked brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had pressed Orlando sore in martial game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him who had Mount Alban in command;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-236" id="noteref-236" epub:type="noteref">236</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever, night and day, the armed dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scowered, here and there, by hill and plain, the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping with errant cavalier to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And win immortal fame by glorious feat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Sansonnetto and the English knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She sees approaching her, in warlike weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seem two valiant warriors in her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As of large bone, and nerved for doughty deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On them she fain would prove her martial might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to defy the pair has moved her steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, eyeing the two warriors, now more near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa recognized the duke and peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His pleasing ways she did in mind retrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When arms in far Catày with her he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Called him by name, nor would in iron case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Retain her hand, upraised the casque she wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him, advanced, to meet with glad embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though, of all living dames and those of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The proudest, she; nor with less courteous mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin salutes the martial queen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They questioned one another of their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when the duke has said (who first replied)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he Damascus seeks, where to assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their virtuous deeds, all knights of valour tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Syrian king invites, in martial play,”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bold Marphisa, at his hearing, cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Ever to prove her warlike prowess bent)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I will be with you at this tournament.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To have such a comrade either cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is much rejoiced. They to Damascus go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a suburb, of the city clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are lodged, upon the day before the show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, till her aged lover, once so dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aurora roused, their humble roof below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In greater ease the weary warriors rested</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than had they been in costly palace guested.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when the clear and lucid sun again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its shining glories all abroad had spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous lady armed, and warriors twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having first couriers to the city sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when ’twas time, reported to the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, to see truncheons split in contest dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Norandine had come into the square</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which the cruel games appointed were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Straight to the city ride the martial band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, through the high-street, to the crowded place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, waiting for the royal signal, stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ranged here and there, the knights of gentle race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The guerdons destined to the conqueror’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that day’s tourney, were a tuck and mace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Richly adorned, and, with them, such a steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to the winning lord were fitting meed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Norandine, sure that, in the martial game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both prizes destined for the conquering knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as one and the other tourney’s fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must be obtained by Gryphon, named the white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give him all that valiant man could claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could he give the warrior less, with right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The armour, guerdon of this final course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Placed with the tuck and mace and noble horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The arms which in the former joust the due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of valiant Gryphon were, who all had gained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(With evil profit, by the wretch untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martan’ usurped, who Gryphon’s bearing feigned,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be hung up on high in public view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the rich-flourished tuck, the king ordained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fastened at the saddle of the steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mace, that Gryphon might win either meed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But from effecting what he had intended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was prevented by the warlike maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who late into the crowded square had wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Sansonnet and England’s duke arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing the arms of which I spoke suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She straight agnized the harness she surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once hers, and dear to her; as matters are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed by us as excellent and rare;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though, as a hindrance, she upon the road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had left the arms, when, to retrieve her sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from her shoulders slipt the ponderous load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chased Brunello, worthy of the cord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More to relate were labour ill bestowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem, nor further of the tale record.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-237" id="noteref-237" epub:type="noteref">237</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough for me, by you ’tis understood,</span>

				<span class="i1">How here she found anew her armour good.</span>

			<p>
				<span>You shall take with you, when by manifest</span>

				<span class="i1">And certain tokens they by her were known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, for no earthly thing, the iron vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And weapons for a day would have foregone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thinks not if this mode or that be best</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have them, anxious to regain her own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But t’wards the arms with hand extended hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And without more regard takes down the prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And throwing some on earth, it chanced that more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than was her own she in her hurry took.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Syrian king, who was offended sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised war against her with a single look.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ill the wrong his angered people bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to avenge him, lance and falchion shook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remembering not, on other day, how dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They paid for scathing errant cavalier.</span>

				<span>No wishful child more joyfully, ’mid all</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dame beauteous and adorned, than ’mid the tread</span>

				<span class="i1">Of warlike steeds, and din of arms, and fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of darts, and push of spears⁠—where blood is shed,</span>

				<span class="i1">And death is dealt, in the tumultuous throng⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>She</b> finds herself beyond all credence strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spurred her courser, and with lance in rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imperious at the foolish rabble made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—through the neck impaled or through the breast⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some pierced, some prostrate at the encounter layed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next this or that she with the falchion prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The head from one she severed with the blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from that other cleft: another sank,</span>

				<span class="i1">Short of right arm or left, or pierced in flank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bold Sansonnetto and Astolpho near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had, with her, their limbs in harness dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though they for other end in arms appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing the maid and crowd engaged in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First lower the helmet’s vizor, next the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with their lances charge the mob outright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then bare their falchions, and, amid the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A passage with the trenchant weapons hew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The errant cavaliers who to that stage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To joust, from different lands had made resort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing them warfare with such fury wage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And into mourning changed the expected sport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because all knew not what had moved the rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the infuriate people in that sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor what the insult offered to the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspended stood in doubt and wondering.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of <em>these</em>, some will the crowded rabble’s band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Too late repentant of the feat) befriend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>Those</em>, favouring not the natives of the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than the foreigners, to part them wend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others more wary, with their reins in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sit watching how the mischief is to end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon and Aquilant are of the throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which hurry forward to avenge the wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The pair of warlike brethren witnessing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch’s drunken eyes with venom fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having heard from many in the ring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The occasion which the furious strife had wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself no whit less injured than the king</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Syria’s land, offended Gryphon thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each knight, in haste, supplied himself with spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thundering vengeance drove in full career.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On Rabican, pricked forth before his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Valiant Astolpho, from the other bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the enchanted lance of gold in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which at the first encounter bore to ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What knights he smote with it; and on the sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laid Gryphon first; next Aquilant he found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scarcely touched the border of his shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he reversed the warrior on the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From lofty saddle Sansonnet o’erthrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Famous for price and prowess, many a knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the outlet of the square the mob withdrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch raged with anger and despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, of the first cuirass and the new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Possest, as well as either helmet bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, when she all in flight discerned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conqueror towards her suburb-inn returned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sansonnet and Astolpho are not slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In following t’wards the gate the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The mob dividing all to let them go)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And halt when they have reached the barricade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon and Aquilant, who saw with woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Themselves on earth at one encounter laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their drooping heads, opprest with shame, decline,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor dare appear before King Norandine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seizing their steeds and mounting, either son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Oliver to seek their foemen went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many of his vassals too is gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king; on death or vengeance all intent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foolish rabble cry, “Lay on, lay on.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stand at distance and await the event.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon arrived where the three friends had gained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bridge, and facing round the post maintained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, at the first approach, Astolpho knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For still the same device had been his wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even from the day he charmed Orrilo slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His horse, his arms the same: him not with care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon had remarked, nor steadfast view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When late he jousted with him in the square:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knows him here and greets; next prays him show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who the companions are that with him go;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And why they had those arms, without the fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Syria’s king, pulled down, and to his slight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his champions England’s cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Gryphon courteously informed aright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But little of those arms, pursued the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knew, which were the occasion of the fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But (for he thither with Marphisa came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Sansonnet) had armed to aid the dame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While he and Gryphon stood in colloquy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aquilant came, and knew Astolpho good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he heard speaking with his brother nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though of evil purpose, changed his mood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Norandine’s trooped many, these to spy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But came not nigh the warriors where they stood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seeing them in conference, stood clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Listening, in silence, and intent to hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some one who hears Marphisa hold is there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Famed, through the world, for matchless bravery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His courser turns, and bids the king have care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save he would lose his Syrian chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To snatch his court, before all slaughtered are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the hand of Death and of Tisiphone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that ’twas verily Marphisa, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had borne away the arms in public view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Norandine is told that name of dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the Levant so feared on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose mention made the hair on many a head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bristle, though she was often distant wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fears the ill may happen which is said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless against the mischief he provide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence his meiny, who have changed their ire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already into fear, he bids retire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sons of Oliver, on the other hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Sansonnetto and the English knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So supplicate Marphisa, she her brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Puts up, and terminates the cruel fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the monarch next, amid his brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cries, proudly, “Sir, I know not by what right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou wouldst this armour, not thine own, present</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who conquers in thy tournament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Mine are these arms, which I, upon a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left on the road which leads from Armeny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, parforce afoot, I sought to stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A robber, who had sore offended me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The truth of this my ensign may display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which here is seen, if it be known to thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that she on the plate which sheathed the breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cleft in three places) showed a crown imprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To me this an Armenian merchant gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis true,” replied the king, “some days ago;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had you raised your voice, the arms to crave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You should have had them, whether yours or no.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, notwithstanding I to Gryphon gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The armour, I so well his nature know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He freely would resign the gift he earned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it by me to you might be returned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Your allegation needs not to persuade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These arms are yours⁠—that they your impress bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your word suffices me, by me more weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all that other witness could declare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grant them yours is but a tribute paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Virtue, worthy better prize to wear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now have the arms, and let us make accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let some fairer gift the knight reward.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gryphon, who little had those arms at heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But much to satisfy the king was bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Replied: “You recompense enough impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Teaching me how your wishes to content.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Here is my honour all at sake,” apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Me seemeth,” said Marphisa, and forewent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her claim for Gryphon’s sake, with courteous cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as his gift, in fine received the gear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the city, their rejoicings to renew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In love and peace they measured back their way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next came the joust, of which the honour due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prize was Sansonnet’s; since from the fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abstained Astolpho and the brethren two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-238" id="noteref-238" epub:type="noteref">238</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bold Marphisa, best of that array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like faithful friends and good companions; fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Sansonnet the tourney’s meed should gain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Eight days or ten in joy and triumph dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knights with Norandine; but with such strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desire of France the warriors’ bosoms swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which will not let them thence be absent long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They take their leave. Marphisa, who as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither would go, departs the troop among.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa had long time, with sword and lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desired to prove the paladins of France;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And make experiment, if they indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such worth as is by Rumour voiced display.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonnet leaves another, in his stead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The city of Jerusalem to sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now these five, in chosen squadron, speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who have few peers in prowess, on their way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dismist by Norandine, to Tripoli</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They wend, and to the neighbouring haven hie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there a carack find, about to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For western countries, taking in her store:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, with the patron, for themselves and gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And horses, make accord; a seaman hoar</span>
				<br/>

			<p>
				<span>The island of the amorous deity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breathed upon them an air, in her first port,</span>

				<span class="i1">But moulders iron; and here life is short;</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Inland six miles or seven from thence, a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scales, with an easy rise, a pleasant hill;</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thyme, marjoram, crocus, rose, and lily gay</span>

				<span class="i1">From odoriferous leaf such sweets distill,</span>

				<span class="i1">That they who sail the sea the fragrance bland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scent in each genial gale which blows from land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A fruitful rill, by limpid fountain fed,</span>

				<span class="i1">Waters, all round about, the fertile space.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The land of Venus truly may be said</span>

				<span class="i1">That passing joyous and delightful place:</span>

				<span class="i1">For every maid and wife, who there is bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is through the world beside, unmatched in grace:</span>

				<span>’Twas here they heard the same which they before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the orc and of Lucina, erst had heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Syria; how she to return once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Nicosià, to her lord prepared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence (a fair wind now blowing from the shore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bark for sea the ready Patron cleared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hawled up his anchor, westward turned the head</span>

				<span class="i1">Of the good ship, and all his canvas spread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the north wind, which blew upon their right,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When lo! a south-south-wester, which seemed light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the beginning, while the sun was high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards increased in force t’wards night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised up the sea against them mountains high;</span>

				<span class="i1">With such dread flashes, and loud peals of thunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Heaven, to swallow all in fire, would sunder.</span>

				<span>The clouds their gloomy veil above them strain,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above the welkin roared, beneath the main:</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, with sharp piercing cold and blinding rain,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sailors, in this war of wind and flood,</span>

			<p>
				<span>The cruel wind increased throughout the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which grew more dismal and more dark than hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wary Patron stood to sea outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he believed less broken was the swell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turned his prow to meet, with ready sleight,</span>

				<span class="i1">The buffets of the dreadful waves which fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never without some hope, that at day-break</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The storm might lull, or else its fury slake.</span>

			<p>
				<span>It lulls not, nor its fury slakes, but grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wilder, shows worse by day⁠—if this be day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which but by reckoning of the hours is known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not by any cheering light or ray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, with more fear (his weaker hope o’erthrown):</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sorrowing Patron to the wind gives way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He veers his barque before the cruel gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scowers the foaming sea with humble sail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Fortune on the sea annoys this crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She grants those others small repose by land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those left in France, who one another slew⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The men of England and the paynim band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These bold Rinaldo broke and overthrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor troops nor banners spread before him stand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of him, who his Bayardo fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had spurred the gallant Dardinel to meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The shield, of which Almontes’ son was vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That of the quarters, good Rinaldo spied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed him bold, and of a valiant strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with Orlando’s ensign dared to ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approaching nearer, this appeared more plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When heaps of slaughtered men he round him eyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Better it were,” he cried, “to overthrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This evil plant, before it shoot and grow.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each to retreat betook him, where the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His face directed, and large passage made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less the Saracens than faithful, clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The way, so reverenced is Fusberta’s blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save Dardinel, Mount Alban’s cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw none, nor he to chase his prey delayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom, “He cast upon thee mickle care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poor child, who of that buckler left thee heir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I seek thee out to prove (if thou attend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My coming) how thou keep’st the red and white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thou, save this from me thou canst defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Canst ill defend it from Orlando’s might.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the king: “Now clearly comprehend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I what I bear, as well defend in fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I more honour hope than trouble dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From my paternal quartering, white and red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Have thou no hope to make me fly, or yield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee my quarters, though a child I be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My life shalt thou take from me, if my shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I, in God, well hope the contrary.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—This as it may!⁠—shall none, in fighting field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say that I ever shamed my ancestry.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So said, and grasping in his hand the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youthful king assailed Mount Alban’s lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon all parts, a freezing fear goes through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart-blood of each trembling paynim nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they amazed the fierce Rinaldo view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who charged the monarch with such enmity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might a lion, which a bullock, new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stings of love, should in a meadow spy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moor smote first, but fruitless was his task,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who beat in vain upon Mambrino’s casque.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo smiled, and said; “I’d have thee know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I am better skilled to find the vein.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He spurs, and lets with that the bridle go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a thrust pushes with such might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A thrust against the bosom of his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That at his back the blade appears again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth issued blood and soul, and from his sell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifeless and cold the reeling body fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As languishes the flower of purple hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which levelled by the passing ploughshare lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or as the poppy, overcharged with dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In garden droops its head in piteous wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From life the leader of Zumara’s crew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-242" id="noteref-242" epub:type="noteref">242</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So past, his visage losing all its dyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So passed from life; and perished with their king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart and hope of all his following.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As waters will sometime their course delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stagnant, and penned in pool by human skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, when the opposing dyke is broke away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fall, and with mighty noise the country fill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas so the Africans, who had some stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Dardinello valour did instil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fled here and there, dismayed on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they him hurtling form his sell descried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Letting the flyers fly, of those who stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm in their place, Rinaldo breaks the array;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes kills on every hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who ranks well nigh Rinaldo on that day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These Leonetto’s, those Zerbino’s brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erturns, all rivals in the glorious fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well Charles and Oliver their parts have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turpin and Ogier, Guido and Salomon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In peril were the Moors, that none again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should visit Heatheness, that day opprest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the wise and wary king of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gathered, and from the field bore off the rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sit down with his loss he better gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed, that here to hazard purse and vest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better some remnant of the host to save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than bid whole squadrons stand and find a grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He bids forthwith the Moorish ensigns be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne to the camp, which fosse and rampart span,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the bold monarch of Andology,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant Portuguese, and Stordilan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sends to pray the king of Barbary,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-243" id="noteref-243" epub:type="noteref">243</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To endeavour to retire, as best be can;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will no little praise that day deserve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he his person and his place preserve.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That king, who deemed himself in desperate case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever more Biserta hoped to see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, with so horrible and foul a face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never Fortune had beheld, with glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard that Marsilius had contrived to place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Part of his host in full security;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And faced about his banners and bade beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout his broken squadrons a retreat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the best portion neither signal knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor listened to the drum or trumpet’s sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So scared, so crowded is the wretched crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That many in Seine’s neighbouring stream are drowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant, who would form the band anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(With him Sobrino) scowers the squadrons round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with them every leader good combines</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring the routed host within their lines.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But nought by sovereign or Sobrino done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, toiling, them with prayer or menace stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To march, where their ill-followed flags are gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can bring (I say not all) not even a third.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slaughtered or put to flight are two for one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who ’scapes⁠—nor he unharmed: among that herd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wounded is <em>this</em> behind, and <em>that</em> before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wearied, one and all, and harassed sore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And even within their lines, in panic sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They by the Christian bands are held in chase;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of all needful matters little store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was made there, for provisioning the place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charlemagne wisely by the lock before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would grapple Fortune, when she turned her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that dark night upon the field descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hushed all earthly matters and suspended:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By the Creator haply hastened, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was moved to pity for the works he made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The blood in torrents ran the country through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flooding the roads: while on the champaign laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were eighty thousand of the paynim crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cut off that day by the destroying blade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Last trooped from caverns, at the midnight-hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Villain and wolf to spoil them and devour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Charles returns no more within the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But camps without the city, opposite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moor’s cantonments, and bids up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And round, high-piled and frequent watch-fires light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim fashions ditch and bastion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rampart and mine, and all things requisite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Visits his outposts, and his guards alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor all the livelong night puts off his arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That livelong night the foes, throughout their tents,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As insecure and with their scathe deprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poured tears, and uttered murmurs and laments;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as they could, their sounds of woe supprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One grief for slaughtered friends or kindred vents;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some are by sorrows of their own distrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As wounded or as ill at ease; but more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tremble at mischief which they deem in store.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two Moors amid the paynim army were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From stock obscure in Ptolomita grown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom the story, an example rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of constant love, is worthy to be known:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro and Cloridan were named the pair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, whether Fortune pleased to smile or frown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Served Dardinello with fidelity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And late with him to France had crost the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of nimble frame and strong was Cloridane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout his life a follower of the chase.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cheek of white, suffused with crimson grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro had, in youth a pleasing grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor bound on that emprize, ’mid all the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was there a fairer or more jocund face.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-244" id="noteref-244" epub:type="noteref">244</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crisp hair he had of gold, and jet-black eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seemed an angel lighted from the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These two were posted on a rampart’s height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With more to guard the encampment from surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When ’mid the equal intervals, at night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro gazed on heaven with sleepy eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all his talk, the stripling, woful wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here cannot choose, but of his lord devise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The royal Dardinel; and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, left unhonoured on the field, deplore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then, turning to his mate, cries; “Cloridane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I cannot tell thee what a cause of woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is to me, my lord upon the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should lie, unworthy food for wolf or crow!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking how still to me he was humane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseems, if in his honour I forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This life of mine, for favours so immense</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall but make a feeble recompense.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That he may lack not sepulture, will I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Go forth, and seek him out among the slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply God may will that none shall spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Charles’s camp lies hushed. Do thou remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if my death be written in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou may’st the deed be able to explain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that if Fortune foil so fear a feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The world, through Fame, my loving heart may weet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amazed was Cloridan a child should show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such heart, such love, and such fair loyalty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fain would make the youth his though forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he held passing dear; but fruitlessly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would move his steadfast purpose; for such woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will neither comforted nor altered be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro is disposed to meet his doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or to enclose his master in the tomb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeing that nought would bend him, nought would move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I too will go,” was Cloridan’s reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“In such a glorious act myself will prove;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well such famous death I cover, I:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What other thing is left me, here above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deprived of thee, Medoro mine? To die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thee in arms is better, on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than afterwards of grief, should’st thou be slain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus resolved, disposing in their place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their guard’s relief, depart the youthful pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leave fosse and palisade, and, in small space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are among ours, who watch with little care:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, for they little fear the paynim race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slumber with fires extinguished everywhere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid carriages and arms, they lie supine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up to the eyes, immersed in sleep and wine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A moment Cloridano stopt and cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Not to be lost are opportunities.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This troop, by whom my master’s blood was shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro, ought not I to sacrifice?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do thou, lest any one this way be led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Watch everywhere about, with ears and eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For a wide way, amid the hostile horde,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I offer here to make thee with my sword.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said he, and his talk cut quickly short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Coming where learned Alpheus slumbered nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had the year before sought Charles’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In medicine, magic, and astrology</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well versed; but now in art found small support,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or rather found that it was all a lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had foreseen, that he his long-drawn life</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should finish in the bosom of his wife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now the Saracen with wary view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has pierced his weasand with the pointed sword.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Four others he neat that Diviner, slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor gave the wretches time to say a word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Turpin in his story tells not who,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Time had of their names effaced record.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Palidon of Moncalier next he speeds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One who securely sleeps between two steeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next came the warrior where, with limbs outspread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pillowed on barrel, lay the wretched Gryll:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This he had drained, and undisturbed by dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoped to enjoy a peaceful sleep and still.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The daring Saracen lopt off his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blood issues from the tap-hole, with a rill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wine; and he, well drenched with many a can,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dreams that he drinks, dispatched by Cloridan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next Gryll, Andropono and Conrad hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Greek and German, at two thrusts he gored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in the air had past large part of night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With dice and goblet; blest it at that board</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They still had watched, till, clothed in amber light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The radiant sun had traversed Indus’ ford!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But mortals Destiny would set at nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If every wight futurity were taught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As, in full fold, a lion long unfed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom wasting famine had made lean and spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Devours and rends, and swallows, and lays dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The feeble flock, which at his mercy are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, in their sleep, the cruel paynim bled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our host, and made wide slaughter everywhere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor blunted was the young Medoro’s sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he disdained to smite the ignoble horde.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He to Labretto’s duke, leaving those dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had come, who slumbered with a gentle mate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each clasping each so closely in their bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That air between them could not penetrate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From both Medoro cleanly lopt the head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! blessed way of death! oh! happy fate!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’tis my trust, that as their bodies, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their souls embracing to their bourne shall go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Malindo, with Andalico, he slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His brother, sons to the earl of Flanders they:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom has bearings (each to arms was new)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles had the lilies given; because that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch had beheld the valiant two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With crimsoned staves, returning from the fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And them with lands in Flanders vowed to glad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would, but that Medoro this forbad.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rearing the insidious blade, the pair are near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The place, where round King Charles’ pavilion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are tented warlike paladin and peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guarding the side that each is camped upon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in good time the paynims backward steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sheathe their swords, the impious slaughter done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming impossible, in such a number,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But they must light on one who does not slumber.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And though they might escape well charged with prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save themselves they think sufficient gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither by what he deems the safest way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Medoro following him) went Cloridane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, in the field, ’mid bow and falchion, lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shield and spear, in pool of purple stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wealthy and poor, the king and vassal’s corse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And overthrown the rider and his horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The horrid mixture of the bodies there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which heaped the plain where roved these comrades sworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might well have rendered vain their faithful care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the mighty piles, till break of morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not the moon, at young Medoro’s prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of a gloomy cloud put forth her horn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro to the heavens upturns his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the moon, and thus devoutly cries:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O holy goddess! whom our fathers well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have styled as of a triple form, and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy sovereign beauty dost in heaven, and hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And earth, in many forms reveal; and through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greenwood holt, of beast and monster fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A huntress bold⁠—the flying steps pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Show where my king, amid so many lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who did, alive, thy holy studies prize.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the youth’s prayer from parted cloud outshone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Were it the work of faith or accident)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The moon, as fair, as when Endymion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She circled in her naked arms: with tent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Christian or Saracen, was Paris-town</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seen in that gleam, and hill and plain’s extent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these Mount Martyr and Mount Levy’s height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This on the left, and that upon the right.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-245" id="noteref-245" epub:type="noteref">245</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The silvery splendour glistened yet more clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There where renowned Almontes’ son lay dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faithful Medoro mourned his master dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who well agnized the quartering white and red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With visage bathed in many a bitter tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For he a rill from either eyelid shed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And piteous act and moan, that might have whist</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winds, his melancholy plaint to list;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But with a voice supprest: not that he aught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Regards if any one the noise should hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he of his life takes any thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of which loathed burden he would fain be clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, lest his being heard should bring to nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pious purpose which has brought them here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youths the king upon their shoulders stowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so between themselves divide the load.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hurrying their steps, they hastened, as they might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under the cherished burden they conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now approaching was the lord of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sweep from heaven the stars, from earth the shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When good Zerbino, he, whose valiant sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ne’er in time of need by sleep downweighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From chasing Moors all night, his homeward way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was taking to the camp at dawn of day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He has with him some horsemen in his train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from afar the two companions spy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Expecting thus some spoil or prize to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, every one, towards that quarter hie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Brother, behoves us,” cried young Cloridane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To cast away the load we bear, and fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’twere a foolish thought (might well be said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lose <em>two</em> living men, to save <em>one</em> dead;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And dropt the burden, weening his Medore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had done the same by it, upon his side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that poor boy, who loved his master more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shoulders to the weight, alone, applied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cloridan hurrying with all haste before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming him close behind him or beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, did he know his danger, him to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand deaths, instead of one, would brave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those horsemen, with intent to make the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yield themselves prisoners to their band, or die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some here, some there, disperse the champaign through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every pass and outlet occupy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The captain, little distant from his crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is keener than the rest the chase to ply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when he sees them hurrying in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is certain that the twain are enemies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of old an ancient forest clothed that lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of trees and underwood a tangled maze;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of salvage beasts alone the wild repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like a labyrinth, full of narrow ways:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here from the boughs such shelter hope the pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As may conceal them well from hostile gaze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him I shall expect who loves the rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To listen to my tale some other time.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Medoro, by Angelica’s quaint hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is healed, and weds, and bears her to Catày.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At length Marphisa, with the chosen band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After long suffering, makes Laiazzi’s bay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Guido the savage, bondsman in the land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which impious women rule with civil sway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Marphisa strives in single fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lodges her and hers at full of night.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>By whom he is beloved can no one know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on the top of Fortune’s wheel is seated;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he, by true and faithless friends, with show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of equal faith, in glad estate is greeted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, should felicity be changed to woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flattering multitude is turned and fleeted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he who loves his master from his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even after death performs his faithful part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Were the heart seen as is the outward cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who at court is held in sovereign grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he that to his lord is little dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With parts reversed, would fill each other’s place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The humble man the greater would appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, now first, be hindmost in the race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But be Medoro’s faithful story said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth who loved his lord, alive or dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The closest path, amid the forest gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save himself, pursued the youth forlorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all his schemes were marred by the delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that sore weight upon his shoulders borne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The place he knew not, and mistook the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hid himself again in sheltering thorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure and distant was his mate, that through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greenwood-shade with lighter shoulders flew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So far was Cloridan advanced before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He heard the boy no longer in the wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when he marked the absence of Medore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed as if his heart was left behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Ah! how was I so negligent,” (the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed,) “so far beside myself, and blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I, Medoro, should without thee fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor know when I deserted thee or where?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, in the wood he disappears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunging into the maze with hurried pace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither, whence he lately issued, steers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, desperate, of death returns in trace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cries and the tread of steeds this while he hears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And word and the tread of foemen, as in chase;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lastly Medoro by his voice is known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disarmed, on foot, ’mid many horse, alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A hundred horsemen who the youth surround,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino leads, and bids his followers seize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling; like a top, the boy turns round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And keeps him as he can: among the trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind oak, elm, beech, ash, he takes his ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from the cherished load his shoulders frees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wearied, at length, the burden he bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the grass, and stalked about his load.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in her rocky cavern the she-bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom close warfare Alpine hunters wage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uncertain hangs about her shaggy care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And growls in mingled sound of love and rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To unsheath her claws, and blood her tushes bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would natural hate and wrath the beast engage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love softens her, and bids from strife retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for her offspring watch, amid her ire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cloridan who to aid him knows not how,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with Medoro willingly would die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But who would not for death this being forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until more foes than one should lifeless lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ambushed, his sharpest arrow to his bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fits, and directs it with so true an eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The feathered weapon bores a Scotchman’s brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lays the warrior dead upon the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Together, all the others of the band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned thither, whence was shot the murderous reed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile he launched another from his stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That a new foe might by the weapon bleed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom (while he made of <em>this</em> and <em>that</em> demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loudly questioned who had done the deed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The arrow reached⁠—transfixed the wretch’s throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cut his question short in middle note.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino, captain of those horse, no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can at the piteous sight his wrath refrain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In furious heat, he springs upon Medore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaiming, “Thou of this shalt bear the pain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One hand he in his locks of golden ore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enwreaths, and drags him to himself amain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as his eyes that beauteous face survey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes pity on the boy, and does not slay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him the stripling turns, with suppliant cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, “By thy God, sir knight,” exclaims, “I pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be not so passing cruel, nor deny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I in earth my honoured king may lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other grace I supplicate, nor I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This for the love of life, believe me, say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much, no longer, space of life I crave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As may suffice to give my lord a grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if you needs must feed the beast and bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like Theban Creon, let their worst be done<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-246" id="noteref-246" epub:type="noteref">246</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon these limbs; so that by me interred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In earth be those of good Almontes’ son.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro thus his suit, with grace, preferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And words⁠—to move a mountain; and so won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon Zerbino’s mood, to kindness turned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With love and pity he all over burned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while, a churlish horseman of the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who little deference for his lord confest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lance uplifting, wounded overhand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unhappy suppliant in his dainty breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, who the cruel action scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was deeply stirred, the rather that, opprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And livid with the blow the churl had sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Medoro fell as he was wholly dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So grieved Zerbino, with such wrath was stung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Not unavenged shalt thou remain,” he cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then full of evil will in fury sprung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the author of the foul emprize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he his vantage marks, and, from among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warriors, in a moment slips and flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cloridan, who beholds the deed, at sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of young Medoro’s fall, springs forth to fight;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And casts away his bow, and, ’mid the band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of foemen, whirls his falchion, in desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather of death, than hoping that his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May snatch a vengeance equal to his ire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid so many blades, he views the sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tinged with his blood, and ready to expire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And feeling he the sword no more can guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lets himself drop by his Medoro’s side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Scots pursue their chief, who pricks before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the deep wood, inspired by high disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he has left the one and the other Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> dead, <em>that</em> scarce alive, upon the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There for a mighty space lay young Medore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spouting his life-blood from so large a vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would have perished, but that thither made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stranger, as it chanced, who lent him aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By chance arrived a damsel at the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was (though mean and rustic was her wear)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of royal presence and of beauteous face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lofty manners, sagely debonair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her have I left unsung so long a space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you will hardly recognise the fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, in her (if known not) scan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lofty daughter of Catày’s great khan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Angelica, when she had won again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ring Brunello had from her conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So waxed in stubborn pride and haught disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seemed to scorn this ample world, and strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone, and held as cheap each living swain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although, amid the best, by Fame arrayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor brooked she to remember a galant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Count Orlando or king Sacripant;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And above every other deed repented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That good Rinaldo she had loved of yore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that to look so low she had consented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As by such choice dishonoured) grieved her sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love, hearing this, such arrogance resented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would the damsel’s pride endure no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where young Medoro lay he took his stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And waited her, with bow and shaft in hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When fair Angelica the stripling spies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh hurt to death in that disastrous fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for his king, that there unsheltered lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More sad than for his own misfortune lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She feels new pity in her bosom rise,</span>
				<br/>

			<p>
				<span>And calling back to memory her art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she in Ind had learned chirurgery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Since it appears such studies in that part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy of praise and fame are held to be,</span>

				<span class="i1">Till she in him should healthier life produce;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And recollects a herb had caught her sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In passing hither, on a pleasant plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What (whether dittany or pancy hight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not; fraught with virtue to restrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crimson blood forth-welling, and of might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sheathe each perilous and piercing pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She found it near, and having pulled the weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned to seek Medoro on the mead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Returning, she upon a swain did light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was on horseback passing through the wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strayed from the lowing herd, the rustic wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A heifer, missing for two days, pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him she with her conducted, where the might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the faint youth was ebbing with his blood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had the ground about so deeply dyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Life was nigh wasted with the gushing tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Angelica alights upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he her rustic comrade, at her hest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She hastened ’twixt two stones the herb to pound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then took it, and the healing juice exprest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this did she foment the stripling’s wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, even to the hips, his waist and breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (with such virtue was the salve endued)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It stanched his life-blood, and his strength renewed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And into him infused such force again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he could mount the horse the swain conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But good Medoro would not leave the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he in earth had seen his master laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, with the monarch, buried Cloridane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after followed whither pleased the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was to stay with him, by pity led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the courteous shepherd’s humble shed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor would the damsel quit the lowly pile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So she esteemed the youth) till he was sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such pity first she felt, when him erewhile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw outstretched and bleeding on the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touched by his mien and manners next, a file</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She felt corrode her heart with secret wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She felt corrode her heart, and with desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By little and by little warmed, took fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The shepherd dwelt, between two mountains hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In goodly cabin, in the greenwood-shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wife and children; in short time before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brent-new shed had builded in the glade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here of his griesly wound the youthful Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was briefly healed by the Catàyan maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But who in briefer space, a sorer smart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than young Medoro’s, suffered at her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A wound far wider and which deeper lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now in her heart she feels, from viewless bow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from the boy’s fair hair and beauteous eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had the winged archer dealt: a sudden glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She feels, and still the flames increasing rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet less she heeds her own than other’s woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Heeds not herself, and only to content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The author of her cruel ill is bent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her ill but festered and increased the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling’s wounds were seen to heal and close:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth grew lusty, while she suffered sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with new fever parched, now burnt, now froze:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From day to day in beauty waxed Medore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She miserably wasted; like the snow’s</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unseasonable flake, which melts away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exposed, in sunny place, to scorching ray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, if of vain desire will not die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must help herself, nor yet delay the aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she in truth, her will to satisfy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed ’twas no time to wait till she was prayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next of shame renouncing every tie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With tongue as bold as eyes, petition made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And begged him, haply an unwitting foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sheathe the suffering of that cruel blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O Count Orlando, O king of Circassy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say what your valour has availed to you!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say what your honour boots, what goodly fee</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sirs, show me but a single courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which she ever graced ye⁠—old or new⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As some poor recompense, desert, or guerdon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For having born so long so sore a burden!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! couldst thou yet again to life return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How hard would this appear, O Agricane!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-248" id="noteref-248" epub:type="noteref">248</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that she whilom thee was wont to spurn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sharp repulse and insolent disdain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O Ferraù, O ye thousand more, forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unsung, who wrought a thousand feats in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this ungrateful fair, what pain ’twould be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could you within his arms the damsel see!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To pluck, as yet untouched, the virgin rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica permits the young Medore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was none so blest as in that garden’s close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet to have set his venturous foot before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They holy ceremonies interpose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Somedeal to veil⁠—to gild⁠—the matter o’er.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young Love was bridesman there the tie to bless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for brideswoman stood the shepherdess.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the low shed, with all solemnities,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The couple made their wedding as they might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there above a month, in tranquil guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The happy lovers rested in delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save for the youth the lady has no eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor with his looks can satisfy her sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet of hanging on his neck can tire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of feel she can content her fond desire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beauteous boy is with her, night and day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does she untent herself, or keep the shed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Morning or eve they to some meadow stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to this bank, and to that other led:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply, in cavern harboured, at mid-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grateful as that to which Aeneas fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Dido, when the tempest raged above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faithful witness to their secret love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid such pleasures, where, with tree o’ergrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ran stream, or bubbling fountain’s wave did spin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On bark or rock, if yielding were the stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knife was straight at work or ready pin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, without, in thousand places lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in as many places graved, within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>Medoro</b> and <b>Angelica</b> were traced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In divers cyphers quaintly interlaced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she believed they had prolonged their stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than enow, the damsel made design</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In India to revisit her Catày,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with its crown Medoro’s head entwine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had upon her wrist an armlet, gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With costly gems, in witness and in sign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of love to her by Count Orlando borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which the damsel for long time had worn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On Ziliantes, hid beneath the wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This Morgue bestowed;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-249" id="noteref-249" epub:type="noteref">249</a> and from captivity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth (restored to Monodantes grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His ancient sire, through Roland’s chivalry)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Roland in return the bracelet gave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland, a lover, deigned the gorgeous fee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wear, with the intention to convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The present to his queen, of whom I say.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No love which to the paladin she bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that it costly is and wrought with care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This to Angelica so much endears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That never more esteemed was matter rare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This she was suffered, in <b>The Isle of Tears</b>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not by what privilege, to wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, naked, to the whale exposed for food</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that inhospitable race and rude.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, not possessing wherewithal to pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The kindly couple’s hospitality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Served by them in their cabin, from the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She there was lodged, with such fidelity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfastened from her arm the bracelet gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade them keep it for her memory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departing hence the lovers climb the side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hills, which fertile France from Spain divide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within Valencia or Barcelona’s town</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The couple thought a little to remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until some goodly ship should make her boun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To loose for the Levant: as so the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Journey, beneath Gerona⁠—coming down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those mountains⁠—they behold the subject main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And keeping on their left the beach below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By beaten track to Barcelona go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, ere they there arrive, a crazed wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They find, extended on the outer shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is bedaubed like swine, in filthy plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smeared with mud, face, reins, and bosom o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He comes upon them, as a dog in spite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swiftly assails the stranger at the door;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is about to do the lovers scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to the bold Marphisa I return⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, Astolpho, Gryphon, Aquilant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these and of the others will I tell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, death before their eyes, the vext Levant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Traverse, and ill resist the boisterous swell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While aye more passing proud and arrogant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waxes in rage and threat the tempest fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now three days the angry gale has blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor signal of abatement yet has shown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Waves lifted by the waxing tempest start</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Castle and flooring, and, if yet there be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aught standing left in any other part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis cut away and cast into the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, pricking out their course upon the chart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One by a lantern does his ministry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a sea-chest propt; another wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is busied in the well by torch’s light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This one beneath the poop, beneath the prow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other, stands to watch the ebbing sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (each half-glass run out) returns to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What way the ship has made, and towards what land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence all to speak their different thoughts, below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To midships make resort, with chart in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There where the mariners, assembled all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are met in council, at the master’s call.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One says: “Abreast of Limissò are we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the shoals”⁠—and by his reckoning, nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rocks of Tripoli and bark must be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where shipwrecked, for the most part, vessels lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another; “We are lost on Sataly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-250" id="noteref-250" epub:type="noteref">250</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose coast makes many patrons weep and sigh.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">According to their judgment, all suggest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their treasons, each with equal dread opprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>More spitefully the wind on the third day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blows, and the sea more yeasty billows rears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fore-mast by the first is borne away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rudder by the last, with him who steers.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better than steel that man will bide the assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Of marble breast⁠—who has not now his fears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, erst so confident ’mid harms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Denied not but that day she felt alarms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A pilgrimage is vowed to Sinai,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Cyprus and Gallicia, and to Rome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ettino, and other place of sanctity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If such is named, and to the holy tomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, above the sea and near the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bark is tost, with shattered plank and boom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From which the crew had cut, in her distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mizzenmast, to make her labour less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They bale and chest and all their heavy lumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast overboard, from poop, and prow, and side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every birth and cabin disencumber</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of merchandize, to feed the greedy tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Water to water others of the number</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rendered, by whom the spouting pumps were plied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This in the hold bestirs himself, where’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Planks opened by the beating sea appear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They in this trouble, in this woe, remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For full four days; and helpless was their plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a full victory the sea had gained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If yet a little had endured its spite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But them with hope of clearer sky sustained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wished appearance of <abbr>St.</abbr> Elmo’s light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which (every spar was gone) descending glowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a boat, which in the prow was stowed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-251" id="noteref-251" epub:type="noteref">251</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, flaming, they the beauteous light surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All those aboard kneeled down in humble guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Heaven for peace and for smooth water prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With trembling voices and with watery eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor longer waxed the storm, which had dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till then enduring in such cruel wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">North-wester or cross-wind no longer reigns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But tyrant of the sea the south remains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This on the sea remained so passing strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from its sable mouth so fiercely blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bore with it so swift a stream and strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the vext waters, that it hurried through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their tumbling waves the shattered bark along,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster than gentle falcon ever flew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sore the patron feared, to the world’s brink</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It would transport his bark, or wreck or sink.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For this the master finds a remedy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bids them cast out spars, and veer away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A line which holds this float, and as they flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, by two-thirds, their furious course delay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This counsel boots, and more the augury</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him whose lights upon the gunwale play.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-252" id="noteref-252" epub:type="noteref">252</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This saves the vessel, haply else undone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes her through the sea securely run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They, driven on Syria, in Laiazzo’s bay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mighty city rise; so nigh at hand,</span>

				<span class="i1">That they can from the vessel’s deck survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two castles, which the port within command.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pale turns the patron’s visage with dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he perceives what is the neighbouring land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will not to the port for shelter hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet can keep the open sea, nor fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They cannot fly, nor yet can keep the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For mast and yards are gone, and by the stroke</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the huge billows beating frequently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loosened is plank, and beam and timber broke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And certain death to make the port would be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or to be doomed to a perpetual yoke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For each is made a slave, or sentenced dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither by evil Chance or Error led.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sore dangerous ’twas to doubt; lest hostile band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should sally from the puissant town in sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With armed barks, and upon theirs lay hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In evil case for sea, and worse for fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the patron knows not what command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give, of him inquires the English knight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-253" id="noteref-253" epub:type="noteref">253</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What kept his mind suspended in that sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And why at first he had not made the port.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him relates the patron, “how a crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of murderous women tenanted that shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, by their ancient law, enslave or slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All those whom Fortune to this kingdom bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that <em>he</em> only could such for eschew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the lists ten champions overbore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having this achieved, the following night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In bed should with ten damsels take delight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if he brings to end the former feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But afterwards the next unfinished leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They kill him, and as slaves his following treat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned to delve their land or keep their beeves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—If for the first and second labour meet⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He liberty for all his band achieves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not for himself; who there must stay and wed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ten wives by him selected for his bed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So strange a custom of the neighbouring strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a laugh Astolpho cannot hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet and Marphisa, near at hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next Aquilant, and he, his brother dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrive: to them the patron who from land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye keeps aloof, explains the cause of fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cries; “I liefer in the sea would choke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than here of servitude endure the yoke.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sailors by the patron’s rede abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the passengers affrighted sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that Marphisa took the other side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hers, who deemed that safer was the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than sea, which raging round them, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than a hundred thousand swords dismayed them more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them little this, or other place alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they have but power to wield their arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warriors are impatient all to land:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But boldest is of these the English peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowing how soon his horn will clear the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the scared foe its pealing sound shall hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To put into the neighbouring port this band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desires, and are at strife with those who fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they who are the strongest, in such sort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Compel the patron, that he makes the port.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already when their bark was first espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At sea, within the cruel city’s view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They had observed a galley, well supplied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With practised mariners and numerous crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(While them uncertain counsels did divide)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make for their wretched ship, the billows through:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her lofty prow to their short stern and low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These lash, and into port the vessel tow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They thitherward were worked with warp and oar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than with assistance of the sail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since to lay starboard course or larboard more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No means were left them by the cruel gale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again their rugged rhind the champions wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Girding the faithful falchion with the mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with unceasing hope of comfort fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Master and mariners opprest with dread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like a half-moon, projected from the beach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than four miles about, the city’s port;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six hundred paces deep; and crowning each</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Horn of the circling haven, was a fort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On every side, secure from storm or breach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Save only from the south), a safe resort.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In guise of theatre the town extended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About it, and a hill behind ascended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No sooner there the harboured ship was seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The news had spread already through the land)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than thitherward, with martial garb and mien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six thousand women trooped, with bow in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to remove all hope of flight, between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One castle and the other, drew a band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with strong chains and barks the port enclosed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ever, for that use, they kept disposed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A dame, as the Cumean sybil gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Hector’s ancient mother of renown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made call the patron out, and bade him say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If they their lives were willing to lay down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or were content beneath the yoke to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">According to the custom of the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—One of two evils they must choose⁠—be slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or captives, one and all, must there remain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Tis true, if one so bold and of such might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be found amid your crew,” (the matron said),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he ten men of ours engage in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And can in cruel battle lay them dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, after, with ten women, in one night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffice to play the husband’s part in bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shall remain our sovereign, and shall sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The land, and you may homeward wend your way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And at <em>your</em> choice to stay shall also be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether a part or all, but with this pact,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he who here would stay and would be free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can with ten dames the husband’s part enact.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if your chosen warrior fall or flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By his ten enemies at once attacked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or for the second function have not breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slavery you we doom, and him to death.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At what she deemed the cavaliers would start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beldam found them bold; for to compete</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With those they should engage, and play their part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The champions hoped alike in either feat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor failed renowned Marphisa’s valiant heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit for the second dance unmeet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure, where nature had her aid denied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The want should with the falchion be supplied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The patron is commanded their reply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved in common council to unfold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The dames at pleasure may their prowess try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shall in lists and bed allow them bold.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lashings from the vessels they untie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The skipper heaves the warp, and bids lay hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lowers the bridge; o’er which, in warlike weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The expectant cavaliers their coursers lead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These through the middle of the city go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And see the damsels, as they forward fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ride through the streets, succinct, in haughty show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And arm, in guise of warriors, in the square.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to gird sword, nor fasten spur below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is man allowed, nor any arm to wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excepting, as I said, the ten; to follow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ancient usage which those women hallow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All others of the manly sex they seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To ply the distaff, broider, card and sow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In female gown descending to the feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which renders them effeminate and slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some chained, another labour to complete,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are tasked, to keep their cattle, or to plough.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few are the males; and scarce the warriors ken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid a thousand dames, a hundred men.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The knights determining by lot to try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in their common cause on listed ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should slay the ten, with whom they were to vie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the other field ten others wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Designed to pass the bold Marphisa by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believing she unfitting would be found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would be, in the second joust at eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill-qualified the victory to achieve.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But with the others she, the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will run her risk; and ’tis her destiny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I will lay down this life,” the damsel said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Rather than you lay down your liberty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But <em>this</em>”⁠—with that she pointed to the blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which she had girt⁠—“is your security,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will all tangles in such manner loose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Alexander did the Gordian noose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will not henceforth stranger shall complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long as the world lasts, of this repair.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So said the maid, nor could the friendly train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Take from her what had fallen to her share.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then⁠—either every thing to lose, or gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their liberty⁠—to her they leave the care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With stubborn plate and mail all over steeled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ready for cruel fight, she takes the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High up the spacious city is place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With steps, which serve as seats in rising rows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which for nought else is used, except the chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tourney, or wrestling match, or suchlike shows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Four gates of solid bronze secure the space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither of armed dames the rabble flows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In troubled tide; and to Marphisa bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she may enter, afterwards is told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On pieballed horse Marphisa entered⁠—spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were circles dappling all about his hair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a bold countenance and little head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And beauteous points, and haughty gait and air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of a thousand coursers which he fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, as the best, and biggest, and most rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Norandino chose, and, decked with brave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And costly trappings, to Marphisa gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through the south gate, from the mid-day, the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa entered, nor expected long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before she heard approaching trumpet-strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Peal through the lists in shrilling notes and strong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, looking next towards the northern wain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw her ten opposites appear: among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, as their leader, pricked a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excelling all the rest in goodly cheer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On a large courser came the leading foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which was, excepting the near foot behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And forehead, darker than was ever crow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foot and forehead with some white were signed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horseman did his horse’s colours show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his own dress; and hence might be divined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, as the mournful hue o’erpowered the clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was less inclined to smile, than mournful tear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At once their spears in rest nine warriors laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the trump sounded, in the hostile train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he in black no sign of jousting made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if he held such vantage in disdain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better he deemed the law were disobeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that his courtesy should suffer stain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight retires apart, and sits to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What against nine one single lance can do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of smooth and balanced pace, the damsel’s horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the encounter her with swiftness bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who poised a lance so massive in the course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It would have been an overweight for four.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, disembarking, as of greatest force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The boom had chosen out of many more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At her fierce semblance when in motion, quail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand hearts, a thousand looks grow pale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The bosom of the first she opens so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might surprise, if naked were the breast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She pierced the cuirass and the mail below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first a buckler, solid and well prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A yard behind the shoulders of the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was seen the steel, so well was it addrest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speared on her lance she left him on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the others drove with flowing rein;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so she shocked the second of the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dealt the third so terrible a blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From sell and life, with broken spine, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She drove at once. So fell the overthrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with such weight she charged the warriors through!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So serried was the battle of the foe!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have seen bombard open in such mode</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The squadrons, as that band Marphisa strowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many good spears were broken on the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was as little moved as solid wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When revellers play the chase’s merry game,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-254" id="noteref-254" epub:type="noteref">254</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is ever moved by stroke of heavy ball.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hard the temper of her corslet’s mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The strokes aye harmless on the breast-plate fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose steel was heated in the fires of hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in Avernus’ water slaked by spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the end of the career, she checked her steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheeled him about, and for a little stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then against the others drove at speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broke them, and to the handle dyed her blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>Here</em> shorn of arms, and <em>there</em> of head, they bleed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other in such manner cleft the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That breast, and head, and arms together fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Belly and legs remaining in the sell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With such just measure him she cleaves, I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the two haunches and the ribs confine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaves him a half figure, in such way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As what we before images divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of silver, oftener made of wax, survey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which supplicants from far and near enshrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In thanks for mercy shown, and to bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pious quittance for accepted vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa next made after one that flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And overtook the wretch, and cleft (before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He the mid-square had won) his collar through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So clean, no surgeon ever pieced it more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One after other, all in fine she slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or wounded every one she smote so sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She was secure, that never more would foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arise anew from earth, to work her woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cavalier this while had stood aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had the ten conducted to the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, with so many against one to ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had seemed to him advantage four and base;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, now he by a single hand espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So speedily his whole array displaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pricked forth against the martial maid, to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas courtesy, not fear, had made him slow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, signing with his right hand, made appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he would speak ere their career was run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thinking that beneath such manly cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A gentle virgin was concealed, begun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I wot thou needs must be, sir cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore wearied with such mighty slaughter done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if I were disposed to weary thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than thou art, it were discourtesy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To thee, to rest until to-morrow’s light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to renew the battle, I concede.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No honour ’twere to-day to prove my might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On thee, whom weak and overwrought I read.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Arms are not new to me, nor listed fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor does fatigue so short a toil succeed,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Answered Marphisa, “and I, at my post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hope to prove this upon thee, to thy cost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I thank thee for thy offer of delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But need not what thy courtesy agrees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet remains so large a space of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere very shame to spend it all in ease.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Oh! were I (he replied) so sure to appay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart with everything which best would please,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As thine I shall appay in this!⁠—but see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ere thou thinkest, daylight fail not thee.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said he; and obedient to his hest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two spears, say rather heavy booms, they bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to Marphisa bids consigns the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the other takes himself: the martial pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already, with their lances in the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wait but till other blast the joust declare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! earth and air and sea the noise rebound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they prick forth, at the first trumpet’s sound!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No mouth was opened and no eyelid fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor breath was drawn, amid the observant crew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sore intent was every one to spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which should be conqueror of the warlike two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa the black champion from his sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So to o’erthrow he shall not rise anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Levels her lance; and the black champion, bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay Marphisa, spurs with like intent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Both lances, made of willow thin and dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than stout and stubborn oak, appeared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So splintered even to the rest, they fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with such force the encountering steeds careered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed, as with a scythe-blade equally</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hams of either courser had been sheared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike both fall; but voiding quick the seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The nimble riders start upon their feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa in her life, with certain wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand cavaliers on earth had laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And never had herself been borne to ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet quitted now the saddle, as was said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only at the accident astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But nigh beside herself, remained the maid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strange to the sable cavalier withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unwont to be unhorsed, appeared his fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They scarcely touch the ground before they gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their feet, and now the fierce assault renew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With cut and thrust; which now with shield the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or blade ward off, and now by leaps eschew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether the foes strike home, or smite in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blows ring, and echo parted aether through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More force those shields, those helms, those breast-plates show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than anvils underneath the sounding blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If heavy falls the savage damsel’s blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> falls not lightly of her warlike foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equal the measure one the other paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both receive as much as they bestow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who would see two daring spirits weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek two fiercer need no further go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to seek more dexterity or might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For greater could not be in mortal wight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The women who have sate long time, to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The champions with such horrid strokes offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sign of trouble in the warriors true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold, nor yet of weariness, commend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them with just praises, as the worthiest two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That are, where’er the sea’s wide arms extend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They deem these of mere toil and labour long</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must die, save they be strongest of the strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Communing with herself, Marphisa said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he moved not before was well for me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who risked to have been numbered with the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he at first had joined his company.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, as it is, I hardly can make head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against his deadly blows.” This colloquy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She with herself maintained, and while she spoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ceased not to ply her sword with circling stroke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Twas well for me,” the other cried again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That to repose I did not leave the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I now from him defend myself with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is o’erwearied with the former fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What had he been, renewed in might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he had rested till to-morrow’s light?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right fortunate was I, as man could be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he refused my proffered courtesy!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till eve they strove, nor did it yet appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had the vantage of the doubtful fray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, without light, could either foe see clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How to avoid the furious blows; when day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was done, again the courteous cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his illustrious opposite ’gan say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What shall we do, since ill-timed shades descend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While we with equal fortune thus contend?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Meseems, at least, that till to-morrow’s morn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere better thou prolonged thy life: no right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have I thy doom, sir warrior, to adjourn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the limits of one little night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will I that by me the blame be borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou no longer shalt enjoy the light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With reason to the sex’s charge, by whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This place is governed, lay thy cruel doom.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If I lament thee and thy company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>He</b> knows, by whom all hidden things are spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou and thy comrades may repose with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For whom there is no safe abode beside:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since leagued against you in conspiracy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are all those husbands by thy hand have died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For every valiant warrior of the men</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slain in the tourney, consort was of ten.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The scathe they have to-day received from thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would ninety women wreak with vengeful spite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, save thou take my hospitality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except by them to be assailed this night.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“I take thy proffer in security,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Replied Marphisa), “that the faith so plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goodness of thy heart, will prove no less,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than are thy corporal strength and hardiness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But if, as having to kill me, thou grieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou well mayst grieve, for reasons opposite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor hast thou cause to laugh, as I conceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor hitherto has found me worst in fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether thou wouldst defer the fray, or leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or prosecute by this or other light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold me prompt thy wishes to fulfil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where and whenever it shall be thy will!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So by consent the combatants divided,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the dawn broke from Ganges’ stream anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so remained the question undecided,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which was the better champion of the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To both the brothers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-255" id="noteref-255" epub:type="noteref">255</a> and the rest who sided</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that part, the liberal lord did sue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With courteous prayer, that till the coming day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They would be pleased beneath his roof to stay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They unsuspecting with the prayer complied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the cheerful blaze of torches white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A royal dome ascended, with their guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divided into many bowers and bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The combatants remain as stupified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On lifting up their vizors, at the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One of the other; for (by what appears)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior hardly numbers eighteen years.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much marvels with herself the gentle dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That one so young so well should do and dare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much marvels <em>he</em> (his wonderment the same)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he her sex agnizes by her hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Questioning one another of their name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As speedily reply the youthful pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But how was hight the youthful cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Await till the ensuing strain to hear.</span>

					<span epub:type="label">Canto</span>
					<span epub:type="ordinal z3998:roman">II</span>
				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>A hermit parts, by means of hollow sprite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The two redoubted rivals’ dangerous play;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rinaldo goes where Love and Hope invite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But is dispatched by Charles another way:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bradamant, seeking her devoted knight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The good Rogero, nigh becomes the prey</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Pinabel, who drops the damsel brave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the dungeon of a living grave.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Injurious Love, why still to mar accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between desires has been thy favourite feat?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why does it please thee so, perfidious lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two hearts should with a different measure beat?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou wilt not let me take the certain ford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragging me where the stream is deep and fleet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her I abandon who my love desires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While she who hates, respect and love inspires.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou to Rinaldo show’st the damsel fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he seems hideous to that gentle dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, who when the lady’s pride and care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Paid back with deepest hate her amorous flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now pines, himself, the victim of despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scorned in his turn, and his reward the same.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the changed damsel in such sort abhorred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would choose death before that hated lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He to the Pagan cries: “Forego thy theft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And down, false felon, from that pilfer’d steed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am not wont to let my own be reft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who seeks it dearly pays the deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More⁠—I shall take from thee yon lovely weft;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave thee such a prize were foul misdeed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And horse and maid, whose worth outstrips belief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were ill, methinks, relinquished to a thief.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou liest,” the haughty Saracen retorts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As proud, and burning with as fierce a flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“A thief thyself, if Fame the truth reports:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let good deeds decide our dubious claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom the steed or damsel fair assorts:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Best proved by valiant deeds: though, for the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That nothing is so precious, I with thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Search the wide world throughout) may well agree.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As two fierce dogs will somtimes stand at gaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom hate or other springs of strife inspire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grind their teeth, while each his foe surveys</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sidelong glance and eyes more red than fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then either falls to bites, and hoarsely bays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While their stiff bristles stand on end with ire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So from reproach and menace to the sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pass Sacripant and Clermont’s angry lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus kindling into wrath the knights engage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One is on foot, the other on his horse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small gain to this; for inexperienced page</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would better rein his charger in the course.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such Bayardo’s sense, he will not wage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">War with his master, or put out his force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For voice, nor hand, nor manage, will he stir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rebellious to the rein or goading spur.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, when the king would urge him, takes the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, when he curbs him, runs in giddy rings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drops his head beneath his spreading chest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plays his spine, and runs an-end and flings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now the furious Saracen distressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sees ’tis no time to tame the beast, and springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With one hand on the pummel, to the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clear of the restless courser at a bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as Sacripant, with well-timed leap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is from the fury of Bayardo freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You may believe the battle does not sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between those champions, matched in heart and deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their sounding blades such changeful measure keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hammer-strokes of Vulcan with less speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descend in that dim cavern, where he heats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Jove’s red thunders on his anvil beats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sometimes they lunge, then feign the thrust and parry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deep masters of the desperate game they play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or rise upon the furious stroke, and carry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their swords aloft, or stoop and stand at bay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again they close, again exhausted tarry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now hide, now show themselves, and now give way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where one knight an inch of ground has granted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foeman’s foot upon that inch is planted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, lo! Rinaldo, now impatient grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strikes full at Sacripant with lifted blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he puts forth his buckler made of bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well with strong and stubborn steel inlaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though passing thick, Fusberta<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a> cleaves it: groan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greenwood, and covert close, and sunny glade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim’s arm rings senseless with the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And steel and bone, like ice, in shivers go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the fair damsel saw, with timid eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such ruin follow from the faulchion’s sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, like the criminal, whose doom is nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changed her fair countenance through sore dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed that little time was left to fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she would not be that Rinaldo’s prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo loathed by her as much, as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doats on the scornful damsel miserably.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So turned her horse into the gloomy chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drove him through rough path and tangled ally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oftentimes bent back her bloodless face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw Rinaldo from each thicket sally.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor flying long had urged the frantic race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before she met a hermit in a valley.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Devotion in his aspect was expressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his long beard descended on his breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wasted he was as much by fasts as age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on an ass was mounted, slow and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His visage warranted that never sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had conscience more precise or passing pure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though in his arteries time had stilled the rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of blood, and spake him feeble and demure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At sight of the delighted damsel, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was inly stirred for very charity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lady prayed that kindly friar, that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would straight conduct her to some haven near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that she from the land of France might flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And never more of loathed Rinaldo hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hermit, who was skilled in sorcery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ceased not to soothe the gentle damsel’s fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the promise of deliverance, shook</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His pocket, and drew forth a secret book.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This opened, quick and mighty marvel wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For not a leaf is finished by the sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before a spirit, by his bidding brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waits his command in likeness of a page:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, by the magic writ constrained and taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hastes where the warriors face to face engage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the cool shade⁠—but not in cool disport⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And steps between, and stops their battle short.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In courtesy,” he cried, “let either show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What his foe’s death to either can avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what the guerdon conquest will bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him who in the battle shall prevail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Roland, though he has not struck a blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or snapt in fight a single link of mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Paris-town conveys the damsel gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has engaged you in this bitter fray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Within an easy mile I saw the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pricking to Paris with that lady bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Riding, in merry mood, with laugh and jeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mocking at your fierce and fruitless fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sure it were better, while they yet are near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow peer and damsel in their flight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For should he once in Paris place his prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady never more shall meet your eyes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>You might have seen those angry cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Change at the demon’s tale for rage and shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And curse themselves as wanting eyes and ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To let their rival cheat them of the dame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards his horse the good Rinaldo steers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breathing forth piteous sighs which seem of flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if he joins Orlando⁠—ere they part⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swears in his fury he will have his heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, passing where the prompt Bayardo stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaps on his back, and leaves, as swift as wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without farewell, his rival in the wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much less invites him to a seat behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goaded charger, in his heat of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forces whate’er his eager course confined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ditch, river, tangled thorn, or marble block;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He swims the river, and he clears the rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let it not, sir, sound strangely in your ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo took the steed thus readily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long and vainly followed far and near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he, endued with reasoning faculty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not in vice lured on the following peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fled before his cherished lord, that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might guide him whither went the gentle dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For whom, as he had heard, he nursed a flame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For when Angelica, in random dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the pavilion winged her rapid flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bayardo marked the damsel as she fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His saddle lightened of Mount Alban’s knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who then on foot an equal combat sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Matched with a baron of no meaner might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chased the maid by woods, and floods, and strands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In hopes to place her in the warrior’s hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, with desire to bring him to the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gallopped before him still with rampant play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would not let his master mount, afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might make him take another way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So luring on Rinaldo through the shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twice brought him to his unexpected prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twice foiled in his endeavour: once by bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù; then Sacripant, as lately told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now good Bayardo had believed the tiding</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that fair damsel, which produced the accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the devil’s cunning tale confiding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renewed his wonted service to his lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold Rinaldo then in fury riding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pushing still his courser Paris-ward!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though he fly fast, the champion’s wishes go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster; and wind itself had seemed too slow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At night Rinaldo rests his steed, with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To meet Anglante’s lord he burned so sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lent such credit to the tidings vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the false courier of that wizard hoar:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that day and the next, with flowing rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rode, till the royal city rose before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His eyes; where Charlemagne had taken post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the sad remnant of his broken host.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, for he fears the Afric king’s pursuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sap and siege, upon his vassals calls</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To gather in fresh victual, and recruit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleanse their ditches, and repair their walls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what may best annoy the foes, and suit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For safety, without more delay forestalls;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plans an embassy to England, thence</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To gather fresher forces for defence.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he is bent again to try the fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of arms in tented field, though lately shamed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And send Rinaldo to the neighbouring state</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Britain, which was after England named.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill liked the Paladin to cross the strait;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that the people or the land he blamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that King Charles was sudden; nor a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would grant the valiant envoy for delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo never executed thing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less willingly, prevented in his quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that fair visage he was following,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose charms his heart had ravished from his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, in obediance to the christian king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepared himself to do the royal hest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Calais the good envoy wends with speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the same day embarks himself and steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there, in scorn of cautious pilot’s skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such his impatience to regain his home),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Launched on the doubtful sea, which boded ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rolled its heavy billows, white with foam.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wind, enraged that he opposed his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stirred up the waves; and, ’mid the gathering gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the loud storm and tempest’s fury grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That topmast-high the flashing waters flew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The watchful mariners, in wary sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haul down the mainsail, and attempt to wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would put back in panic to the port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence, in ill hour, they loosed with little care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Not so,” exclaims the wind, and stops them short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“So poor a penance will not pay the dare.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when they fain would veer, with fiercer roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pelts back their reeling prow and blusters more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Starboard and larboard bears the fitful gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And never for a thought its ire assuages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the strained vessel drives with humble sail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the billows, as the tempest rages.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I, who still pursue a varying tale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must leave awhile the Paladin, who wages</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A weary warfare with the wind and flood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow a fair virgin of his blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I speak of that famed damsel, by whose spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erthrown, King Sacripant on earth was flung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The worthy sister of the valiant peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Beatrix and good Duke Aymon sprung.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By daring deeds and puissance no less dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Charlemagne and France: Since proved among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first, her prowess, tried by many a test,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equal to good Rinaldo’s shone confessed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A cavalier was suitor to the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who out of Afric passed with Agramant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero was his valiant father’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His mother was the child of Agolant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, who not of bear or lion came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disdained not on the Child her love to plant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though cruel Fortune, ill their wishes meeting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had granted to the pair a single greeting.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alone thenceforth she sought her lover (he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was named of him to whom he owed his birth),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And roved as safe as if in company</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of thousands, trusting in her single worth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She having made the king of Circassy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Salute the visage of old mother earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Traversed a wood, and that wood past, a mountain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stopt at length beside a lovely fountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through a delicious mead the fountain-rill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By ancient trees o’ershaded, glides away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him whose ear its pleasing murmurs fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Invites to drink, and on its banks to stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the left side a cultivated hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excludes the fervors of the middle day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As first the damsel thither turns her eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A youthful cavalier she seated spies;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A cavalier, who underneath the shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seems lost, as in a melancholy dream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the bank, which gaudy flowers displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reposing, overhangs the crystal stream.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His horse beneath a spreading beech is laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from a bough the shield and helmet gleam.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While his moist eyes, and sad and downcast air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speak him the broken victim of despair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Urged by the passion lodged in every breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A restless curiosity to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of others’ cares, the gentle maid addressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight, and sought the occasion of his woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he to her his secret grief confessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Won by her gentle speech and courteous show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by that gallant bearing, which at sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepared who saw her for nimble knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fair sir, a band of horse and foot,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I brought to Charlemagne; and thither pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he an ambush for Marsilius spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descending from the Pyrenean crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in my company a damsel led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose charms with fervid love had fired my breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, as we journey by Rhone’s current, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A rider on a winged courser spy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The robber, whether he were man or shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or goblin damned to everlasting woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as he beheld my dear-loved maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like falcon, who, descending, aims its blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sank in a thought and rose; and soaring, laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hands on his prize, and snatched her from below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So quick the rape, that all appeared a dream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until I heard in air the damsel’s scream.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The ravening kite so swoops and plunders, when</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hovering above the shelterd yard, she spies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A helpless chicken near unwatchful hen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who vainly dins the thief with after cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I cannot reach the mountain-robber’s den,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Compassed with cliffs, or follow one who flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides, way-foundered is my weary steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who ’mid these rocks has wasted wind and speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But I, like one who from his bleeding side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would liefer far have seen his heart out-torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left my good squadrons masterless, to ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the cliffs, and passes least forlorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And took the way (love served me for a guide)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where it appeared the ruthless thief had born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ascending to his den, the lovely prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time he snatched my hope and peace away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Six days I rode, from morn to setting sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By horrid cliff, by bottom dark and drear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And giddy precipice, where path was none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sign, nor vestiges of man were near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last a dark and barren vale I won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where caverned mountains and rude cliffs appear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where in the middle rose a rugged block,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a fair castle planted on the rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“From far it shone like flame, and seemed not dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of marble or of brick; and in my eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More wonderful the work, more fair to sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The walls appeared, as I approached more nigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, after, learned that it was built by sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom potent fumes had raised and sorcery:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on this rock its towers of steel did fix,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Case-hardened in the stream and fire of Styx.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Each polished turret shines with such a ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it defies the mouldering rust and rain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The robber scours the country night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after harbours in this sure domain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing is safe which he would bear away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued with curses and with threats in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There (fruitless every hope to foil his art)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The felon keeps my love, oh! say my heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas! what more is left me but to eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her prison on that cliff’s aerial crest?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like the she-fox, who hears her offspring cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Standing beneath the ravening eagle’s nest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And since she has not wings to rise and fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Runs round the rugged rock with hopeless quest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So inaccessible the wild dominion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whatsoever has not plume and pinion.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“While I so lingered where those rocks aspire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw a dwarf guide two of goodly strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose coming added hope to my desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Alas! desire and hope alike were vain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both barons bold, and fearful in their ire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The one Gradasso, King of Sericane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The next, of youthful vigour, was a knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prized in the Moorish court, Rogero hight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The dwarf exclaimed, ‘These champions will assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their force with him who dwells on yonder steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by such strange and unattempted way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spurs the winged courser from his mountain-keep.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I to the approaching warriors say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Pity, fair sirs, the cruel loss I weep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as I trust, yon daring spoiler slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give my lost lady to my arms again.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then how my love was ravished I make known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vouching with bitter tears my deep distress.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They proffer aid, and down the path of stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which winds about the craggy mountain, press.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While I, upon the summit left alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Look on, and pray to God for their success.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the wily wizard’s castle strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extends a little plain, two bowshots long.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Arrived beneath the craggy keep, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Contend which warrior shall begin the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, whether the first lot Gradasso drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or young Rogero held the honor light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The King of Sericane his bugle blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the rock rang and fortress on the height;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, lo! apparelled for the fearful course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier upon his winged horse!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Upwards, by little and by little, springs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winged courser, as the pilgrim crane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds not at first his balance and his wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Running and scarcely rising from the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the flock is launched and scattered, flings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His pinions to the wind, and soars amain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So straight the necromancer’s upward flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The eagle scarce attempts so bold a height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When it seems fit, he wheels his courser round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who shuts his wings, and falling from the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shoots like a well trained falcon to the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sees the quarry, duck or pigeon, fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, through the parting air, with whizzing sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rested lance, he darted from on high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And while Gradasso scarcely marks the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hears him swooping near, and feels the blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The wizard on Gradasso breaks his spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wounds the empty air, with fury vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This in the feathered monster breeds no fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to a distance shifts, and swoops again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While that encounter made the Alfana rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrown back upon her haunches, on the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Alfana that the Indian monarch rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fairest was that ever man bestrode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Up to the starry sphere with swift ascent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wizard soars, then pounces from the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strikes the young Rogero, who, intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon Gradasso, deems no danger nigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the wizard’s blow the warrior bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which made some deal his generous courser ply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when to smite the shifting foe he turned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him in the sky, and out of reach discerned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His blows Rogero, now Gradasso, bruise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On forehead, bosom, back, or flanks, between;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he the warrior’s empty blows eschews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shifting so quickly that he scarce is seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now this, now that, the wizard seems to choose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monster makes such spacious rings and clean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the enchanter so deceives the knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They view him not, and know not whence he smites.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Between the two on earth and him o’ the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until that hour the warfare lasted there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, spreading wide its veil of dusky dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout the world, discolours all things fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What I beheld, I say; I add not, I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A tittle to the tale; yet scarcely dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell to other what I stood and saw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So strange it seems, so passing Nature’s law.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Well covered in a goodly silken case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, the celestial warrior, bore his shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But why delayed the mantle to displace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not, and its lucid orb concealed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since this no sooner blazes in his face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than his foe tumbles dazzled on the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And while he, like a lifeless body, lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Becomes the necromancer’s helpless prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Like carbuncle, the magic buckler blazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No glare was ever seen which shone so bright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could the warriors choose but fall, amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And blinded by the clear and dazzling light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, too, that from a distant mountain gazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell senseless; and when I regained my sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After long time, saw neither knights nor page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor aught beside a dark and empty stage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This while the fell enchanter, I supposed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragged both the warriors to his prison-cell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by strange virtue of the shield disclosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I from my hope and they from freedom fell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus I to the turrets, which enclosed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart, departing, bade a last farewell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now sum my griefs, and say if love combine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other distress or grief to match with mine.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The knight relapsed into his first disease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After his melancholy tale was done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was Count Pinabel, the Maganzese,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anselmo d’Altaripa’s faithless son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, where the blood ran foul through all degrees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disdained to be the only virtuous one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor played a simple part among the base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passing in vice the villains of his race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With aspect changing still, the beauteous dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hears what the mournful Maganzese narrates;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at first mention of Rogero’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her radiant face with eager joy dilates.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, full of pity, kindles into flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Pinabel his cruel durance states.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor finds she, though twice told, the story stale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But makes him oft repeat and piece his tale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, after, when she deemed that all was clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cried to the knight, “Repose upon my say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee may my arrival well be dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou as fortunate account this day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Straight wend me to the keep, sir cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which holds a jewel of so rich a ray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor shalt thou grudge thy labour and thy care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If envious Fortune do but play me fair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The knight replied, “Then nought to me remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that I yonder mountain-passes show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sure ’tis little loss to lose my pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where every thing is lost I prize below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But you would climb yon cliffs, and for your gains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will find a prison-house, and be it so!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whate’er betide you, blame yourself alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You go forewarned to meet a fate foreshown.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said, the cavalier remounts his horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And serves the gallant damsel as a guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is prepared Rogero’s gaol to force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or to be slain, or in his prison stied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When lo! a messenger, in furious course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Called to the dame to stay, and rode and cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was the post who told Circassia’s lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What valiant hand had stretched him on the sward.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The courier, who so plied his restless heel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">News of Narbonne and of Montpelier bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How both had raised the standard of Castile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All Acquamorta siding with the Moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how Marseilles’ disheartened men appeal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her, who should protect her straightened shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how, through him, her citizens demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Counsel and comfort at their captain’s hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This goodly town, with many miles of plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which lie ’twixt Var and Rhone, upon the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her was given by royal Charlemagne:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such trust he placed in her fidelity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still wont with wonder on the tented plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prowess of that valiant maid to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now the panting courier, as I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rode from Marseilles to ask the lady’s aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether or not she should the call obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youthful damsel doubts some little space;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strong in one balance Fame and Duty weigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But softer thoughts both Fame and Duty chase:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, at length, resolved the emprize to assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And free Rogero from the enchanted place:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, should her valour in the adventure fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would with the cherished lover share his jail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And did with such excuse that post appay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was contented on her will to wait:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then turned the bridle to resume her way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Pinabel, who seemed no whit elate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since of that line he knows the damsel gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Held in such open and such secret hate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And future trouble to himself foresees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were he detected as a Maganzese.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For ’twixt Maganza’s and old Clermont’s line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There was an ancient and a deadly feud:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft to blows the rival houses came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft in civil blood their hands embrued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence some treason to this gentle dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his foul heart, the wicked County brewed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, as the first occasion served, would stray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of the road, and leave her by the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so the traitor’s troubled fancy rack</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fear, doubt, and his own native, rancorous mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That unawares he issued from the track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found himself within a gloomy wood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where a rough mountain reared its shaggy back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose stony peak above the forest stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The daughter of Dodona’s duke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a> behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dogging his footsteps through the thicket blind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, when he saw himself within the brake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought to abandon his unweeting foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the dame⁠—“ ’Twere better that we make</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For shelter ere the gathering darkness grow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, yonder mountain past, (save I mistake)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A tower is seated in the vale below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do you expect me then, while from the peak</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I measure the remembered place I seek.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said, he pushed his courser up the height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that lone mountain; in his evil mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Revolving, as he went, some scheme or sleight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rid him of the gentle dame behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When lo! a rocky cavern met his sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid those precipices dark and blind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its sides descended thirty yards and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worked smooth, and at the bottom was a door.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A void was at the bottom, where a wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Portal conducted to an inner room:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence a light shone out on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As of a torch illumining the gloom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair Bradamant pursued her faithless guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspended there, and pondering on her doom:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And came upon the felon where he stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing lest she might lose him in the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When her approach the County’s first intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made vain, the wily traitor sought to mend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His toils, and some new stratagem invent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rid her thence, or bring her to her end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so to meet the approaching lady went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And showed the cave, and prayed her to ascend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said that in its bottom he had seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A gentle damsel of bewitching mien.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who, by her lovely semblance and rich vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared a lady of no mean degree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But melancholy, weeping, and distressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one who pined there in captivity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that when he towards the entrance pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To learn who that unhappy maid might be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One on the melancholy damsel flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her within that inner cavern drew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beauteous Bradamant, who was more bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than wary, gave a ready ear; and, bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To help the maid, imprisoned in that hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought but the means to try the deep descent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, looking round, descried an elm-tree old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which furnished present means for her intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the tree, with boughs and foliage stored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lopt a long branch, and shaped it with her sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The severed end she to the count commended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, grasping it, hung down that entrance steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her feet foremost, by her arms suspended:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When asking if she had the skill to leap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The traitor, with a laugh, his hands extended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plunged his helpless prey into the deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And thus,” exclaimed the ruffian, “might I speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thee each sucker of thy cursed seed!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But not, as was the will of Pinabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such cruel lot fair Bradamant assayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For striking on the bottom of the cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stout elm-bough so long her weight upstayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, though it split and splintered where it fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It broked her fall, and saved the gentle maid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some while astounded there the lady lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the ensuing canto will display.</span>

				<span>Great fears the women of antiquity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms and hallowed arts as well have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of their worthy works the memory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lustre through this ample world has shone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Praised is Camilla, with Harpalicé,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-256" id="noteref-256" epub:type="noteref">256</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the fair course which they in battle run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Corinna and Sappho, famous for their lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shine two illustrious light, to set no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Women have reached the pinnacle of glory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In every art by them professed, well seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whosoever turns the leaf of story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds record of them, neither dim nor mean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The evil influence will be transitory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If long deprived of such the world had been;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And envious men, and those that never knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their worth, have haply hid their honours due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To me it plainly seems, in this our age</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of women such is the celebrity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it may furnish matter to the page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence this dispersed to future years shall be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you, ye evil tongues which foully rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be tied to your eternal infamy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And women’s praises so resplendent show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They shall, by much, Marphisa’s worth outgo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To her returning yet again; the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him who shewed to her such courteous lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Refused not to disclose her martial name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he agreed to tell the style be bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She quickly satisfied the warrior’s claim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To learn his title she desired so sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I am Marphisa,” the virago cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All else was known, as bruited far and wide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other, since ’twas his to speak, begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With longer preamble: “Amid your train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sirs, it is my belief that there is none</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These I command, as well as all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of their female band have made me head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so would make another who in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like me, ten opposites to death would smite.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>Sir Guido is besought of them to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why there appear so few of the male race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to declare if women there bear sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er men, as men o’er them in other place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He; “Since my fortune has been here to stay,</span>

				<span class="i1">I oftentimes have heard relate the case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now (according to the story told)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will, since it pleases you, the cause unfold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When, after twenty years, the Grecian host</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned from Troy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-257" id="noteref-257" epub:type="noteref">257</a> (ten years hostility</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The town endured, ten weary years were tost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Greeks, detained by adverse winds at sea),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They found their women had, for comforts lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pangs of absence, learned a remedy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, that they might not freeze alone in bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chosen young lovers in their husbands’ stead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With others’ children filled the Grecian crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their houses found, and by consent was past</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pardon to their women; for they knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How ill they could endure so long a fast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the adulterous issue, as their due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek their fortunes on the world were cast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the husbands would not suffer more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The striplings should be nourished from their store.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Some are exposed, and others underhand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their kindly mothers shelter and maintain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the adults, in many a various band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some here, some there dispersed, their living gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arms are the trade of some, by some are scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Letters and arts; another tills the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One serves in court, by other guided go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The herd as pleases her who rules below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A boy departed with they youthful peers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was of cruel Clytemnestra born;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like lily fresh (he numbered eighteen years)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or blooming rose, new-gathered from the thorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He having armed a bark, his pinnace steers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In search of plunder, o’er the billows borne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him a hundred other youths engage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Picked from all Greece, and of their leader’s age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The Cretans, who had banished in that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Idomeneus, the tyrant of their land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And their new state to strengthen and upstay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were gathering arms and levying martial band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Phalantus’ service by their goodly pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Purchased (so hight the youth who sought that strand),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all those others that his fortune run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who the Dictaean city garrison.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Amid the hundred cities of old Crete,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the Dictaean the most rich and bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fair and amorous dames the joyous seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Joyous with festive sports from morn to night:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (as her townsmen aye were wont to greet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger) with such hospitable rite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They welcomed these, it little lacked but they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Granted them o’er their households sovereign sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Youthful and passing fair were all the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flower of Greece, who bold Phalantus led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that with those fair ladies at first view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stealing their hearts, full well the striplings sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, fair in deed as show, they good and true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lovers evinced themselves and bold in bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in few days to them so grateful proved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above all dearest things they were beloved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“After the war was ended on accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For which were hired Phalantus and his train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pay withdrawn, nor longer by the sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was aught which the adventurous youth can gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they, for this, anew would go aboard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unhappy Cretan women more complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fuller tears on this occasion shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That if their fathers lay before them dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Long time and sorely all the striplings bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were, each apart, by them implored to stay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who since the fleeting youths they cannot hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leave brother, sire, and son, with these to stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of jewels and of weighty sums of gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spoiling their households ere they wend their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so well was the plot concealed, no wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout all Crete was privy to their flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So happy was the hour, so fair the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When young Phalantus chose his time to flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They many miles had left the isle behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere Crete lamented her calamity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, uninhabited by human kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This shore received them wandering o’er the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas here they settled, with the plunder reft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better weighed the issue of their theft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With amorous pleasures teemed this place of rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ten days, to that roving company:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as oft happens that in youthful breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abundance brings with it satiety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To quit their women, with one wish possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The band resolved to win their liberty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For never burden does so sore oppress</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As woman, when her love breeds weariness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They, who are covetous of spoil and gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ill-bested withal in stipend, know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That better means are wanted to maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many paramours, than shaft and bow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaving thus alone the wretched train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence, with their riches charged the adventurers go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Puglia’s pleasant land: there founded near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sea, Tarentum’s city, as I hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The women when they find themselves betrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of lovers by whose faith they set most store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many days remain so sore dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they seem lifeless statues on the shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But seeing lamentations nothing aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fruitless are the many tears they pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begin to meditate, amid their pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What remedy for such an ill remains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Some laying their opinions now before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The others, deem, ‘that to return to Crete</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is in their sad estate the wiser lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throwing themselves at sire and husband’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in those wilds, and on that desert shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pine of want.’ Another troop repeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘They should esteem it were a worthier notion</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cast themselves into the neighbouring ocean;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And lighter ill, if they as harlots went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the world⁠—beggars or slaves to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than offer up themselves for punishment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well merited by their iniquity.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such and like schemes the unhappy dames present,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each harder than the other. Finally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One Orontea amid these upstood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who drew her origin from Minos’ blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Youngest and fairest of the crew betrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She was, and wariest, and who least had erred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to Phalantus’ arms had come a maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left for him her father: she in word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as in a kindling face, displayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How much with generous wrath her heart was stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, reprobating all advised before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spake; and adopted saw her better lore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘She would not leave the land they were upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose soil was fruitful, and whose air was sane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout which many limpid rivers ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shaded with woods, and for the most part plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With creek and port, where stranger bark could shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foul wind or storm, which vexed the neighbouring main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That might from Afric or from Egypt bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victual or other necessary thing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘For vengeance (she opined) they there should stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon man’s sex, which had so sore offended.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She willed each bark and crew which to that bay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For shelter from the angry tempest wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They should, without remorse, burn, sack, and slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor mercy be to any one extended.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such was the lady’s motion, such the course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Adopted; and the statute put in force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The women, when they see the changing heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turbid with tempest, hurry to the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With savage Orontea, by whom given</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the fell law, the ruler of the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of all barks into their haven driven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make havoc dread with fire and murderous brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving no man alive, who may diffuse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon this side or that the dismal news.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Twas thus with the male sex at enmity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some years the lonely women lived forlorn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then found that hurtful to themselves would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The scheme, save changed; for if from them were born</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None to perpetuate their empery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The idle law would soon be held in scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fail together with the fruitful reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which they had hoped eternal should remain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So that some deal its rigour they allay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in four years, of all who made repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, by chance conducted to this bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chose out ten vigorous cavaliers and fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for endurance in the amorous play</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against those hundred dames good champions were:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred they; and, of the chosen men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A husband was assigned to every ten.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ere this, too feeble to abide the test,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many a one on scaffold lost his head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now these ten warriors so approved the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were made partakers of their rule and bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First swearing at the sovereign ladies’ hest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘That they, if others to that port are led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No mercy shall to any one afford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But one and all will put them to the sword.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To swell, and next to child, and thence to fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The women turned to teeming wives, began,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest they in time so many males should bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might invade the sovereignty they plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that the government they hold so dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might finally from them revert to man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so, while these are children yet, take measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They never shall rebel against their pleasure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That the male sex may not usurp the sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is enacted by the statute fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Each mother should one boy preserve, and slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The others, or abroad exchange or sell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, they these to various parts convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the bearers of the children tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To truck the girls for boys in foreign lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or not, at least, return with empty hands.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor by the women one preserved would be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If they without them could the race maintain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such all their mercy, all the clemency</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The law accords for <em>theirs</em>, not <em>others’</em> gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dames all others sentence equally;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And temper but in this their statute’s pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, not as was their former practice, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All in their rage promiscuously slay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Did ten or twenty persons, or yet more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrive, they were imprisoned and put by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every day one only from the store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of victims was brought out by lot to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fane by Orontea built, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An altar raised to Vengeance; and to ply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As headsman, and dispatched the unhappy men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One was by lot selected from the ten.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To that foul murderous shore by chance did fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After long years elapsed, a youthful wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose fathers sprung from good Alcides were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, of proof in arms, Elbanio hight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There was he seized, of peril scarce aware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As unsuspecting such a foul despite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, closely guarded, into prison flung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kept for like cruel use the rest among.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Adorned with every fair accomplishment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of pleasing face and manners was the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of a speech so sweet and eloquent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him the deaf adder might have stopt to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that of him to Alexandria went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tidings as of a precious thing and rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She was the daughter of that matron bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Queen Orontea, that yet lived, though old.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet Orontea lived, while of that shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other settlers all were dead and gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now ten times as many such or more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had into strength and greater credit grown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for ten forges, often closed, in store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have the ill-furnished band more files than one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the ten champions have as well the care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To welcome shrewdly all who thither fare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Young Alexandria, who the blooming peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Burned to behold so praised on every part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The special pleasure him to see and hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Won from her mother; and, about to part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him, discovers that the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remains the master of her tortured heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds herself bound, and that ’tis vain to stir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A captive made by her own prisoner.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I pity,’ (said Elbanio) ‘lady fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in this cruel region known, as through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All other countries, near or distant, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wandering sun sheds light and colouring hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I by your beauty’s kindly charms should dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Which make each gentle spirit bound to you)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To beg my life; which always, at your will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should I be ready for your love to spill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘But since deprived of all humanity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are human bosoms in this cruel land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall not now request my life of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For fruitless would, I know, be the demand)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, whether a good knight or bad I be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ask but like such to die with arms in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not as one condemned to penal pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or like brute beast in sacrifice be slain.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The gentle maid, her eye bedimmed with tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pity for the hapless youth, replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Though this land be more cruel and severe</span>

				<span class="i1">Than any other country, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each woman is not a Medaea here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As thou wouldst make her; and, if all beside</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And though I, like so many here, of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was full of evil deeds and cruelty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I can well say, I never had before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fitting subject for my clemency.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fiercer were I than a tiger, more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hard were my heart than diamonds, if in me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All hardness did not vanish and give place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before your courage, gentleness, and grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Ah! were the cruel statute less severe</span>

				<span class="i1">So should I not esteem my death too dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A ransom for thy worthier life were paid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But none is here so great, sir cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor of such puissance as to lend thee aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what thou askest, though a scanty grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were difficult to compass in this place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And yet will I endeavour to obtain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thee, before thou perish, this content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though much, I fear, ’twill but augment thy pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thee protracted death but more torment.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘So I the ten encounter,’ (said again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Elbanio), ‘I at heart, am confident</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myself to save, and enemies to slay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though made of iron were the whole array.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To this the youthful Alexandria nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made answer, saving with a piteous sigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the conference a bosom brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gored with deep wounds, beyond all remedy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Orontea she repaired, and wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her to will the stripling should not die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should he display such courage and such skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As with his single hand the ten to kill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Queen Orontea straightway bade unite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her council, and bespoke the assembled band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘It still behoves us place the prowest wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom we can find, to guard our ports and strand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to discover whom to take or slight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis fitting that we prove the warrior’s hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest, to our loss, the election made be wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we enthrone the weak and slay the strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I deem it fit, if you the counsel shown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deem fit as well, in future to ordain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That each upon our coast by Fortune thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before he in the temple shall be slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall have the choice, instead of this, alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Battle against ten others to maintain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if he conquer, shall the port defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other comrades, pardoned to that end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I say this, since to strive against our ten,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems, that one imprisoned here will dare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, if he stands against so many men,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Heaven, deserves that we should hear his prayer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if he rashly boasts himself, again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As worthily due the punishment should bear.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Orontea ceased; on the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her the oldest of the dames replied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘The leading cause, for which to entertain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This intercourse with men we first agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was not because we, to defend this reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of their assistance stood in any need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For we have skill and courage to maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This of ourselves, and force, withal, to speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would that we could in all as well avail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without their succour, nor succession fail!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘But since this may not be, we some have made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(These few) partakers of our company;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, ten to one, we be not overlaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor they possess them of the sovereignty.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that we for protection need their aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But simply to increase and multiply.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than be their powers to this sole fear addressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be they sluggards, idle for the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘To keep among us such a puissant wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our first design would render wholly vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If one can singly slay ten men in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How many women can he not restrain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If our ten champions had possessed such might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They the first day would have usurped the reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To arm a hand more powerful than your own</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is an ill method to maintain the throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Reflect withal, that if your prisoner speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he kill ten champions in the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred women’s cry, whose lords will bleed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath his falchion, shall your ears dismay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him not ’scape by such a murderous deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, if he would, propound some other way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Yet if he of those ten supply the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And please a hundred women, grant him grace.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This was severe Artemia’s sentiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was she named) and had her counsel weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Elbanio to the temple had been sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To perish by the sacrificial blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Orontea, willing to content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her daughter, to the matron answer made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And urged so many reasons, and so wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The yielding senate granted what she ought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Elbanio’s beauty (for so fair to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never was any cavalier beside)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So strongly works upon the youthful crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in that council sit the state to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the opinion of the older few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That like Artemia think, is set aside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And little lacks but that the assembled race</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Absolve Elbanio by especial grace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To pardon him in fine the dames agreed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, after slaying his half-score, and when</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in the next assault as well should speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not with a hundred women, but with ten;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, furnished to his wish with arms and steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next day he was released from dungeon-den,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And singly with ten warriors matched in plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who by his arm successively were slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He to new proof was put the following night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against ten damsels naked and alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When so successful was the stripling’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took the ’say of all the troop, and won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such grace with Orontea, that the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by the dame adopted for her son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from her Alexandria had to wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With those whom he had proved in amorous strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And him she left with Alexandria, heir</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this famed city, which from her was hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So he and all who his successors were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should guard the law which willed, whatever wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conducted hither by his cruel star,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon this miserable land did light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should have his choice to perish by the knife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or singly with ten foes contend to strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if he should dispatch the men by day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At night should prove him with the female crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if so fortunate that in this play</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He proved again the conqueror, he, as due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The female band, as prince and guide, should sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his ten consorts at his choice renew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reign with them, till other should arrive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of stouter hand, and him of life deprive.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They for two thousand years nigh past away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This usage have maintained, and yet maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The impious rite; and rarely passes day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But stranger wight is slaughtered in the fane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he, Elbanio-like, ten foes assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And such sometimes is found) he oft is slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the first charge: nor, in a thousand, one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other feat, of which I spake, has done,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet some there are have done it, though so few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They may be numbered on the fingers; one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the victorious cavaliers, but who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reigned with his ten short time, was Argilon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, smote by me, whom ill wind hither blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight to his eternal rest is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would I with him that day had filled a grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than in such scorn survive a slave!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For amorous pleasures, laughter, game, and play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which evermore delight the youthful breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gem, the purple garment, rich array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in his city place before the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little, by Heaven, the wretched man appay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of his liberty is dispossest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not to have the power to leave this shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me seems shameful servitude and sore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To know I wear away life’s glorious spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such effeminate and slothful leisure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is to my troubled heart a constant sting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And takes away the taste of every pleasure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fame bears my kindred’s praise on outstretched wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even to the skies; and haply equal measure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of the glories of my blood might share</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I united with my brethren were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Methinks my fate does such injurious deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By me, condemned to servitude so base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he who turns to grass the generous steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To run amid the herd of meaner race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because unfit for war or worthier meed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through blemish, or disease of sight or pace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor hoping but by death, alas! to fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vile a service, I desire to die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here Guido ceased to address the martial peers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cursed withal the day, in high disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he achieved o’er dames and cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The double victory which bestowed that reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho hides his name, and silent hears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until to him by many a sign is plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That this Sir Guido is, as he had said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The issue of his kinsman Aymon’s bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then cried; “The English duke, Astolpho, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy cousin am,” and clipt him round the waist,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a kindly act of courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not without weeping, kist him and embraced.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, “Kinsman dear, thy birth to certify</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No better sign thy mother could have placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About thy neck. Enough! that sword of thine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And courage, vouch thee of our valiant line.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Guido, who gladly would in other place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So near a kin have welcomed, in dismay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds him here and with a mournful face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowing, if he himself survives the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho will be doomed to slavery base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fate deferred but till the following day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he shall perish, if the duke is free:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that one’s good the other’s ill shall be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He grieves, as well, the other cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should through his means for ever captive be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, that he should, if slain, those martial peers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deliver by <em>his</em> death from slavery.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since if Marphisa from one quicksand clears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The troop, yet these from other fails to free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She will have won the victory in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For they will be enslaved, and she be slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the other hand, the stripling’s age, in May</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of youth, with courtesy and valour fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the maid and comrades with such sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touching their breasts with love and pity, wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they of freedom, for which he must pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The forfeit of his life, nigh loathed the thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if Marphisa him perforce must kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She is resolved as well herself to spill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Join thou with us,” she to Sir Guido cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And we from hence will sally.”⁠—“From within</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These walls to sally”⁠—Guido on his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Answered, “Ne’er hope: With me you lose or win.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I fear not, I,” the martial maid replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To execute whatever I begin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor know what can securer path afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that which I shall open with my sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Such proof of thy fair prowess have I made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thee I every enterprise would dare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To-morrow when about the palisade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crowds assembled in the circus are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let us on every side the mob invade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether they fly or for defence prepare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then give the town to fire, and on their bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of earth to wolf and vulture leave the dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He; “Ready shalt thou find me in the strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow thee, or perish at thy side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let us hope not to escape with life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough, is vengeance somedeal satisfied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere death; for oft ten thousand, maid and wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I in the place have witnessed; and, outside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many castle, wall and port, defend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor know I certain way from hence to wend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And were there more (Marphisa made reply)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Xerxes led, our squadrons to oppose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than those rebel spirits from the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast out to dwell amid perpetual woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All in one day should by this weapon die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wert thou with me, at least, not with my foes.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her again, “No project but must fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Sir Guido said) I know, save this avail.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This only us can save, should it succeed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, which but now remembered I shall teach.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To dames alone our laws the right concede</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sally, or set foot upon the beach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence to one of mine in this our need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must I commit myself, and aid beseech;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose love for me, by perfect friendship tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has oft by better proof than this been tried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No less than me would she desire that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should ’scape from slavery, so she went with me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, without her rival’s company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She of my lot should sole partaker be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She bark or pinnace, in the harbour nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall bid, while yet ’tis dark, prepare for sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which shall await your sailors, rigged and yare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sailing, when they thither shall repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Behind me, in a solid band comprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye merchants, mariners and warriors, who,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Driven to this city, have set up your rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath this roof, (for which my thanks are due)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—You have to force your way with steadfast breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If adversaries interrupt our crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis thus I hope, by succour of the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To clear a passage through the cruel horde.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Do as thou wilt,” Marphisa made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I of escape am confident withal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And likelier ’twere that by my hand should die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The martial race, encompassed by this wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than any one should ever see me fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or guess by other sign that fears appal.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I would my passage force in open day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shameful in my sight were other way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I wot if I were for a woman known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Honour and place from women I might claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here gladly entertained, and classed as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply among their chiefs of highest fame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But privilege or favour will I none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unshared by those with whom I hither came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too base it were, did I depart or free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remain, to leave the rest in slavery.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These speeches by Marphisa made, and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Showed that what only had restrained her arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the respect she to the safety bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the companions whom her wrath might harm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By this alone withheld form taking sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And signal vengeance on the female swarm.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence she left in Guido’s care to shape</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What seemed the fittest means for their escape.</span>

				<span>Sir Guido speaks that night with Alery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So the most faithful of his wives was hight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor needs long prayer to make the dame agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disposed already to obey the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She takes a ship and arms the bark for sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stowed with her richest chattels for their flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigning design, as soon as dawn ensues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sail with her companions on a cruise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She into Guido’s palace had before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bid sword and spear and shield and cuirass bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the intent to furnish from this store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Merchants and sailors that half naked were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some watch, and some repose upon the floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rest and guard among each other share;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oft marking, still with harness on their backs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ruddy yet with light the orient wax.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not yet from earth’s hard visage has the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifted her veil of dim and dingy dye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarcely Lycaon’s child, her furrow done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has turned about her ploughshare in the sky;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-258" id="noteref-258" epub:type="noteref">258</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to the theatre the women run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would the fearful battle’s end espy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As swarming bees upon their threshold cluster,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bent on change of realm in springtide muster.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With warlike trumpet, drum, and sound of horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people make the land and welkin roar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Summoning thus their chieftain to return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And end of unfinished warfare. Covered o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With arms stand Aquilant and Gryphon stern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the redoubted duke from England’s shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, Dudo, Sansonet, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knights or footmen harboured in that hall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hence to descend towards the sea or port</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The way across the place of combat lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was there other passage, long or short.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Guido so to his companions cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having ceased his comrades to exhort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To do their best set forth in silent wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the place appeared, amid the throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Head of a squad above a hundred strong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Toward the other gate Sir Guido went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurrying his band, but, gathered far and nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty multitude, for aye intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To smite, and clad in arms, when they descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The comrades whom he leads, perceive his bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And truly deem he is about to fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All in a thought betake them to their bows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the portal part the knight oppose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Guido and the cavaliers who go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath that champion’s guidance, and before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The others bold Marphisa, were not slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To strike, and laboured hard to force the door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such a storm of darts from ready bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dealing on all sides death, or wounding sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was rained in fury on the troop forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They feared at last to encounter skaith and scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of proof the corslet was each warrior wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who without this would have had worse to fear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonnet’s horse was slain, and that which bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa: to himself the English peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed, “Why wait I longer? As if more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My horn could ever succour me than here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since the sword steads not, I will make assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If with my bugle I can clear the way.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As he was customed in extremity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to his mouth applied the bugle’s round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wide world seemed to tremble, earth and sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he in air discharged the horrid sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such terror smote the dames, that bent to fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in their ears the deafening horn was wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only they the gate unguarded left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from the circus reeled, of wit bereft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As family, awaked in sudden wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaps from the windows and from lofty height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Periling life and limb, when in surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They see, now near, the fire’s encircling light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had, while slumber sealed their heavy eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By little and by little waxed at night:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reckless of life, thus each, impelled by dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At sound of that appalling bugle fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above, below, and here and there, the rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rise in confusion and attempt to fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At once, above a thousand swarm about</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each entrance, to each other’s lett, and lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In heaps: from window these, or stage without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leap headlong; in the press these smothered die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broken is many an arm, and many a head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one lies crippled, and another dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid the mighty ruin which ensued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cries pierce the very heavens on every part.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er the sound is heard, the multitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In panic at the deafening echo, start.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When you are told that without hardihood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appear the rabble, and of feeble heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This need not more your marvel; for by nature</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hare is evermore a timid creature.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But of Marphisa what will be your thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Guido late so furious?⁠—of the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young sons of Olivier, that lately wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such deeds in honour of their lineage? who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lately a hundred thousand held as nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, deprived of courage, basely flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As ring-doves flutter and as coneys fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hear some mighty noise resounding nigh.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For so to friend as stranger, noxious are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The powers that in the enchanted horn reside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet, Guido, follow, with the pair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-259" id="noteref-259" epub:type="noteref">259</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or brethren bold, Marphisa terrified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor flying, can they to such distance fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that their ears are dinned. On every side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho, on his foaming courser borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lends louder breath to his enchanted horn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One sought the sea, and one the mountain-top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One fled the hide herself in forest hoar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this, who turned not once nor made a stop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not for ten days her headlong flight forbore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These from the bridge in that dread moment drop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never to climb the river’s margin more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So temple, house, and square and street were drained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That nigh unpeopled the wide town remained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, Guido, and the brethren two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Sansonetto, pale and trembling, hie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the sea, and behind these the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of frighted mariners and merchants fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ’twixt the forts, in bark, prepared with view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To their escape, discover Alery;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in sore haste receives the warriors pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bids them ply their oars and make all sail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke within and out the town had beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the surrounding hills to the sea-side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of its people emptied every street.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All fly before the deafening sound, and hide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many in panic, seeking a retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurk, in some place obscure and filthy stied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many, not knowing whither to repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunge in the neighbouring sea, and perish there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke arrives, seeking the friendly band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he had hoped to find upon the quay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turns and gazes round the desert strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And none is there⁠—directs along the bay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His eyes, and now, far distant from the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds the parting frigate under way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the paladin, for his escape⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vessel gone⁠—must other project shape.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let him depart! nor let it trouble you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he so long a road must beat alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, never without fear, man journeys through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wild paynim countries: danger is there none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what he with his bugle may eschew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose dread effect the English duke has shown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let his late companions be our care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who trembling to the beach had made repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They from that cruel and ensanguined ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seaward, under all their canvas, bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having gained such offing, that the sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that alarming horn was heard no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unwonted shame inflicted such a wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all a face of burning crimson wore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One dares not eye the other, and they stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With downcast looks, a mute and mournful band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fixed on his course, the pilot passes by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cyprus and Rhodes, and ploughs the Aegean sea:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds a hundred islands from him fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Malea’s fearful headland; fanned by free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And constant wind, sees vanish from the eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Greek Morea; rounding Sicily,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the Tuscan sea his frigate veers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, coasting Italy’s fair region, steers:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Last rises Luna, where his family</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is waiting his return, the patron hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gives thanks to God at having passed the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more harm, and makes the well-known shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, offering passage to their company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They find a master, ready to unmoor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For France, and that same day his pinnace climb;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence wafted to Marseilles in little time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><em>There</em> was not Bradamant, who used to sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The land, and had that city in her care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who (if present there) to make some stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have compelled them by her courteous prayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They disembarked; and that same hour away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did bold Marphisa at a venture fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding adieu to salvage Guido’s wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the four, her comrades in the strife:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saying, “she deems unfitting for a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fare in like great fellowship; that so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The starlings and the doves in flock unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every beast who fears⁠—the stag and doe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But hawk and eagle, that in other’s might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put not their trust, for ever singly go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lion, bear, and tiger, roam alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fear no prowess greater than their own.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But none with her opine, and, in the lack</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a companion, singly must she fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So then, alone and friendless, she a track</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uncouth pursues, and through a wooded lair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon the white and Aquilant the black</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Take road more beaten with the other pair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the following day a castle see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within which they are harboured courteously.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Courteously I, in outward show, would say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For soon the contrary was made appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he, the castellain, who with display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of kindness sheltered them and courteous cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The night ensuing took them as they lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Couched in their beds, secure and void of fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from the snare would he his prisoners loose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they had sworn to observe an evil use.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But I will first pursue the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere more of these, fair sir, I shall proclaim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the Durence, Rhone, and Saône she strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the foot of sunny mountain came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there approaching in black gown arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside a torrent, saw an ancient dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with long journey weak, and wearied sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared, but pined by melancholy more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was the beldam who had wont to ply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serving the robbers in the caverned mount;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither stern Justice sent (that they might die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that good paladin) Anglante’s count.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The aged harridan, for cause which I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you shall in another place recount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now many days by path obscure had flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still fearing lest her visage should be known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The semblance now of foreign cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in Marphisa saw, in arms and vest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence she flies not her, though wont to fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As being natives of that land) the rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nay, with security and open cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stops at the ford the damsel to arrest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stops at the ford⁠—where that old beldam meets</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, and with fair encounter greets.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And next implored the maid, she of her grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would bear her on the croupe to the other shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, who was come of gentle race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hag with her across the torrent bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is content to bear, till she can place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a securer road the beldam hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clear of a spacious marish: as its end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They see a cavalier towards them wend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In shining armour and in fair array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior rode on saddle richly wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the river, and upon his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him a single squire and damsel brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of passing beauty was the lady gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But little pleasing was her semblance haught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All overblown with insolence and pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy the cavalier who was her guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He of Maganza was a count, who bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady with him (Pinabello hight):</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The same who Bradamant, some months before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had plunged into a hollow cave in spite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those many sobs, those burning sighs and sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those tears which had nigh quenched the warrior’s sight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All for the damsel were, now at his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then by that false necromancer stied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when the magic tower upon the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was razed, the dwelling of Atlantes hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every one was free to rove at will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through Bradamant’s good deed and virtuous lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel, who had been compliant still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the desires of Pinabel before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rejoined him, and now journeying in a round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him, from castle was to castle bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As wanton and ill-customed, when she spies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa’s aged charge approaching near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She cannot rein her saucy tongue, but plies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, in her petulance, with laugh and jeer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa haught, unwont in any wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outrage from whatsoever part to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes answer to the dame, in angry tone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That “handsomer than her she deems the crone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And that she this would prove upon her knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pact that she might strip the bonnibell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of gown and palfrey, if, o’erthrown in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her champion from his goodly courser fell.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—In silence to have overpast the slight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have been sin and shame in Pinabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for short answer seized his shield and spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wheeled, and drove at her in fierce career.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa grasped a mighty lance, and thrust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encountering him, at Pinabello’s eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stretched him so astounded in the dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That motionless an hour the warrior lies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, now victorious in the just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave orders to strip off the glorious guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ornaments wherewith the maid was drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the spoils her ancient crone invest;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And willed that she should don the youthful weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bedizened at the haughty damsel’s cost;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And took away as well the goodly steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which her had thither borne, and⁠—bent to post</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her old track⁠—with her the hag will speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seems most hideous when adorned the most.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three days the tedious road the couple beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without adventure needful to repeat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the fourth day they met a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who came in fury galloping alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you the stranger’s name desire to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I tell you ’twas Zerbino, a king’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of beauty and of worth example rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now grieved and angered, as unvenged of one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who a great act of courtesy, which fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior would have done, had rendered vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Vainly the young Zerbino, through the glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had chased that man of his, who this despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had done him, who himself so well conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Away and took such ’vantage in his flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hid by wood and mist, which overlaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horizon and bedimmed the morning-light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he escaped Zerbino’s grasp, and lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed until his wrath was past away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino laughed parforce, when he descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That beldam’s face, though he was full of rage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For too ill-sorted seemed her vest of pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her foul visage, more deformed by age;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the proud Marphisa, at her side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prince, exclaimed, “Sir warrior, you are sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In having chosen damsel of a sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom none, I ween, will grudge you should escort.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Older than Sibyl seemed the beldam hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As far as from her wrinkles one might guess),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the youthful ornaments she wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Looked like an ape which men in mockery dress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now appears more foul, as angered sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While rage and wrath her kindled eyes express.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For none can do a woman worse despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to proclaim her old and foul to sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To have sport of him⁠—as she had⁠—an air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wrath the maid assumed upon her part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the prince, “By Heaven, more passing fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is this my lady than thou courteous art,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed in answer; “though I am aware</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What thou hast uttered comes not from thy heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou wilt not own her beauty; a device</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put on to masque thy sovereign cowardice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And of what stamp would be that cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who found such fair and youthful dame alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without protection, in the forest drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sought to make the lovely weft his own?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“So well she sorts with thee,” replied the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“ ’Twere ill that she were claimed by any one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor I of her would thee in any wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deprive; God rest thee merry with thy prize!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But wouldst thou prove what is my chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On other ground I to thy wish incline;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet deem me not of such perversity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to tilt with thee for this prize of thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or fair or foul, let her remain thy fee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I would not, I, such amity disjoin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well are ye paired, and safely would I swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou as valiant art as she is fair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him Marphisa, “Thou in thy despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shalt try to bear from me the dame away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will not suffer that so fair a sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou shouldst behold, nor seek to gain the prey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her the prince, “I know not wherefore wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should suffer pain and peril in affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Striving for victory, where, for his pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The victor losses, and the vanquished gains.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If this condition please not, other course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ill thou canst refuse, I offer thee,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Marphisa cried): “If thou shalt me unhorse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this our tourney, she remains with me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if I win, I give her thee parforce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then prove we now who shall without her be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Premised, if loser, thou shalt be her guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherever it may please the dame to ride.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And be it so,” Zerbino cried, and wheeled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swiftly his foaming courser for the shock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rising in his stirrups scowered the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm in his seat, and smote, with levelled stock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For surer aim, the damsel in mid-shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she sate steadfast as a metal rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the warrior’s morion thrust so well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She clean out-bore him senseless from the sell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much grieved the prince, to whom in other fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The like misfortune had not chanced before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had unhorsed some thousands in his day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now shamed, he thought for ever. Troubled sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mute long space upon the ground he lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when ’twas recollected, grieved the more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he had promised, and that he was bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To accompany the hag where’er she wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Turning about to him the victoress cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laughing, “This lady I to thee present,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the more beauty is in her descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The more that she is thine I am content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now in my place her champion and her guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But do not thou thy plighted faith repent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that thou fail, as promised, to attend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame, wherever she may please to wend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Without awaiting answer, to career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She spurred her horse, and vanished in the wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, deeming her a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cried to the crone, “By whom am I subdued?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, knowing ’twould be poison to his ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that it would inflame his angered blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in reply, “It was a damsel’s blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from thy lofty saddle laid thee low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She, for her matchless force, deservedly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Usurps from cavalier the sword and lance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And even from the east is come to try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her strength against the paladins of France.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only was his cheek of crimson dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such shame Zerbino felt as his mischance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little was wanting (so his blushes spread)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all the arms he wore had glowed as red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He mounts, and blames himself in angry wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he had no better kept his seat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within herself the beldam laughs, and tries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Scottish warrior more to sting and heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him for promised convoy she applies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, who knows that there is no retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stands like tired courser, who in pensive fit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hangs down his ears, controlled by spur and bit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, sighing deeply, cries, in his despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Fell Fortune, with what change dost thou repay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My loss! she who was fairest of the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who should be mine, by thee is snatched away!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thinkest thou the evil to repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her whom thou hast given to me this day?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than make like ill exchange, less cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It were to undergo a total loss.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her, who for virtue and for beauteous form</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never equalled, nor will ever be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou on the rocks hast wrecked, in wintry storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As food for fowls and fishes of the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her who should have fed the earth-bred worm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou hast delivered from her destiny;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Preserved beyond her date, some ten or score</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of years, to harass and torment me more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake Zerbino, and like grief displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his despairing words and woful mien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such an odious acquisition made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he had suffered when he lost his queen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The aged woman now, from what he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though she before Zerbino had not seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perceived ’twas him of whom, in the thieves’ hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Isabel of Gallicia erst had told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If you remember what was said before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was the hag who ’scaped out of the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Isabella, who had wounded sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino’s heart, was long detained a slave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who oft had told how she her native shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had left, and, launching upon ocean’s wave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her frigate, had been wrecked by wind and swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the rocky shallows near Rochelle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she to <em>her</em> Zerbino’s goodly cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gentle features had portrayed so well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the hag hearing him, and now more near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Letter her eyes upon his visage dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discerned it was the youth for whom, whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had grieved at heart the prisoned Isabel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose loss she in the cavern more deplored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than being captive to the murderous horde.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beldam, hearing what in rage and grief</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino vents, perceives the youth to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deceived, and cheated by the false belief</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Isabel had perished in the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And though she might have given the prince relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowing the truth, in her perversity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What would have made him joyful she concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And only what would cause him grief revealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hear, you that are so proud,” (the hag pursues)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And flout me with such insolence and scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You would entreat me fair to have the news</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know of her whose timeless death you mourn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to be strangled would I rather choose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be into a thousand pieces torn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereas if you had made me kinder cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply from me the secret might you hear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the dog’s rage is quickly overblown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who flies the approaching robber to arrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If the thief proffer piece of bread or bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of offer other lure which likes him best;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As readily Zerbino to the crone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Humbled himself, and burned to know the rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, in the hints of the old woman, read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she had news of her he mourned as dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with more winning mien to her applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her did supplicate, entreat, conjure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By men and gods, the truth no more to hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did she benign or evil lot endure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hard and pertinacious crone replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nought shalt thou hear, thy comfort to assure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Isabel has not yielded up her breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But lives a life she would exchange for death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She, since thou heardest of her destiny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within few days, has fallen into the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of more than twenty. If restored to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Think now, if thou hast hope to crop her flower.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Curst hag, how well thou shapest thy history,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet knowest it is false! Her virgin dower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure from brutal wrong, would none invade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though in the power of twenty were the maid.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Questioning of the maid, he when and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw her, vainly asked the beldam hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, ever restive to Zerbino’s prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To what she had rehearsed would add no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prince in the beginning spoke her fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next to cut her throat in fury swore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But prayers and menaces alike were weak;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could he make the hideous beldam speak.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At length Zerbino to his tongue gave rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since speaking to the woman booted nought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarcely his heart found room within his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such dread suspicion had her story wrought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to find Isabella was so pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her in the midst of fire he would have sought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But could not hurry more than was allowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her his convoy, since he so had vowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They hence, by strange and solitary way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rove, as the beldam does her will betoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor climbing, nor descending hill, survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each other’s face, nor any word is spoken.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the sun upon the middle day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had turned his back, their silence first was broken</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By cavalier encountered in their way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What followed the ensuing strain will say.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Zerbino for Gabrina, who a heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of asp appears to bear, contends. O’erthrown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Fleming falls upon the other part,</span>

					<span class="i1">Through cause of that despised and odious crone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wounded sore, and writhing with the smart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beldam’s treason to the prince makes known,</span>

			<p>
				<span>No cord I well believe is wound so tight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round chest, nor nails the plank so fastly hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Faith enwraps an honourable sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In its secure, inextricable, fold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor holy Faith, it seems, except in white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was mantled over in the days of old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So by the ancient limner ever painted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As by one speck, one single blemish tainted.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Faith should be kept unbroken evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With one or with a thousand men united;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well if given in grot or forest hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remote from town and hamlet, as if plighted</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid a crowd of witnesses, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tribunal, and in act and deed recited:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor needs the solemn sanction of an oath:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is sufficient that we pledge our troth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this maintains as it maintained should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In each emprize the Scottish cavalier,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-260" id="noteref-260" epub:type="noteref">260</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gives good proof of his fidelity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quitting his road with that old crone to steer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although this breeds the youth such misery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As ’twould to have Disease itself as near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or even Death; but with him heavier weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That his desire the promise he had made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of him I told who felt at heart such load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reflecting she beneath his charge must go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He spake no word; and thus in silent mode</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both fared: so sullen was Zerbino’s woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I said how vexed their silence, as they rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was broke, when Sol his hindmost wheels did show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By an adventurous errant cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in mid pathway met the crone and peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hag, who the approaching warrior knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Hermonides of Holland he was hight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That bore upon a field of sable hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bar of vermeil tint, transversely dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did humbly now to good Zerbino sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Her pride abased, and look of haught despite⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him reminded of the promise made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When her Marphisa to his care conveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because as foe to <em>her</em> and <em>hers</em> she knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight they were encountering, who had slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her only brother and her father true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was advised, the traitor would be fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her, the remnant of her race, to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What he had perpetrated on the twain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Woman, while guarded by my arm (he said),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will not thou shouldst any danger dread.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As nearer now, the stranger knight espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That face, which was so hateful in his sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With menacing and savage voice he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Either with me prepare thyself to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or arm thee not on that old woman’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who by my hand shall perish, as is right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou contendest for her, thou art slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such their portion is who wrong maintain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him young Zerbino answered courteously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“ ’Twas sign of evil and ungenerous will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And corresponded not with chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he a woman should desire to kill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet if the knight persists, he will not flee⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bids him well consider first how ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould sound, that he, a gentle knight and good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should wish to dip his hand in woman’s blood.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This and yet more he vainly says; nor stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They idle long; from word they pass to deed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having compass’d on the level land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough of ground, encounter on the mead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not fired in some rejoicing, from the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discharged, so fast the whistling rockets speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the two coursers bear the cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hurtle in mid space with rested spears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hermonides of Holland levelled low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for the youth’s left flank the stroke intended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his weak lance was shivered by the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And little the opposing Scot offended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But vain was not the spear-thrust of his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bored his opposite’s good shield, and rended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shoulder, by the lance pierced through and through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good Hermonides on earth o’erthrew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thinking him slain who only lay amazed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By pity prest, Zerbino leapt to ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his deathlike face the vizor raised;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, as wakened out of sleep profound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In silence, hard upon Zerbino gazed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then cried, “It does not me, in truth, confound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To think that I am overthrown by thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seem’st the flower of errant chivalry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But it with reason grieves me this is done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon account of a false woman’s spite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose wicked cause I know not why you own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An office ill according with your might:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when to you the occasion shall be known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which urges me her wickedness to quite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whene’er you think on it, you will repent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How she by you was saved, and I was shent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if enough of breath, although I fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The contrary, is left me to expound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her evil actions, I shall make appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in all guilt transgresses every bound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I had a brother once: the youthful peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Set out from Holland’s isle, our natal ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To serve Heraclius, ’mid his knights arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who then the Grecian empire’s sceptre swayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Brother in arms and bosom-friend installed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here was he by a baron of that court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, in a pleasant site, and strongly walled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Servia’s distant frontier had a fort.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Argaeus he of whom I tell was called,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Husband of that ill hag, whom in such sort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loved, as passed all mean, and misbecame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One of his worth and honourable fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But she, more volatile than leaf, when breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of autumn most its natural moisture dries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strips the fluttering foliage from the trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, blown about, before its fury flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changes her humour, and her husband sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom she some time had loved, with other eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in her every wish and every thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Schemes how my brother’s love may best be bought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But not Acroceraunus fronts the brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Ill-famed⁠—against whose base the billow heaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor against Boreas stands the mountain pine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That has a hundred times renewed its leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And towering high on Alp or Apennine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With its fast root the rock as deeply cleaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So firmly as the youth resists the will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that foul woman, sink of every ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, as it oft befalls a cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seeks and finds adventure, high and low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It happened that my gentle brother near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His comrade’s fort was wounded by a foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where often, uninvited by the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He guested, was his host with him or no;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither he resorted from the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There to repose until his wounds were healed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“While there he wounded lay, upon some need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It chanced Argaeus was compelled to ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly that wanton, from his presence freed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As was her use, my brother’s fealty tried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, as one unstained in thought and deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fell a goad no longer would abide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to preserve his faith, as lures increased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many evils chose what seemed the least.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To break communion with the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him⁠—of many⁠—seemed the lightest ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And go so far, <em>that</em> wanton should not hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More of his name: this purpose to fulfil</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was honester (though quitting one so dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was hard) than to content her evil will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her foul wishes to her lord impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cherished her as fondly as his heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And though yet smarting with his wounds and pined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He dons his arms, and from the tower departs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wanders thence with firm and constant mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ne’er to return again into those parts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But nought availed the purpose he designed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His projects Fortune baffled with new arts.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while, behold! the castellain returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bathed in bitter tears the wife discerned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And with flushed face, and hair in disarray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He asks of her what had disturbed her mood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, ere she in reply a word will say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is vainly more than once to answer wooed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the while is thinking in what way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight can best with vengeance be pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well it suited with her fickle vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lightly to change her love into disdain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Ah! why should I conceal (in fine she cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fault committed while you were away?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For though I it from all the world should hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This would my conscience to myself bewray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The soul, which is with secret evil dyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does with such penitence its fault appay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As every corporal sufferance exceeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou couldst deal me for my evil deeds;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘If evil <em>be</em> the deed, when done parforce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, be it what it may, the mischief know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, with my sword from this polluted corse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Delivered, let my spotless spirit go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quench these wretched eyes, which in remorse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, if I lived, on earth must ever throw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the least penance of so foul a blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, look on whom they may, must blush for shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘My honour has been ruined by thy mate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to this body violence has done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fearing lest I all to thee relate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without farewell the graceless churl is gone.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She by this story made her husband hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth, than whom before was dearer none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Argaeus credits all, without delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arms him, and, breathing vengeance, posts away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In knowledge of that country not to seek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He overtook the knight in little space;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For my poor brother, yet diseased and weak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rode, unsuspicious, at an easy pace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Argaeus, eager his revenge to wreak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assailed him straight in a sequestered place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My brother would excuse him if he might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his indignant host insists on fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“<em>This</em> one was sound and full of new disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> weak and friendly, as aye wont to be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My brother was ill fitted to sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His altered comrade’s new-born enmity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Philander, then unmeriting such pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was the stripling named, described by me)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not gifted with the power to undergo</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such fierce assault, was taken by the foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Forbid it, Heaven! I should be led astray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So by just wrath and thy iniquity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(To him Argaeus cried) as thee to slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who loved thee once, and certes thou lovedst me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though in the end thou ill didst this display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I yet desire this ample world may see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, measured by my deeds, I rank above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thyself in hate as highly as in love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘In other mode shall I chastise the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than spilling more of thine ill blood.’ The peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This said, commands his followers, on a steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of verdant boughs composed to place a bier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the knight half-lifeless homeward speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a tower enclose the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There dooms the guiltless stripling to remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And suffer prisonment’s perpetual pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet nothing but his former liberty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to depart was wanting to the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all the rest, as one at large and free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ordered, and was still obeyed aright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that ill dame her former phantasy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursuing ever with unwearied sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having the keys, repaired nigh every day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the close turret where the prisoner lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And evermore my brother she assailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with more boldness prest her former suit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Mark what to thee fidelity availed!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(She cries) ‘which all mere perfidy repute.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With what triumphant joy shalt thou be hailed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What noble spoils are thine, what happy fruit!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh what a worthy guerdon is thy meed!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Branded by all men for a traitor’s deed!</span>
			</p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of thine own honour, what I sought of thee!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now of so rigorous mood the worthy gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have and enjoy. In close captivity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou art; nor ever hope to break thy chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless thou soften thy obduracy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, if compliant, I a mean can frame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To render thee thy liberty and fame.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘No, no; have thou no hope,’ (replied the knight,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘That my true faith shall ever change, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It thus should happen that, against all right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should so hard a sentence undergo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let the world blame. Enough that in <b>his</b> sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Who sees and judges every thing below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in <b>his</b> grace divine my fame can clear⁠—</span>

				<span class="i1">My innocence unsullied shall appear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Does not Argaeus deem enough to sty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me in his prison, let him take away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This noisome life. Nor yet may Heaven deny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its meed, though ill the world my work appay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet he who condemns me may, when I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am parted from this tenement of clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perceive that he has wronged me in the end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shall bewail when dead his faithful friend.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thus oftentimes that shameless woman prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The good Philander, but obtained no fruit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nursing her blind desires, which knew not rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In seeking what her wicked love may boot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She her old vices, in her inmost breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ransacks for what may best the occasion suit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sifts them all: then, having overrun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand evil thoughts, resolved on one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Six months she waited ere again she sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prisoner’s tower, as she was wont before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From which the sad Philander hoped and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That love to him the dame no longer bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! Fortune for her an occasion wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(To evil deed propitious evermore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give effect, with memorable ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her irrational and evil will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The husband had an ancient feud with one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was by name Morando hight the fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who even within the fort would often run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In its lord’s absence; but the knight’s repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the wide distance of ten miles would shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was he assured the castellain was there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who now, to lure him thither, bruited how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He for Jerusalem was bound by vow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Said he would go; and went. Thus each who spies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His outset, of his journey spreads the fame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor he, who only on his wife relies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trusts any with his purpose but the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And home returned when dusky waxed the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever, save at evening, thither came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with changed ensigns, at the dawn of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unseen of any, always went his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He now on this side, now on the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roved round his castle but to ascertain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If credulous Morando, who to ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither was wonted, would return again.</span>

				<span class="i1">Thou knowst Morando, know if deities</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or men he in Argaeus’ absence fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He at this time tries all extremities;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor servant have I but by threat or prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He him to further his desire has swayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor know I whither to recur for aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Of my lord’s absence hearing the report,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he would not quickly homeward fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had the insolence within my court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon no other pretext to repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, were my absent lord within his fort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So bold a deer not only would not dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would not deem himself secure withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Heaven! at three miles’ distance from his wall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And what he erst by messenger had sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From me to-day has sued for face to face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in such manner that long time I thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dishonour must have followed and disgrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if I had not humbly him besought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And feigned to yield to him with ready grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He haply would have ravish’d <em>that</em> by force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he expects to win by milder course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I promise, not designing to comply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For void is contract made in fear; alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his ill purpose would I put him by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what he then parforce would else have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So stands the case: the single remedy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lies in yourself: my honour else is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that of my Argaeus; which as dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or more so, than your own you vowed whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘If you refuse me, I shall say, you show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you have not the faith which you pretended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that in cruelty you said me no,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When vainly were my tears on you expended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And no wise for Argaeus’ sake, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this pretext you have yourself defended.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our loves had been concealed and free from blame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here I stand exposed to certain shame.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘To me such preface needs not (said anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The good Philander), bound by amity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To my Argaeus still; thy pleasure shew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I what I ever was will be, and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although from him I bear such ill undue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accuse him not; for him would I defy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even death itself; and let the world, allied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With my ill destiny, against me side!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The impious woman answered, ‘ ’Tis my will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou slay him who would do us foul despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor apprehend to encounter any ill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I the certain mean will tell aright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will return, his purpose to fulfil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the third hour, when darkest is the night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at a preconcerted signal made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be without noise by me within conveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Let it not irk thee to await the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within my chamber, where no light will be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till I shall make him doff his warlike gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, almost naked, yield him up to thee.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So did his wife into that quicksand steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hapless husband (it appears to me)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If wife she rightly could be called; more fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cruel than a fury sprung from hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She drew my brother forth, that guilty night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his good arms in hand, and him again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secreted in the chamber without light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till thither came the wretched castellain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it was ordered, all fell out aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For seldom ill design is schemed in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fell Argaeus by Philander’s sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for Morando took the castle’s lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One blow divided head and neck; for nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was there of helm, the warrior to defend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a struggle was Argaeus brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his unhappy life’s disastrous end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who slew him never had such thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this would have believed: to aid his friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent, (strange chance!) he wrought him in that blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The worst that could be done by mortal foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When now, unknown, on earth Argaeus lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My brother to Gabrina gave the blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was she named) who lived but to betray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, who discovery had till then delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wills that Philander with a light survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The man whom he on earth has lifeless laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, with the assistance of the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shows him Argaeus in the murdered wight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And threatens, save he with desires comply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To which her bosom had been long a prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What he would be unable to deny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to the assembled household will display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he like traitor and assassin die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her tale, in ignominious way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And minds him fame is not to be despised,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit so little life by him be prized.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Philander stood oppressed with grief and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When his mistake to him the woman showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to have slain her in his wrath went near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And long be doubted, so his choler glowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, but that Reason whispered in his ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he was in an enemy’s abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For lack of faulchion in his empty sheath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would have torn her piecemeal with his teeth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As sometimes vessel by two winds which blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From different points is vext upon the main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now one speeds the bark an end, and now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another squall impels her back again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still on her poop assailed, or on her prow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till she before the strongest flies amain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Philander, so distraught by two designs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes what he pregnant with least ill opines.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Reason demonstrates with what peril fraught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His case, not more with death than lasting stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If in the castle were that murder taught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any time has he to sift his brain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will he or nill he, in conclusion nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is left him but the bitter cup to drain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus in his troubled heart prevailing more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fear his resolution overbore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The fear of shameful punishment’s pursuit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made him with many protestations swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grant in every thing Gabrina’s suit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If from the fortilage they safely fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So plucks that impious dame, parforce, the fruit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her desires, and thence retreat the pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus home again the young Philander came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving behind him a polluted name;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And deeply graven in his bosom bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The image of his friend so rashly slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By this to purchase, to his torment sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Progne, a Medea; impious gain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And but his knightly faith, and oaths he swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were to his fury as a curbing rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him when safe she would have met her fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But lived subjected to his bitterest hate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thenceforth he nevermore was seen to smile:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All his discourse was sad, and still ensued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobs from his breast; afflicted in the style</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of vext Orestes, when he in his mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had slain his mother and Egisthus vile;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By vengeful furies for the deed pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till broken by the ceaseless grief he fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sickened and betook himself to bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now in the harlot, when she had discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This other set by her so little store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The former amorous flame was quickly turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into despiteous rage and hatred sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor with less wrath she towards my brother burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than for Argaeus she had felt before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she disposed herself, in treasons versed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay her second husband like the first.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of a deceitful leech she made assay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-261" id="noteref-261" epub:type="noteref">261</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well fitted for the work she had in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who better knew what deadly poisons slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than he the force of healing syrup scanned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And promised him his service to repay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a reward exceeding his demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he should, with some drink of deadly might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her detested husband rid her sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In presence of myself and more beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wicked elder, with his deadly dole,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approaching my unhappy brother, cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘It was a sovereign drink to make him whole.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here a new device Gabrina tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ere the sickly man could taste the bowl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rid her of accomplice in the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or to defraud him of his promised meed,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Seized on his hand, the instant he presented</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The poison to my brother. ‘Ill my fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Exclaimed the dame) by you would be resented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excited for a spouse I hold so dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, that the beverage has not been fermented</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With evil drug and poisonous, will be clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deem it meet that you to him convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The proffered bowl, unless you take the say.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-262" id="noteref-262" epub:type="noteref">262</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In what condition think you, sir, remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wretched elder by his fears opprest?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus by the woman’s suddenness constrained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had no time for thinking what were best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, lest more doubt of him be entertained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tastes of the chalice, at Gabrina’s hest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the sick man, emboldened so, drinks up</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All the remainder of the poisoned cup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As the trained hawk of crooked talon who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clutches the partridge, when about to eat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is by the dog, she deems her comrade true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’ertaken and defrauded of the meat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So on ill gain intent, the leech, in lieu</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the expected aid, received defeat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hear, thus, what sovereign wickedness will dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be like fate each greedy miscreant’s share!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This past and done, the leech would homeward speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, to counteract the pest he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within his bowels, in this fearful need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might use some secret of his cunning lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this the wicked dame would not concede,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forbidding him to issue thence before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His patient’s stomach should the juice digest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And its restoring power be manifest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-263" id="noteref-263" epub:type="noteref">263</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No prayer will move, nor offered price will buy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The woman’s leave to let him thence depart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The desperate man who saw that death was nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sure to follow, quickly changed his part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told the story to the standers-by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could she cover it with all her art.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus what he wont to do by many a one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That goodly doctor by himself has done;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And follows with his soul my brother true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hence, already freed, was gone before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We, the assistants, that the matter knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the old man who lingered little more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took that abominable monster, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More cruel was than beast in forest hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, prisoned in a darksome place, reserved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To perish in the fire, as she deserved.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said Hermonides, and had pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His tale, and told how she from prison fled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But suffered from his wound a pang so shrewd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fell reversed upon his grassy bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile two squires, who served him in the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A rustic bier of sturdy branches spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their master upon this the servants lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who could not thence be borne in other way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino, in excuse, assured the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He grieved so good a knight to have offended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as was still the use of cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had guarded her who in his guidance wended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor had he else preserved his honour clear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For when the dame was to his care commended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to defend his promise he had plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all men, to the utmost of his might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He, if he might, is any thing beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would readily assist him in his need.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“His only wish,” (the cavalier replied,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Was, <em>he</em> might be from ill Gabrina freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere him some mighty mischief should betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of future penitence the bitter seed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gabrina keeps on earth her downcast eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ill the simple truth admits reply.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino thence, upon the promised way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the old woman in his escort, went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And inly cursed her all the livelong day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in her cause that baron he had shent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having heard the knight her guilt display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was instructed in her evil bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He⁠—if before he had her at despite⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So loathed her, she was poison to his sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well read in young Zerbino’s hate, the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not by him in malice be outdone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor bated him an inch, but in that game</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of deadly hatred set him two for one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her face was with the venom in a flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith her swelling bosom overrun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas thus in such concord as I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These through the ancient wood pursued their way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, lo! as it is now nigh eventide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They a mixt sound of blows and outcries hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seem a sign of battle fiercely plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (as the deafening noise demonstrates) near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mark what this might be, towards that side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence came the tumult, moved the Scottish peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is in following him Gabrina slow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What chanced in other canto you shall know.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though, ’mid so many and many, it is clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right few of you are of such constant bent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be not displeased at what I said whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I so bitterly Gabrina shent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor if I yet expend some other verse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In censure of the beldam’s mind perverse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such was she; and I hide not what is true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was enjoined me for a task by one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose will is law; therefore is honour due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To constant heart throughout my story done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who betrayed his master to the Jew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thirty pence, nor Peter wronged, nor John,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less renowned is Hypermnestra’s fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her so many wicked sisters’ shame.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-264" id="noteref-264" epub:type="noteref">264</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For one I dare to censure in my lays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so the story wills which I recite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the other hand, a hundred will I praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And make their virtue dim the sun’s fair light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But turning to the various pile I raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Gramercy! dear to many) of the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Scotland I was telling, who hard-by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had heard, as was rehearsed, a piercing cry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He entered, ’twixt two hills, a narrow way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence was heard the cry; nor far had hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere to a vale he came shut out from day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he before him a dead knight espied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who I shall tell; but first I must away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From France, in the Levant to wander wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till I the paladin Astolpho find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who westward had his course from thence inclined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I in the cruel city left the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence, with the formidable bugle’s roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had chased the unfaithful people in their fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had preserved himself from peril sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the sound had made his comrades rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then sail, and fly with noted scorn that shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now following him, I say, the warrior took</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Armenian road, and so that land forsook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, after some few days, in Natoly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds himself, and towards Brusa goes his ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence wending, on the hither side o’ the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes Thrace; through Hungary by the Danube lays</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His course, and as his horse had wings to flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Traverses in less time than twenty days</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both the Moravian and Bohemian line;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threaded Franconia next, and crost the Rhine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Aix-la-Chapelle thence, through Arden’s wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came and embarked upon the Flemish strand.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-265" id="noteref-265" epub:type="noteref">265</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sea, with southern breeze his vessel stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, so the favouring wind her canvas fanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, at little distance, Albion viewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By noon, and disembarked upon her land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He backed his horse, and so the rowels plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In London he arrived by eventide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, learning afterwards that Otho old</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has lain for many months in Paris-town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that anew nigh every baron bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has after his renowned example done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He straightway does for France his sails unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the mouth of Thames again is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence issuing forth, with all his canvas spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Calais he directs the galley’s head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A breeze which, from the starboard blowing light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had tempted forth Astolpho’s bark to sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By little and by little, waxed in might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so at last obtains the mastery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pilot is constrained to veer outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest by the billows swampt his frigate be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, departing from his first design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Keeps the bark straight before the cresting brine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now to the right, now to the other hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sped by the tempest, through the foaming main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vessel ran; she took the happy land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last nigh Rouen; and forthwith, in chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plate Astolpho cased, and girt with brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade put the saddle upon Rabicane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departed thence, and (what availed him more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than thousands armed) with him his bugle bore;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And traversing a forest, at the feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a fair hill, arrived beside a font,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the sheep foregoes his grassy meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Penned in the cabin or the hollow mount;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, overcome by feverish thirst and heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifted the weighty morion from his front;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tethered his courser in the thickest wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with intent to drink, approached the flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His lips he had not wetted in its bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before a youthful rustic, ambushed near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sprang from a copse, backed Rabican, and fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the good courser of the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho hears the noise and lifts his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when he sees his mighty loss so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Satiate, although he had not drunk, upstarts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after the young churl in fury darts.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That robber did not let the courser strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At speed, or he had from the warrior shot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But loosening now and tightening now the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fled at a gallop or a steady trot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the deep forest issued forth the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After long round, and reached in fine the spot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where so many illustrious lords were shent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worse prisoners they than if in prison pent!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On Rabican, who with the wind might race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The villain sped, within the enchanter’s won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impeded by his shield and iron case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Parforce Astolpho far behind him run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet there arrives as well, but every trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of what the warrior had pursued is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He neither Rabican nor thief can meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly rolls his eyes and plies his feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He plies his feet, and searches still in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout the house, hall, bower, or galleried rows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet labours evermore, with fruitless pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And care, to find the treacherous churl; nor knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he can have secreted Rabicane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who every other animal outgoes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly searches all day the dome about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above, below, within it, and without.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, wearied and confused with wandering wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perceived the place was by enchantment wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of the book he carried at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Logistilla given in India, thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bestowed, should new enchantment him betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That needful succour might therein be sought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to the index turns, and quickly sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What pages show the proper remedies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I’ the book, of that enchanted house at large</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was written, and in this was taught the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To foil the enchanter, and to set at large</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The different prisoners, subject to his sway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Of these illusions and these frauds in charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A spirit pent beneath the threshold lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the stone raised which kept him fast below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him the palace into smoke would go.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho with desire to bring to end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An enterprise so passing fair, delays</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more, but to the task his force does bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prove how much the heavy marble weighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As old Atlantes sees the knight intend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring to scorn his art and evil ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspicious of the ill which may ensue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He moves to assail him with enchantments new.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, with his spells and shapes of devilish kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes the duke different from his wont appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To one a giant, and to one a hind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To other an ill-visaged cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each, in the form which in the thicket blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The false enchanter wore, beholds the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they all, with purpose to have back</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What the magician took, the duke attack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Child,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-266" id="noteref-266" epub:type="noteref">266</a> Gradasso, Iroldo, Bradamant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prasildo, Brandimart, and many more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All, cheated by this new illusion, pant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay the English baron, angered sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he abased their pride and haughty vaunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who straight bethought him of the horn be bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for the succour of its echo dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, without fail, had laid Astolpho dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But he no sooner has the bugle wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And poured a horrid larum, than in guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of pigeons at the musquet’s scaring sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The troop of cavaliers affrighted flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less the necromancer starts astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less he from his den in panic hies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Troubled and pale, and hurrying evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till out of hearing of the horrid roar</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warder fled; with him his prisoned train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many steeds as well are fled and gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(These more than rope is needed to restrain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who after their astounded masters run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scared by the sound; nor cat nor mouse remain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seem to hear in it, “<em>Lay on, lay on.</em>”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rabican with the rest had broke his bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he fell into Astolpho’s hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, having chased the enchanter Moor away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upraised the heavy threshold from the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath which, figures and more matters lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I omit; desirous to confound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spell which did the magic dome upstay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The duke made havock of whate’er he found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As him the book he carried taught to do:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And into mist and smoke all past from view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There he found fastened by a golden chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s famous courser, <em>him</em> I say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Given by the wizard, that to the domain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of false Alcina him he might convey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On which, equipt with Logistilla’s rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To France Rogero had retraced his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had from Ind to England rounded all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The right-hand side of the terrestrial ball.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I know not if you recollect how tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a tree Rogero left his rein, the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Galaphron’s naked daughter from his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vanished, and him did with that scorn appay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser, to his wonder who espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned to him whom he was used to obey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the old enchanter’s care to dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stayed with him till broken was the spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At nought Astolpho could more joyous be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than this; of all things fortunate the best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the hippogryph so happily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Offered himself; that he might scower the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As much he coveted) of land and sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in few days the ample world invest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him well he knew, how fit for his behoof;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For of his feats he had elsewhere made proof.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him he that day in India proved, when sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was by sage Melissa, from the reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that ill woman who him, sore bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had changed from man to myrtle on the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had marked and noted how his giddy head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was formed by Logistilla to the rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw how well instructed by her care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero was, to guide him every where.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Minded to take the hippogryph, he flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The saddle on him, which lay near, and bitted</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The steed, by choosing, all the reins among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This part or that, until his mouth was fitted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in that place were many bridles hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Belonging to the coursers which flitted.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now alone, intent upon his flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thought of Rabicane detained the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Good cause he had to love that Rabicane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For better horse was not to run with lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him had he from the remotest reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of India ridden even into France:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After much thought, he to some friend would fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Present him, rather than so, left to chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandon there the courser, as a prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the first stranger who should pass that way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He stood upon the watch if he could view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some hunter in the forest, or some hind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom he might commit the charge, and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might to some city lead the horse behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He waited all that day and till the new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had dawned, when, while the twilight yet was blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thought he saw, as he expecting stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cavalier approaching through the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But it behoves that, ere the rest I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I Bradamant and good Rogero find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After the horn had ceased, and, far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous pair had left the dome behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero looked, and knew what till that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had seen not, by Atlantes rendered blind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atlantes had effected by his power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They should not know each other till that hour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero looks on Bradamant, and she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Looks on Rogero in profound surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for so many days that witchery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had so obscurred her altered mind and eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rejoiced, Rogero clasps his lady free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crimsoning with deeper than the rose’s dyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his fair love’s first blossoms, while he clips</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle damsel, gathers from her lips.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A thousand times they their embrace renew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And closely each is by the other prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While so delighted are those lovers two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their joys are ill contained within their breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluded by enchantments, much they rue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That while they were within the wizard’s rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They should not e’er have one another known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And have so many happy days foregone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The gentle Bradamant, who was i’ the vein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grant whatever prudent virgin might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To solace her desiring lover’s pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that her honour should receive no slight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“If the last fruits he of her love would gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor find her ever stubborn,” bade the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Her of Duke Aymon through fair mean demand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But be baptised before he claimed her hand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero good, who not alone to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Christian for the love of her were fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As his good sire had been, and anciently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His grandsire and his whole illustrious strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for her pleasure would immediately</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resign whatever did of life remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Says, “I not only, if ’tis thy desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will be baptised by water, but by fire.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then on his way to be baptised he hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might next espouse the martial may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Bradamant; who served him as a guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Vallombrosa’s fane,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-267" id="noteref-267" epub:type="noteref">267</a> an abbey gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rich, fair, nor less religious, and beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Courteous to whosoever passed that way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they encountered, issuing from the chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman, with a passing woful face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, as still courteous, still humane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To all, but woman most, when he discerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her dainty visage furrowed by a rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of lovely tears, sore pitied her, and burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the desire to know her grievous pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having to the mournful lady turned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besought her, after fair salute, to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What cause had made her eyes thus overflow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And she, uplifting their moist rays and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Most kindly to the inquiring Child replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of the cause of her unhappy plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, since he sought it, fully satisfied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thou hast to understand, O gentle knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My visage is so bathed with tears,” she cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“In pity to a youth condemned to die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This very day, within a town hard by.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Loving a gentle lady and a gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The daughter of Marsilius, king of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And feigning, veiled in feminine array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The modest roll of eye and girlish strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her each night the amorous stripling lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any had suspicion of the twain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But nought so hidden is, but searching eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the long run the secret will espy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One first perceived it, and then spoke with two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those two with more, till to the king ’twas said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom but yesterday a follower true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave order to surprise the pair in bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the citadel the prisoners mew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To separate dungeons in that fortress led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor think I that enough of day remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save the lover from his cruel pains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fled, not to behold such cruelty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For they alive the wretched youth will burn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor think I aught could more afflicting be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than such fair stripling’s torment to discern,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or that hereafter thing can pleasure me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much, but that it will to trouble turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If memory retrace the cruel flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which preyed upon his fair and dainty frame.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Touched deeply, Bradamant his danger hears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In heart sore troubled at the story shown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As anxious for the lover, it appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if he were a brother of her own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor certes wholly causeless are her fears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in an after-verse will be made known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, to Rogero; “Him to keep from harms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseems we worthily should turn our arms.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to that melancholy damsel said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Place us but once within the walls, and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the youth be not already dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will be your warrant that he shall not die.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, who the kindly bosom read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Bradamant, still full of piety,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Felt himself but all over with desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To snatch the unhappy stripling from the fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to the maid, whose troubled face apears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bathed with a briny flood, “Why wait we?⁠—need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is here of speedy succour, not of tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do you but where the youth is prisoned lead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from a thousand swords, a thousand spears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We vow to save; so it be done with speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But haste you, lest too tardy be our aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he be burnt, which succour is delayed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The haughty semblance and the lofty say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these, who with such wondrous daring glowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hope, which long had ceased to be her stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again upon the grieving dame bestowed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, for she less the distance of the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dreaded, than interruption of the road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest they, through this, should take that path in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel stood suspended and in pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said: “If to the place our journey lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the high road, which is both straight and plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we in time might reach it, I should say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the fire was lit; but we must strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By path so foul and crooked, that a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To reach the city would suffice with pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when, alas! we thither shall have sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I fear that we shall find the stripling dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And wherefore take we not the way most near?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero answers; and the dame replies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Because fast by where we our course should steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A castle of the Count of Poictiers lies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Pinnabel for dame and cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did, three days past, a shameful law devise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than whom more worthless living wight is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Count Anselmo d’Altaripa’s son.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No cavalier or lady by that rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without some noted scorn and injury goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both of their coursers here are dispossest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knight his arms and dame her gown foregoes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-268" id="noteref-268" epub:type="noteref">268</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No better cavaliers lay lance in rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor have for years in France against their foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than four, who for Sir Pinnabel have plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their promise to maintain the castle’s right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whence first arose the usage, which began</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But three days since, you now, sir knight, shall hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shall the cause, if right or evil, scan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which moved the banded cavaliers to swear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So ill a lady has the Castellan,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-269" id="noteref-269" epub:type="noteref">269</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wayward, that she is without a peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, on a day, as with the count she went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not whither, by a knight was shent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This knight, as flouted by that bonnibel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For carrying on his croup an ancient dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encountered with her champion Pinnabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of overweening pride and little fame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him he o’erturned, made alight as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put her to the proof, if sound or lame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Left her on foot, and had that woman old</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the dismounted damsel’s garment stoled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She, who remained on foot, in fell despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greedy of vengeance, and athirst for ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leagued with the faithless Pinnabel, a wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All evil prompt to further and fulfil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Says ‘she shall never rest by day nor night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever know a happy hour, until</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand knights and dames are dispossest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of courser, and of armour, and of vest.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Four puissant knights arrived that very day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It happened, at a place of his, and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had all of them from regions far away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come lately to those parts: so many true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And valiant warriors, skilled in martial play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our age has seen not. These the goodly crew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guido the savage, but a stripling yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon, and Aquilant, and Sansonet!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Them at the fortilage, of which I told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Pinnabel received with semblance fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next seized the ensuing night the warriors bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In bed, nor loosed, till he had made them swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That (he such period fixt) they in his hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should be his faithful champions for a year</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And month; and of his horse and arms deprive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever cavalier should there arrive.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And any damsel whom the stranger bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him, dismount, and strip her of her vest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, thus surprised, the warlike prisoners swore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So were constrained to observe the cruel hest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though grieved and troubled: nor against the four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems, can any joust, but vails his crest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knight infinite have come; but one and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afoot and without arms have left that Hall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Their order is, who from the castle hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first by lot, shall meet the foe alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if he find a champion of such guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As keeps the sell, while he himself is thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest must undertake the enterprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even to the death, against that single one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ranged in a band. If such each single knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imagine the assembled warriors’ might!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor stands it with our haste, which all delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All let forbids, that you beside that tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be forced to stop and mingle in the fray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For grant that you be conquerors in the stower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And as your presence warrants well, you may,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis not a thing concluded in an hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if all day he wait our succour, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much fear the stripling in the fire will die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Regard we not this hindrance of our quest,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero cried, “But do we what we may!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let <b>him</b> who rules the heavens ordain the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Fortune, if he leave it in her sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you shall by this joust be manifest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If we can aid the youth; for whom to-day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They on a ground so causeless and so slight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As you to us rehearsed, the fire will light.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero ceased; and in the nearest way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel put the pair without reply:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor these beyond three miles had fared, when they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reached bridge and gate, the place of forfeitry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of horse and arms and feminine array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With peril sore of life. On turret high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon first sight of them, a sentinel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beat twice upon the castle’s larum-bell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And lo, in eager hurry from the gate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An elder trotting on hackney made!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he approaching cried, “Await, await!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Hola! halt, sirs, for here a fine is paid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I to you the usage shall relate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this has not to you before been said.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the three forthwith began to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The use established there by Pinnabel.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He next proceeds, as he had wont before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To counsel other errant cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Unrobe the lady,” (said the elder hoar,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“My sons, and leave your steeds and martial gear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor put yourselves in peril, and with four</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such matchless champions hazard the career.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clothes, arms, and coursers every where are rife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not to be repaired is loss of life.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“⁠—No more!” (Rogero said) “No more! for I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am well informed of all, and hither speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the intention, here by proof to try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If, what my heart has vouched, I am in deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sign or threat I yield not panoply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If nought beside I hear, nor vest nor steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this my comrade, I as surely know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These for mere words as little will forego.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But let me face to face, by Heaven, espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those who would take my horse and arms away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For we have yet beyond that hill to hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And little time can here afford to stay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Behold the man,” that ancient made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Clear of the bridge!”⁠—Nor did in this missay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thence a warrior pricked, who, powdered o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With snowy flowers, a crimson surcoat wore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant for long time with earnest prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For courtesy the good Rogero prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To let her from his sell the warrior bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with white flowers had purfled o’er his vest.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But moved him not; and to Rogero’s share</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must leave, and do herself, what liked him best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He willed the whole emprize his own should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Bradamant should stand apart to see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The child demanded of that elder, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was he that from the gate first took his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, “ ’Tis Sansonet; of crimson hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know his surcoat, with white flowers gay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a word exchanged, the warlike two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divide the ground, and short is the delay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For they against each other, levelling low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their spears, and hurrying sore their coursers, go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while had issued from the fortress near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many footmen girt, Sir Pinnabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All ready to despoil the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in the warlike joust should void is sell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At one another spurred in bold career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knights, with their huge lances rested well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up to the points nigh equal was each stick,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of stubborn native oak, and two palms thick.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sansonet, of such staves, above five pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had made them sever from the living stock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In neighbouring wood, and bade his followers bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two of them hither, destined for that shock:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such truncheons to withstand, well needed were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A shield and cuirass of the diamond rock.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One he had made them give his foe, and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He kept himself, the present course to run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With these which might the solid anvil bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So well their ends were pointed) there and here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each aiming at the shield his foeman wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The puissant warriors shocked in mid career.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> of Rogero, wrought with magic lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By fiends, had little from the stroke to fear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of the buckler speak Atlantes made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whose rare virtues I whilere have said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I have already said, the enchanted light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strikes with such force on the beholder’s eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, at the shield’s discovery, every wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is blinded, or on earth half lifeless lies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherefore, well mantled with a veil, the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Keeps it, unless some passing need surprise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impassive is the shield as well believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since it no damage in the shock received.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other by less skilful artist wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did not so well that weightiest blow abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as if smit by thunder, in a thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave way before the steel, and opened wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave way before the griding steel, which sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The arm beneath, by this ill fortified:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that Sir Sansonet was smote, and reeled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his despite, unhorsed upon the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this was the first comrade of the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That of the tower maintained the usage fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who there had failed another’s spoil to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And voided in the joust his knightly sell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who laughs, as well will sometimes have to plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And find that Fortune will by fits rebel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew the warder on his larum beats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the other knights the sign repeats.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while Sir Pinabello had drawn near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Bradamant, and prayed that she would shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What warrior had his knight in the career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smith with such prowess.” That the guerdon due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his ill deeds might wait the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God’s justice that ill-doer thither drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the same courser, which before the Cheat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Bradamant had taken by deceit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas now exactly the eighth month was ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, if you recollect, upon his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faithless Maganzese, with whom she wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast into Merlin’s tomb the martial may;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When her a bough, which fell with her, defended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From death, or her good Fortune, rather say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Pinnabel bore off her courser brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming the damsel buried in the cave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The courser, and, through him, the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant knew to be the wicked Count,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having heard him, and perused him near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With more attentive eye and front to front⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“This is the man,” (the damsel said) “ ’tis clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who erst designed me outrage and affront.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! him the traitor’s sin doth hither speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all his treasons to receive the meed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To threaten him with vengeance, and to lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hands on her sword and charge him home, was done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All in a thought; but first she barred the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which he might his fortilage have won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To earth himself like fox, in his dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Pinnabel has every hope foregone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He screaming loud, nor ever making head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the damsel, through the forest fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pale and dismayed his spurs the caitiff plied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose last hope of escape in flight was found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with her ready sword, Dordona’s pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was at his flank, and prest him in his round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hunting him close and ever fast beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud is the uproar, and the woods resound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing of this is at the castle kenned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For only to Rogero all attend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other three, who from the fortress came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while had issued forth upon their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And brought with them the ill-accustomed dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who made wayfarers that ill use obey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all (who rather than prolong with blame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their life, would choose to perish in the fray)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The kindling visage burns, and heart is woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That to assail one man so many go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cruel courtezan by whom was made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by whose hest maintained, that evil rite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reminds the warriors that they are arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By oath and pact, to avenge her in the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If with this lance alone thy foes are laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth, why should I band with other knight?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Guido the savage said) “and if I lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Off with my head, for I consent to die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Aquilant; so Gryphon. For the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Singly against a single foe would run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rather would be taken, rather slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than he should be assailed by more than one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To them exclaimed the woman: “Why in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waste you so many words, where fruit is none?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I brought you here that champion’s arms to take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not other laws and other pacts to make.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You should have offered, when in prison cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This your excuse; which now too late is made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis yours the law’s observance to compel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not with lying tongue your oath evade.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“⁠—Behold! the arms; behold, with a new sell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cloth, the goodly steed!” Rogero said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Behold with these, as well, the damsel’s vest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If these you covet, why your course arrest?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She of the castle presses on <em>this</em> side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On <em>that</em> Rogero rates, and calls them on;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they parforce, t’wards him, together hied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But red with shame, are to the encounter gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foremost appeared ’mid those three knights of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Burgundy’s good marquis either son.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-270" id="noteref-270" epub:type="noteref">270</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Guido, who was borne on heavier steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came at some interval, with tardier speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the same lance with which he overbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Sansonet, Rogero came to fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well-covered with the shield which heretofore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atlantes used on Pyrenean height;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say the enchanted buckler, which, too sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For human sufferance, dazed the astonished sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To which Rogero, as a last resource,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the most pressing peril had recourse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Although three times alone the child was fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And, certes sore bested) this to display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twice when he from the wanton Fairy’s reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was to that soberer region on his way!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Last, when the unsated Orc upon the main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By this astounded, ’mid the sea-foam lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which would have fed upon the naked maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So cruel to the Child who brought her aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Save these three times, he has preserved the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath its veil, but covered in such wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it may quickly be to sight revealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he in need of its good succour lies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this, as said before, he came afield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As boldly, as if those three enemies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who were arrayed before him, had appeared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet less than little children to be feared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero shocked the valiant Gryphon, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The border of the buckler joined the sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seemed as he would fall, now here, now there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, from his courser far, last fell outright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>He</em> at the shield had aimed, but smote not fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mark; and (for Rogero’s orb was bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smooth) the hissing weapon slipt, and wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other effect than was in Gryphon’s thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It rent and tore the veil which served to hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lightning’s fearful and enchanted rays;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, without blinded eyes, can none abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upright, nor refuge is for them who gaze.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aquilant, who was at his brother’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tore off the rest, and made the buckler blaze:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The splendour struck the valiant brothers blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Guido in their rear, who spurred behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These here, or there, to earth astonished reel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor eyes alone are dazzled by the light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But every sense astounds the flaming steel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unconscious of the issue of the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero turned his horse, and, in the wheel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Handled his sword, so good to thrust and smite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And none descried his fury to oppose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in the charge dismounted were his foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The knights, together with the footmen all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And women, who had from the castle hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less the coursers panting with their fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if about to die, the warrior spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wondered first, and next perceived the pall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of silk was handing down on the left side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say the pall, in which he used to lap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shield, the evil cause of that mishap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He quickly turns, and, turning, rolls his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In hopes to view his well-loved martial maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thitherward, without delay, he hies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, when the joust began, the damsel stayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not finding her, it is the child’s surmise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she is gone to bear the stripling aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing he may be burnt, while they their journey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long delay, retarded by that tourney.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He saw the damsel, stretched among the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him had thither guided: as she lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took and placed her, yet with sleep opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before him, and, sore troubled, rode away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with a mantle, which above her vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wore, concealed the enchanted buckler’s ray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the maid restored, when ’twas concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her senses, which were ravished by the shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Away Rogero posted with the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And did not date his crimsoned visage raise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since every one, it seemed to him, might blame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With right that victory, worthy little praise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“By what amends can I of such a shame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The blushing warrior said) the stain eraze?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’twill be bruited, all my deeds by sleight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of magic have been done, and not by might.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As, thinking thus, he journeyed on his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero stumbled upon what he sought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, in the middle of the track, there lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A well, within the ground profoundly wrought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither the thirsty herd, at noon of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repaired, their paunches with green forage fraught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero said, “ ’Tis now, must I provide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shame from thee, O shield, no more abide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thee will I keep no more, and this shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even the last shame which so on me is thrown:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The child, so ending his self-colloquy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dismounting, takes a large and heavy stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the shield he ties, and bodily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both to the bottom of the well are gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Lie buried there for ever, from all eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with thee hidden be my shame!” he cries.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Filled to the brim with water was the well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heavy the stone, and heavy was the shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor stopt they till they to the bottom fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the light, liquid element concealed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fame was not slow the noble act to swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, wandering wide, the deed in brief revealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And voicing it abroad, with trumpet-sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told France and Spain and all the countries round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that so strange adventure to the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the wide world, from mouth to mouth was blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knights out of number undertook the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From neighbouring parts and distant; but unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To all remained the forest which possessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spring wherein the virtuous shield was thrown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she who told the action, would not say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where was the well, nor in what land it lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon Rogero’s parting thence, where fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The four good champions of that evil law,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made by the castle’s lord Sir Pinnabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him discomfited like men of straw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The shield withdrawn⁠—he had removed as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The light, which quelled <em>their</em> sight and minds who saw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those, who, like dead men, on earth had lain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had risen, full of wonderment, again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor any thing throughout that livelong day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They ’mid themselves but that strange case relate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how it was in that disastrous fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each by the horrid light was quelled, debate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While these, discoursing, of the adventure say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tidings are brought of Pinabello’s fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Pinnabel is dead the warriors hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But learn not who had slain the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant in close pass, this while, had staid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faithless Pinnabel, and sorely prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many times had buried half her blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within bleeding flanks and heaving breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When of his crimes the forfeit had been paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him, the infected country’s curse and pest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from the conscious forest turned away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that good steed the thief had made his prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She would return where she had left the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But never could make out the road anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now by valley, now by mountain-height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wandered well-nigh the ample country through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet could she never (such her fortune’s spite)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Find out the way to join Rogero true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him in another canto I attend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who loves the tale, to hear my story’s end.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Astolpho soars in air. Upon account</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Pinnabel is prisoned Scotland’s heir:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Roland freed, Frontino Rodomont</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Takes from Hippalca, trusted to her care.</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the fury falls, so strange and fell,</span>
					<br/>

			<p>
				<span>Let each assist the other in his need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seldom good actions go without their due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if their just reward should not succeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least, nor death, nor shame, nor loss ensue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who wrongs another, the remembered meed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well shall have, and soon or later rue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That “mountains never meet, but that men may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft encounter,” is an ancient say.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now mark what chanced to Pinnabel, the event</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of having borne himself so wickedly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He at the last received due punishment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Due and deserved by his iniquity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And God, who for the most is ill content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see the righteous suffer wrongfully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secured the maid from harm, and will secure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All who from every wickedness are pure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pinnabel deemed he to an end had brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And buried deep in earth, the martial maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor weening to behold her more, less thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her his treason’s forfeit to have paid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor profits it the wily traitor ought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be among the forts his father swayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Altaripa here its summit rears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid rude hills, confining on Poictiers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Anselm in Altaripa held command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The count from whom was sprung this evil seed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, to escape from angry Clermont’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of friends and of assistance stood in need.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At a hill’s foot, with her avenging brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant made the worthless traitor bleed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who found no better succour in the strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than piteous cry and fruitless prayer for life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she has put to death the treacherous peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to put her to death had erst intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek Rogero she again would steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that her cruel fate would not consent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, where the wood was loneliest and most drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wander by close path the lady sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the western sun withdrew his light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoning the world above to night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor knowing where for shelter she should rove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant in that place resolves to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Couched on the verdant herbage of the grove;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, sleeping, now awaits the dawn of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now watching Saturn, Venus, Mars, and Jove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the other wandering gods upon their way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, whether waking or to sleep resigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has aye Rogero present to her mind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With sorrow and repentance oft assailed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from her inmost heart profoundly sighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Anger over Love should have prevailed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Anger has torn me from my love,” (she cried,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Oh! had I made some note, which had availed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, whence I set out, my steps to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I departed on my ill emprize!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sure I was lorn of memory and of eyes!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These words and others she in mournful strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Utters, and broods within her heart on more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile a wind of sighs, and plenteous rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of tears, are tokens of her anguish sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the east, at last, expected long in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wished-for twilight streaked the horizon o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she her courser took, which on the ley</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was feeding, and rode forth to meet the day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor far had rode, ere from the greenwood-trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She issued, where the dome was erst displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many days her with such witcheries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The evil-minded wizard had delayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here she Astolpho found, who at full ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bridle for the Hippogryph had made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here was standing, thoughtful and in pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom he should deliver Rabicane.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By chance she found him, as the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had from the helm uncased his head to view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that when of the dingy forest clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair Bradamant her gentle cousin knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from afar she hailed with joyful cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now more nigh, to embrace the warrior flew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And named herself, and raised her vizor high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let him plainly who she was espy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None could Astolpho have found any where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom to leave his horse with more content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As knowing she would guard the steed with care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his lord on his return present;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he believed that Heaven had, in its care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Duke Aymon’s daughter for this pleasure sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her was he wont with pleasure aye to see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now with more in his necessity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Embracing twice or thrice the cousins stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fraternally, each other’s neck, and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had of each other’s welfare made demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With much affection, ere the duke ’gan say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Would I now see the winged people’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here upon earth I make too long delay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And opening to the dame the thought he brewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her the flying horse Astolpho shewed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But she scarce marvelled when above the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw the rising steed his wings unfold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since upon former time, with mastering rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him had charged the dame that wizard old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made her eye and eyelid sorely strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hard she gazed, his movements to behold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The day that he bore off, with wondrous range,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero on his journey, long and strange.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho says, “On her he will bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Rabican; so passing swift of kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if the courser started when a bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was drawn, he left the feathered shaft behind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will as well his panoply forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it may to Mount Alban be consigned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she for him preserve the martial weed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since of his arms he has no present need.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bent, since a course in air was to be flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, as best he can, will make him light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet keeps the sword and horn; although alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horn from every risk might shield the knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he the lance abandons, which the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Galaphron<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-271" id="noteref-271" epub:type="noteref">271</a> was wont to bear in fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lance, by which whoever in the course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was touched, fell headlong hurtling from his horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Backed by Astolpho, and ascending slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hippogryph through yielding aether flew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next the rider stirred the courser so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in a thought he vanished out of view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus with his pilot does the patron go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing the gale and rock, till he is through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The reefs; then, having left the shore behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoists every sail, and shoots before the wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant, when departed was the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remained distressed in mind; since in what way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She knew not her good kinsman’s warlike gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And courser to Mount Alban to convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For on her heart, which they inflame and tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warm desire and greedy will yet prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see the Child; whom she to find once more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Vallombrosa thought, if not before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here standing in suspense, by chance she spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A churl, that came towards her on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, at her hest, Astolpho’s armour tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As best he might, and laid on Rabicane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She next behind her bade the peasant guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(One courser loaded and one loose) the twain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two were the steeds; for she had <em>that</em> before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On which his horse from Pinnabel she bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Vallombrosa to direct her way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thought, in hopes to find Rogero there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, fearing evermore to go astray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew not how thither she might best repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The churl had of the country small assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, sure to be bewildered, wend the pair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet at a venture thitherward she hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she believes the place of meeting lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She here and there, as she her way pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned, but found none to question of the road;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw at mid-day, issuing from the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fort, nor far removed was the abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on the summit of a mountain stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the lady like Mount Alban showed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was Mount Alban sure; in which repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One of her brothers and her mother were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, when she recognized the place, became</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sadder at heart than I have power to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she delays, discovered is the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thence will be allowed to wend her way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thence she wends not, of the amorous flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which so consumes her, she will be the prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor see Rogero more, nor compass aught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which was at Vallombrosa to be wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some deal she doubted: then to turn her steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved upon Mount Alban’s castle near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for she thence her way could deftly read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her course anew towards the abbey steer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Fortune, good or evil, had decreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The maid, before she of the vale was clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of one of her good brethren should be spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alardo named, ere she had time to hide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He came from billeting the bands which lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispersed about that province, foot and horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the surrounding district, to obey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Charlemagne, had raised another force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embraces brotherly and friendly say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Salutes and kindly cheer, ensue of course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next into Mount Alban, side by side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, communing of many matters, ride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant enters Montalbano’s seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Beatrice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-272" id="noteref-272" epub:type="noteref">272</a> had mourned, and vainly sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through spacious France: ’Tis here all welcome sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The kiss and clasp of hand, she holds at nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While her a mother and a brother greet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the enamoured maid compares in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These with the loved Rogero’s fond embrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which time will never from her mind efface.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because <em>she</em> could not go, one in her stead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To send to Vallombrosa she devised,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thither in the damsel’s name should speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom should young Rogero be apprised</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What kept her thence; and prayed, if prayer should need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That there he for love would be baptised;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next, as was concerned, would intend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What might their bridal bring to happy end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She purposed the same messenger should bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well to her Rogero his good steed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he was ever wonted to hold dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthily dear; for sure so stout at need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And beauteous was no courser, far or near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In land of Christian or of Paynim creed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In occupation of the Gaul or Moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except Bayardo good and Brigliador.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valiant Rogero, when too bold of sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He backed the hippogryph and soared in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frontino left (Frontino he was hight),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Bradamant then took into her care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to Mount Alban sent; and had him dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nourished, at large cost, with plenteous fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let be rode except at easy pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence was he ne’er so sleek or well in case.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each damsel and each dame who her obeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She tasked, together with herself, to sew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With subtle toil; and with fine gold o’erlaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A piece of silk of white and sable hue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this she trapt the horse; then chose a maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Old Callitrephia’s daughter, from the crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose mother whilom Bradamant had nursed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A damsel she in all her secrets versed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How graven in her heart Rogero lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand times to her she had confessed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had extolled above the deities</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The manners, worth, and beauty be possessed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“No better messenger could I devise,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(She said, and called the damsel from the rest,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor have I one, Hippalca mine, more sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sure than three, to do my embassage.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hippalca was the attendant damsel hight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Go,” (says her lady, and describes the way)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards informs the maid aright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all which to Rogero she should say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And “why she at the abbey failed the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who must not to bad faith ascribe her stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this to Fortune charge, that so decides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, more than we ourselves, our conduct guides.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She made the damsel mount upon a pad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put into her hand Frontino’s rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if she met with one so rude or mad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to deprive her of the steed were fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Her to proclaim who was his owner,” bade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“As that which might suffice to make him sane.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she believed there was no cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that Rogero’s name would make him fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of many and many things, whereof to treat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With good Rogero, in her stead, she showed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of which instructed well, her palfrey fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippalca stirred, nor longer there abode.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through highway, field, and wood, a gloomy beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than ten weary miles the damsel rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere any crossed her path on mischief bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or even questioned witherward she went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At noon of day, descending from a mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in a streight and ill declivity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Led by a dwarf, encountered Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was afoot and harnessed cap-a-pee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moor towards her raised his haughty front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight blasphemed the eternal Hierarchy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That horse, so richly trapped and passing fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had not found in a knight-errant’s care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the first courser he should find, the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had sworn a solemn oath his hands to lay:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-273" id="noteref-273" epub:type="noteref">273</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This <em>was</em> the first, nor he on steed could light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fairer or fitter; yet to take away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The charger from a maid were foul despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doubtful he stands, but covets sore the prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eyes and surveys him, and says often, “Why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is not as well the courser’s master by?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! would be were!” to him the maid replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For haply he would make thee change thy thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A better knight than thee the horse doth ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly would his match on earth be sought.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Who tramples thus on other’s fame?”⁠—he cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she⁠—“Rogero”⁠—said, as she was taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then Rodomont⁠—“The steed I may my own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since him a champion rides of such renown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If he, as you relate, be of such force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he surprises all beside in might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I needs must pay the hire as well as horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be this at the pleasure of the knight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I am Rodomont, to him discourse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if indeed with me he lists to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me shall he find; in that I shine confest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By my own light, in motion or at rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I leave such vestige wheresoe’er I tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The volleyed thunder leaves not worse below.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had thrown back, over Frontino’s head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser’s gilded reins, in saying so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Backed him, and left Hippalca sore bested;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, bathed in tears, and goaded by her woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cries shame on him, and threats the king with ill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont hearkens not, and climbs the hill:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whither the dwarf conducts him on the trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Doralice and Mandricardo bold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind, Hippalca him in ceaseless chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursues with taunt and curses manifold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What came of this is said in other place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turpin, by whom this history is told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here makes digression, and returns again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where faithless Pinnabel was slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Duke Aymon’s daughter scarce had turned away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence, who on her track in haste had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere thither by another path, astray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino came, with that deceitful crone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw the bleeding body where it lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though the warrior was to him unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As good and courteous, felt his bosom swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pity at that cruel sight and fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dead lay Sir Pinnabel, and bathed in gore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whom such streams of blood profusely flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As were a cause for wonderment, had more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swords than a hundred joined to lay him low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A print of recent footsteps to explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier of Scotland was not slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who took the adventure, in the hope to read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was the doer of the murderous deed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hag to wait was ordered by the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would return to her in little space.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to the body of the count drew near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with fixt eye examined every place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who willed not aught, that in her sight was dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The body of the dead should vainly grace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one who, soiled with every other vice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surpassed all womankind in avarice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If she in any manner could have thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or hoped to have concealed the intended theft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bleeding warrior’s surcoat, richly wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would, together with his arms, have reft;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But at what might be safely hidden, caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, grieved at heart, forewent the glorious weft.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him of a beauteous girdle she undrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this secured between a double vest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino after some short space came back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who vainly Bradamant had thence pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the green holt; because the beaten track</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was lost in many others in the wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he (for daylight now began to lack)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feared night should catch him ’mid those mountains rude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the impious woman thence, in quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of inn, from the disastrous valley prest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A spacious town, which Altaripa hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Journeying the twain, at two miles’ distance spy:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There stopt the pair, and halted for the night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, at full soar, even now went up the sky:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor long had rested there ere, left and right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They from the people heard a mournful cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw fast tears from every eyelid fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if some cause of sorrow touched them all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino asked the occasion, and ’twas said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Tidings had been to Count Anselmo brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Pinnabel, his son, was lying dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a streight way between two mountains wrought.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino feigned surprise, and hung his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fear lest he the assassin should be thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But well divined this was the wight he found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his journey, lifeless on the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After some little time, the funeral bier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrives, ’mid torch and flambeau, where the cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are yet more thick, and to the starry sphere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lament and noise of smitten hands arise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And faster and from fuller vein the tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waters all cheeks, descending from the eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in a cloud more dismal than the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is the unhappy father’s visage drest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While solemn preparation so was made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the grand obsequies, with reverence due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">According to old use and honours paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In former age, corrupted by each new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A proclamation of their lord allayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly the noise of the lamenting crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Promising any one a mighty gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That should denounce by whom his son was slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From voice to voice, from one to other ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loud proclaim they through the town declare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till this the wicked woman chanced to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who past in rage the tiger or the bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence the ruin of the Scottish peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Either in hatred, would the crone prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or were it she alone might boast to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In human form, without humanity;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or were it but to gain the promised prize;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to seek out the grieving county flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, prefacing her tale in likely wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Said that Zerbino did the deed; and drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The girdle forth, to witness to her lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which straight the miserable father knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the woman’s tale and token built</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A clear assurance of Zerbino’s guilt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, weeping, with raised hands, was heard to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He for his murdered son would have amends.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To block the hostel where Zerbino lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all the town is risen, the father sends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prince, who deems his enemies away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And no such injury as this attends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his first sleep is seized by Anselm’s throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thinks he has endured so foul a wrong.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That night in prison, fettered with a pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of heavy letters, is Zerbino chained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For before yet the skies illuminated are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wrongful execution is ordained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the place will he be quartered, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The deed was done for which he is arraigned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other inquest is on this received;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is enough that so their lord believed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, the next morn, Aurora stains with dye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Red, white, and yellow, the clear horizon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people rise, to punish (“Death!” their cry)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino for the crime he has not done:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They without order him accompany,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lawless multitude, some ride, some run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the midst the Scottish prince, with drooping head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is, bound upon a little hackney, led.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But <b>he</b> who with the innocent oft sides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor those abandons who make him their stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For prince Zerbino such defence provides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is no fear that he will die to-day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God thitherward renowned Orlando guides;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose coming for his safety paves the way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando sees beneath him on a plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth to death conducted by the train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With him was wended she, that in the cell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prisoned, Orlando found; that royal maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Child of Gallicia’s king, fair Isabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom chance into the ruffians’ power conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time her ship she quitted, by the swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the wild sea and tempest overlaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel, who, yet nearer her heart-core</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than her own vital being, Zerbino wore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She had beneath Orlando’s convoy strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since rescued from the cave. When on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel saw the motley troop arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She asked Orlando what might be the train?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I know not,” said the Count; and left the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the height, and hurried towards the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He marked Zerbino, and at the first sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A baron of high worth esteemed the knight,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And asked him, “why and wherefore him they led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus captive,” to Zerbino drawing near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At this the doleful prince upraised his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having better heard the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rehearsed the truth; and this so well he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he deserved the succour of the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well Sir Orlando him, by his reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed innocent, and wrongly doomed to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, after he had heard ’twas at the hest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Anselm, Count of Altaripa, done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was certain ’twas and outrage manifest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since nought but ill could spring from him; and one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moreover, was the other’s foe profest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From ancient hate and enmity, which run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Clermont and Maganza’s blood; a feud</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With injuries, and death and shame pursued.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando to the rabble cried, “Untie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier, unless you would be slain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Who deals such mighty blows?”⁠—one made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That would be thought the truest of the train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Were he of fire who makes such bold defy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We wax or straw, too haughty were the strain:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And charged with that the paladin of France.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando at the losel couched his lance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The shining armour which the chief had rent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From young Zerbino but the night before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clothed himself withal, poor succour lent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against Orlando in that combat sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the churl’s right cheek the weapon went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It failed indeed his tempered helm to bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such a shock he suffered in the strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As broke his neck, and stretched him void of life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All at one course, of other of the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lance unmoved, he pierced the bosom through;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left it; on Durindana laid his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And broke into the thicket of the crew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One head in twain he severed with the brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(While, from the shoulders lopt, another flew)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many pierced the throat; and in a breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above a hundred broke and put to death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above a third he killed, and chased the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smote, and pierced, and cleft, as he pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself of helm or shield one dispossest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One with spontoon or bill the champaign strewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This one along the road, across it prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fourth; this squats in cavern or in wood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, without pity, on that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lets none escape whom he has power to slay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of a hundred men and twenty, in that crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So Turpin sums them) eighty died at least.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither Orlando finally withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, with a heart sore trembling in his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino sat; how he at Roland’s view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rejoiced, in verse can hardly be exprest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, but that he was on the hackney bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would at his feet have cast himself to ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Roland, after he had loosed the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Helped him to don his shining arms again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stript from those serjeants’ captain, who had dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself with the good harness, to his pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prince on Isabella turned his sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had halted on the hill above the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, after she perceived the strife was o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nearer the field of fight her beauties bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When young Zerbino at his side surveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady, who by him was held so dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous lady, whom false tongue had said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was drowned, so often wept with many a tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if ice at his heart-core had been laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waxed cold, and some deal shook the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the chill quickly past, and he, instead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was flushed with amorous fire, from foot to head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From quickly clipping her in his embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him reverence for Anglantes’ sovereign stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he thought, and held for certain case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Roland was a lover of the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So past from pain to pain; and little space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endured the joy which he at first assayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And worse he bore she should another’s be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than hearing that the maid was drowned at sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And worse he grieved, that she was with a knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom he owed so much: because to wrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady from his hand, was neither right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet perhaps would prove an easy quest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, without quarrel, had no other wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffered to part, of such a prize possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would endure, Orlando (such his debt)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A foot upon his prostrate neck should set.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The three in silence journey to a font,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where they alight, and halt beside the well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His helmet here undid the weary Count,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made the prince too quit the iron shell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth unhelmed, she sees her lover’s front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pale with sudden joy grows Isabel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, changing, brightened like a humid flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the warm sun succeeds to drenching shower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And without more delay or scruple, prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cast her arms about her lover dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not a word could draw-forth from her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bathed his neck and face with briny tear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, who remarked the love exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Needing no more to make the matter clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could not but, by these certain tokens, see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The could no other but Zerbino be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When speech returned, ere yet the maiden well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had dried her cheeks from the descending tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She only of the courtesy could tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Late shown her by Anglantes’ cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prince, who in one scale weighed Isabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together with his life, esteemed as dear⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell at Orlando’s feet and him adored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to two lives at once by him restored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Proffers and thanks had followed, with a round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of courtesies between the warlike pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had they not heard the covered paths resound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which overgrown with gloomy foliage were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon their heads the helmet, late unbound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They quickly place, and to their steeds repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, lo! a knight and maid arrive, ere well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavaliers are seated in the sell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was the Tartar Mandricardo, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In haste behind the paladin had sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To venge Alzirdo and Manilard, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom good Orlando’s valour had laid dead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though afterwards less eager to pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he with him fair Doralice had led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom from a hundred men, in plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, with a single staff of oak, had ta’en.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet knew not that it was Anglantes’ peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while, of whom he had pursued the beat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though that he was a puissant cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By certain signals was he taught to weet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than Zerbino him he eyed, and, near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perused the paladin from head to feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then finding all the tokens coincide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thou art the man I seek,” the paynim cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Tis now ten days,” to him the Tartar said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That thee I still have followed; so the fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had stung me, and in me such longing bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of thee to our camp of Paris came:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, amid thousands by thy hand laid dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce one alive fled thither, to proclaim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty havoc made by thy good hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid Tremisena’s and Noritia’s band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I was not, as I knew, in following slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both to behold thee, and to prove thy might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the surcoat o’er thine arms I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Instructed of thy vest) thou art the knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if such cognizance thou didst not show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ’mid a hundred, wert concealed from sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For what thou art thou plainly wouldst appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy worth conspicuous in thy haughty cheer.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No one can say,” to him Orlando cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But that a valiant cavalier thou art:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such a brave desire can ill reside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis my assurance, in a humble heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since thou wouldst see me, would that thou <em>inside</em>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Couldst as <em>without</em>, behold me! I apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will lay me helm, that in all points thy will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And purpose of thy quest I may fulfil.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But when thou well hast scanned me with thine eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that thine other wish as well attend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It yet remains for thee to satisfy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The want, which leads thee after me to wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou mayest mark if, in my valour, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agree with that bold cheer thou so commend.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“And now,” (exclaimed the Tartar), “for the rest!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For my first want is thoroughly redrest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando, all this while, from head to feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searches the paynim with inquiring eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both sides, and next the pommel of his seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surveys, yet neither mace nor tuck espies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And asks, “how he the combat will repeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If his good lance at the encounter flies.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Take thou no care for that,” replied the peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thus into many have I stricken fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I have an oath in Heaven to gird no blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till Durindana from the count be won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursuing whom, I through each road here strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him to reckon for more posts than one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou wilt please to hear, my oath I made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When on my head I placed this morion:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which casque, with all the other arms I bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand years ago great Hector’s were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To these good arms nought lacks beside the sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How it was stolen, to you I cannot say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This now, it seems, is borne by Brava’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence is he so daring in affray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet well I trust, if I the warrior board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make him render his ill-gotten prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet more; I seek the champion with desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To avenge the famous Agrican, my sire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Him this Orlando slew by treachery,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-274" id="noteref-274" epub:type="noteref">274</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I wot, nor could have slain in other wise.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The count could bear no more, and, “ ’Tis a lie!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Exclaims), “and whosoever says so, lies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him fairly did I slay; Orlando, I.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what thou seekest Fortune here supplies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And <em>this</em> the faulchion is, which thou has sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which shall be thine if by thy valour bought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Although mine is the faulchion, rightfully,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let us for it in courtesy contend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will I in this battle, that it be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More mine than thine, but to a tree suspend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bear off the weapon freely hence, if me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou kill or conquer.” As he made an end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He Durindana from his belt unslung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in mid-field upon a sapling hung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already distant half the range of bow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is from his opposite each puissant knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pricks against the other, nothing slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slack the reins or ply the rowels bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already dealt is either mighty blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the helm yields a passage to the sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if of ice, the shattered lances fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broke in a thousand pieces, to the sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One and the other lance parforce must split,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the cavaliers refuse to bend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavaliers, who in the saddle sit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning with the staff’s unbroken end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warriors, who with steed had ever smit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, as a pair of hinds in rage contend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the mead’s boundary or river’s right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed with two clubs, maintain a cruel fight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-275" id="noteref-275" epub:type="noteref">275</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The truncheons which the valiant champions bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fail in the combat, and few blows resist;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both rage with mightier fury, here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left without other weapon than the fist;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this the desperate foes engage, and, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hand can grapple, plate and mail untwist.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let none desire, to guard himself from wrongs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A heavier hammer or more holding tongs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How can the Saracen conclude the fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With honour, which he haughtily had sought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere forty to waste time in an assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where to himself more harm the smiter wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to the smitten: in conclusion, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Closed, and the paynim king Orlando caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strained against his bosom; what Jove’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did by Antaeus, thinking to have done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him griped athwart, he, in impetuous mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would now push from him, now would closely strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And waxed so wroth that, in his heat of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar little thought about his rein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm in his stirrups self-collected stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland, and watched his vantage to obtain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to the other courser’s forehead slipt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wary hand, and thence the bridle stript.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Saracen assays with all his might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To choke, and from the sell his foeman tear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With either knee Orlando grasps it tight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can the Tartar more him, here or there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with the straining of the paynim knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The girts which hold his saddle broken are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce conscious of his fall, Orlando lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With feet i’ the stirrups, tightening yet his thighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As falls a sack of armour, with such sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tumbled Orlando, when he prest the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Mandricardo’s courser, when he found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His head delivered from the guiding rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made off with him, unheeding what the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stumbling through woodland, or by pathway plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hither and tither, blinded by his fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bore with him the Tartar cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beauteous Doralice, who sees her guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So quit the field⁠—dismayed at his retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wonted in his succour to confide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hackney drives behind his courser fleet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim rates the charger, in his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smites him oftentimes with hands and feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threatening, as if he understood his lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where he’d stop the courser, chafes him more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not looking to his feet, by high or low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beast of craven kind, with headlong force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three miles in rings had gone, and more would go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that into a fosse which stopt their course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not lined with featherbed or quilt below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tumble, reversed, the rider and his horse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the hard ground was Mandricardo thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet neither spoiled himself, nor broke a bone:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here stopt the horse; but him he could not guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left without bit his motions to restrain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brimfull of rage and choler, at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar held him, grappled by the mane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Put upon him” (to Mandricardo cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lady, Doralice) “my hackney’s rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since for the bridle I have little use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For gentle is my palfrey, reined or loose.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The paynim deems it were discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To accept the proffer by the damsel made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But <em>his</em> through other means a rein will be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Fortune, who his wishes well appaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made thitherward the false Gabrina flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After she young Zerbino had betrayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who like a she-wolf fled, which, as she hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At distance hears the hounds and hunters’ cries.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She had upon her back the gallant gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the same youthful ornaments and vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stript from the ill-taught damsel for her jeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in her spoils the beldam might be drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rode the horse that damsel backed whilere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was among the choicest and the best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere yet aware of her, the ancient dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Doralice and Mandricardo came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stordilane’s daughter and the Tartar king</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laugh at the vest of youthful show and shape,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that ancient woman, figuring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like monkey, rather say, like grandam ape.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her the Saracen designs to wring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rein, and does the deed: upon the rape</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the crone’s bridle, he, with angry cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threatens and scares her horse, and makes him fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He flies and hurries through the forest gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ancient woman, almost dead with fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By hill and dale, by straight and crooked way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By fosse and cliff, at hazard, there and here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But it imports me not so much to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her, that I should leave Anglantes’ peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, from annoyance of a foe released,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The broken saddle at his ease re-pieced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He mounts his horse, and watches long, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departing, if the foe will reappear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor seeing puissant Mandricardo more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last resolves in search of him to steer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as one nurtured well in courtly lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence departed not the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he with kind salutes, in friendly strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair leaves had taken of the loving twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At his departure waxed Zerbino woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Isabella wept for sorrow: they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had wended with him, but the count, although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their company was fair and good, said nay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Urging for reason, “Nought so ill could show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In cavalier, as, when upon his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek his foeman out, to take a friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him with arms might succour or defend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next, if they met the Saracen, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They should encounter him, besought them say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he, Orlando, would for three days more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waiting him, in that territory stay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, after that, would seek the flags which bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The golden lilies, and King Charles’ array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Mandricardo through their means might know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If such his pleasure, where to find his foe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lovers promised willingly to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, and whatever else he should command.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By different ways the cavaliers withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One on the right, and one on the left hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The count, ere other path he would pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took from the sapling, and replaced, his brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, where he weened he might the paynim best</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encounter, thitherward his steed addrest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The course in pathless woods, which, without rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar’s charger had pursued astray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made Roland for two days, with fruitless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Follow him, without tidings of his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando reached a rill of crystal vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On either bank of which a meadow lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, stained with native hues and rich, he sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dotted o’er with fair and many trees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The mid-day fervour made the shelter sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hardy herd as well as naked swain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that Orlando, well beneath the heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some deal might wince, opprest with plate and chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He entered, for repose, the cool retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found it the abode of grief and pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And place of sojourn more accursed and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On that unhappy day, than tongue can tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Turning him round, he there, on many a tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld engraved, upon the woody shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What as the writing of his deity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knew, as soon as he had marked the lore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was a place of those described by me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither ofttimes, attended by Medore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the near shepherd’s cot had wont to stray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous lady, sovereign of Catày.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In a hundred knots, amid those green abodes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a hundred parts, their cyphered names are dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose many letters are so many goads,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Love has in his bleeding hear-core pight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would discredit in a thousand modes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That which he credits in his own despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would parforce persuade himself, <em>that</em> rhind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other Angelica than his had signed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And yet I know these characters,” he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Of which I have so many read and seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her may this Medoro be belied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And me, she, figured in the name, may mean.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feeding on such like phantasies, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The real truth, did sad Orlando lean</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the empty hope, though ill contented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he by self-illusions had fomented.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But stirred and aye rekindled it, the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he to quench the ill suspicion wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like the incautious bird, by fowler’s lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hampered in net or line; which, in the thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To free its tangled pinions and to soar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By struggling, is but more securely caught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando passes thither, where a mountain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erhangs in guise of arch the crystal fountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Splay-footed ivy, with its mantling spray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gadding vine, the cavern’s entry case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where often in the hottest noon of day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pair had rested, locked in fond embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the grotto, and without it, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had oftener than in any other place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With charcoal or with chalk their names portrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or flourished with the knife’s indenting blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here from his horse the sorrowing County lit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the entrance of the grot surveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cloud of words, which seemed but newly writ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which the young Medoro’s hand had made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the great pleasure he had known in it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sentence he in verses had arrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in his tongue, I deem, might make pretence</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To polished phrase; and such in ours the sense.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Gay plants, green herbage, rill of limpid vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, grateful with cool shade, thou gloomy cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where oft, by many wooed with fruitless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beauteous Angelica, the child of grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Galaphron, within my arms has lain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the convenient harbourage you gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, poor Medoro, can but in my lays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As recompence, for ever sing your praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And any loving lord devoutly pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Damsel and cavalier, and every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom choice or fortune hither shall convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stranger or native⁠—to this crystal run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shade, caverned rock, and grass, and plants, to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>Benignant be to you the fostering sun</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">
					<em>And moon, and may the choir of nymphs provide,</em>
				</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That never swain his flock may hither guide!</em>”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In Arabic was writ the blessing said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Known to Orlando like the Latin tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, versed in many languages, best read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in this speech; which oftentimes from wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And injury, and shame, had saved his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time he roved the Saracens among.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let him boast not of its former boot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erbalanced by the present bitter fruit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three times, and four, and six, the lines imprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the stone that wretch perused, in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeking another sense than was exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever saw the thing more clear and plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the while, within his troubled breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He felt an icy hand his heart-core strain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With mind and eyes close fastened on the block,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length he stood, not differing from the rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then well-nigh lost all feeling; so a prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wholly was he to that o’ermastering woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This is a pang, believe the experienced say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him who speaks, which does all griefs outgo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His pride had from his forehead passed away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His chin had fallen upon his breast below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor found he, so grief barred each natural vent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moisture for tears, or utterance for lament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stiffed within, the impetuous sorrow stays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which would too quickly issue; so to abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Water is seen, imprisoned in the vase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose neck is narrow and whose swell is wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time, when one turns up the inverted base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the mouth, so hastes the hurrying tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the streight encounters such a stop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It scarcely works a passage, drop by drop.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He somewhat to himself returned, and thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How possibly the thing might be untrue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The some one (so he hoped, desired, and sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To think) his lady would with shame pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or with such weight of jealously had wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whelm his reason, as should him undo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he, whosoe’er the thing had planned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had counterfeited passing well her hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With such vain hope he sought himself to cheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And manned some deal his spirits and awoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then prest the faithful Brigliadoro’s seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As on the sun’s retreat his sister broke.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor far the warrior had pursued his beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere eddying from a roof he saw the smoke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard noise of dog and kine, a farm espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thitherward in quest of lodging hied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Languid, he lit, and left his Brigliador</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a discreet attendant: one undrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His limbs, one doffed the golden spurs he wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one bore off, to clean, his iron vest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was the homestead where the young Medore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay wounded, and was here supremely blest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando here, with other food unfed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having supt full of sorrow, sought his bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The more the wretched sufferer seeks for ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He finds but so much more distress and pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who every where the loathed hand-writing sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On wall, and door, and window: he would fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Question his host of this, but holds his peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, in sooth, he dreads too clear, too plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make the thing, and this would rather shrowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it may less offend him, with a cloud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Little availed the count his self-deceit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For there was one who spake of it unsought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sheperd-swain, who to allay the heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which he saw his guest so troubled, thought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tale which he was wonted to repeat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Of the two lovers⁠—to each listener taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A history which many loved to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He now, without reserve, ’gan tell the peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How at Angelica’s persuasive prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to his farm had carried young Medore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grievously wounded with an arrow; where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In little space she healed the angry sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But while she exercised this pious care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love in her heart the lady wounded more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kindled from small spark so fierce a fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She burnt all over, restless with desire:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor thinking she of mightiest king was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who ruled in the east, nor of her heritage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forced by too puissant love, had thought no scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be the consort of a poor footpage.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—His story done, to them in proof was borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gem, which, in reward for harbourage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her extended in that kind abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, at parting, had bestowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A deadly axe was this unhappy close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, at a single stroke, lopt off the head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, satiate with innumerable blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cruel hangman Love his hate had fed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando studied to conceal his woes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet the mischief gathered force and spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would break out parforce in tears and sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would he, or would be not, from mouth and eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he can give the rein to raging woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone, by other’s presence unreprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his full eyes the tears descending flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a wide stream, and flood his troubled breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid sob and groan, he tosses to and fro</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About his weary bed, in search of rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly shifting, harder than a rock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sharper than a nettle found its flock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid the pressure of such cruel pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It past into the wretched sufferer’s head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That oft the ungrateful lady must have lain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together with her leman, on that bed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less he loathed the couch in his disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from the down upstarted with less dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than churl, who, when about to close his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Springs from the turf, if he a serpent spies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In him, forthwith, such deadly hatred breed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That bed, that house, that swain, he will not stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the morn break, or till the dawn succeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose twilight goes before approaching day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In haste, Orlando takes his arms and steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the deepest greenwood wends his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when assured that he is there alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gives utterance to his grief in shriek and groan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Never from tears, never from sorrowing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He paused; nor found he peace by night and day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fled from town, in forest harbouring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the open air on hard earth lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He marvelled at himself, how such a spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of water from his eyes could stream away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And breath was for so many sobs supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus ofttimes, amid his mourning, cried:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“These are no longer real tears which rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which I scatter from so full a vein.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-276" id="noteref-276" epub:type="noteref">276</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of tears my ceaseless sorrow lacked supplies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They stopt when to mid-height scarce rose my pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vital moisture rushing to my eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Driven by the fire within me, now would gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A vent; and it is this which I expend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which my sorrows and my life will end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No; these, which are the index of my woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These are not sighs, nor sighs are such; they fail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At times, and have their season of repose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I feel, my breast can never less exhale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its sorrow: Love, who with his pinions blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fire about my heart, creates this gale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love, by what miracle does thou contrive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It wastes not in the fire thou keep’st alive?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am not⁠—am not what I seem to sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What Roland was is dead and under ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slain by that most ungrateful lady’s spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose faithlessness inflicted such a wound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divided from the flesh, I am his sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in this hell, tormented, walks its round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be, but in its shadow left above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A warning to all such as thrust in love.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All night about the forest roved the count,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at the break of daily light, was brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By his unhappy fortune to the fount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where his inscription young Medoro wrought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see his wrongs inscribed upon that mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed his fury so, in him was nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But turned to hatred, frenzy, rage, and spite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor paused he more, but bared his faulchion bright;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cleft through the writing; and the solid block,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the sky, in tiny fragments sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wo worth each sapling and the caverned rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Medore and Angelica were read!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So scathed, that they to shepherd or to flock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thenceforth shall never furnish shade or bed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that sweet fountain, late so clear and pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From such tempestuous wrath was ill secure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he turf, stone, and trunk, and shoot, and lop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast without cease into the beauteous source;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till, turbid from the bottom to the top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never again was clear the troubled course.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length, for lack of breath, compelled to stop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(When he is bathed in sweat, and wasted force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serves not his fury more) he falls, and lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the mead, and, gazing upward, sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wearied and woe-begone, he fell to ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turned his eyes toward heaven; nor spake he aught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ate, nor slept, till in his daily round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The golden sun had broken thrice, and sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His rest anew; nor ever ceased his wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rankle, till it marred his sober thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length, impelled by frenzy, the fourth day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from his limbs tore plate and mail away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here was his helmet, there his shield bestowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms far off, and, farther than the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cuirass; through the greenwood wide was strowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All his good gear, in fine; and next his vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rent; and, in his fury, naked showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shaggy paunch, and all his back and breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ’gan that frenzy act, so passing dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of stranger folly never shall be said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So fierce his rage, so fierce his fury grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all obscured remained the warrior’s sprite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, for forgetfulness, his sword he drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or wonderous deeds, I trow, had wrought the knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither this, nor bill, nor axe to hew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was needed by Orlando’s peerless might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He of his prowess gave high proofs and full,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who a tall pine uprooted at a pull.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He many others, with as little let</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As fennel, wall-wort-stem, or dill, uptore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ilex, knotted oak, and fir upset,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And beech, and mountain-ash, and elm-tree hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He did what fowler, ere he spreads his net,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does, to prepare the champaigne for his lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By stubble, rush, and nettle-stalk; and broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like these, old sturdy trees and stems of oak.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The shepherd swains, who hear the tumult nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving their flocks beneath the greenwood tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some here some there across the forest hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hurry thither, all, the cause to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—But I have reached such point, my history,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I o’erpass this bound, may irksome be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I my story will delay to end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than by my tediousness offend.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Let him make haste his feet to disengage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lime his wings, whom Love has made a prize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For love, in fine, is nought but phrensied rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By universal suffrage of the wise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And albeit some may show themselves more sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Roland, they but sin in other guise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, what proves folly more than on this shelf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus, for another, to destroy oneself?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Various are love’s effects; but from one source</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All issue, though they lead a different way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is, as ’twere, a forest, where parforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who enter its recess go astray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here and there pursue their devious course:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sum, to you I, for conclusion, say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who grows old in love, besides all pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which waits such passion, well deserves a chain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One here may well reproach me: “Brother, thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seest not thy faults, while thou dost others fit.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—I answer that I see mine plain enow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“In this my lucid interval of wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strive and hope withal I shall forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This dance of folly; but yet cannot quit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As quickly as I would, the faults I own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For my disease has reached the very bone.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I in the other canto said before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, furious and insensate wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having torn off the arms and vest he wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cast away from him his faulchion bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And uptorn trees, and made the forest hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hollow cave resound, and rocky height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the noise some shepherds, on that side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their heavy sins or evil planets guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Viewing the madman’s wonderous feats more near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The frighted band of rustics turned and fled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But they, in their disorder, knew not where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As happens oftentimes in sudden dread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The madman in a thought is in their rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seizes a shepherd, and plucks off his head!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this as easily as one might take</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Apple from tree, or blossom from the brake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He by one leg the heavy trunk in air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upheaved, and made a mace the rest to bray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astounded, upon earth he stretched one pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who haply may awake at the last day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest, who well advised and nimble are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At once desert the field and scour away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor had the madman their pursuit deferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he not turned already on their herd.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By such examples warned, the rustic crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoned in the fields pick, scythe, and plough,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the roof of house and temple flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For ill secure was elm or willow’s bough,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From hence the maniac’s horrid rage they view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, dealing kick, and bite, and scratch, and blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Horses and oxen slew, his helpless prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well the courser ran who ’scaped that day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already might’st thou hear how loudly ring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hubbub and the din, from neighbouring farms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outcry and horn, and rustic trumpeting;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And faster sound of bells; with various arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By thousands, with spontoon, bow, spit, and sling,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! from the hills the rough militia swarms.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many peasants from the vale below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make rude war upon the madman go,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As beats the wave upon the salt-sea shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sportive at first, which southern wind has stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the next, bigger than what went before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bigger than the second, breaks the third;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the vext water waxes evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And louder on the beach the surf is heard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crowd, increasing so, the count assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drop from mountain and ascend from dale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Twice he ten peasants slaughtered in his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, charging him in disarray, were slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this experiment right clearly showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stand aloof was safest for the train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was none who from his body could draw blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For iron smote the impassive skin in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So had heaven’s King preserved the count from scathe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make him guardian of his holy faith.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He would have been in peril on that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he been made of vulnerable mould;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And might have learned was ’twas to cast away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sword, and, weaponless, so play the bold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rustic troop retreated from the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing no stroke upon the madman told.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since him no other enemy attends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando to a neighbouring township wends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since every one had left the place for dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No wight he found within it, small or great:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here was homely food in plenty spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victual, well sorting with the pastoral state.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, acorns undistinguishing from bread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-277" id="noteref-277" epub:type="noteref">277</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By tedious fast and fury driven to sate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hunger, he employed his hand and jaw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On what he first discovered, cooked or raw.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence, repossest with the desire to rove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, through the land, did man and beast pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scouring, in his frenzy, wood and grove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took sometimes goat or doe of dappled hue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often with bear and with wild boar he strove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with his naked hand the brutes o’erthrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gorging oftentimes the savage fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swallowed the prey with all its skin and hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now right, now left, he wandered, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout all France, and reached a bridge one day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath which ran an ample water’s tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of steep and broken banks: a turret gray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was builded by the spacious river’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discerned, from far and near, and every way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What here he did I shall relate elsewhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who first must make the Scottish prince my care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Roland had departed on his quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino paused some deal; then, in his rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slowly his steed by the same path addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had been taken by Anglantes’ peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor two miles on his way, I think, had prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he beheld a captive cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a sorry, little, hackney tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by armed horseman watched on either side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino speedily the prisoner knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Isabel, as soon; when nigh surveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was Sir Odoric, the Biscayan, who,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like wolf, the guardian of a lamb was made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom, of all his friends esteemed most true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino Isabella had conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping, one hitherto by him found just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would now, as ever, have approved his trust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even then how all had chanced, with punctual lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was Isabel relating to the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How in the pinnace she was saved, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The broken vessel sank at sea outright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Odoric’s assault; and next, how bandits bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to the cavern, in a mountain dight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Isabella yet her tale has told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When bound the malefactor they behold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The two that had Sir Odoric in their ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The royal damsel Isabella knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed he was her lover and her lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That pricked beside the lady, fair of hue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More; that the bearings on his shield record</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The honours of the stem from which he grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found, as better they observed his cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They had judged rightly of the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lighting, with open arms and hurried pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They make towards Zerbino eagerly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, kneeling, with bare head, the prince embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where lord is clipt by one of less degree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, looking either in the face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows one Corebo of Biscay to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Sir Almonio, his co-mate; the pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charged, under Odoric, with the galley’s care.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almonio cried, “Since God is pleased in the end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grammercy! Isabel should be with you;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My lord, I very clearly comprehend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should deliver tidings, nothing new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I should now inform you why I wend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this offender, whom with me you view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since she, who at his hands has suffered worst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The story of his crimes will have rehearsed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How me that traitor duped thou hast not to learn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time he rid himself of me, nor how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Corebo, who would have avenged the scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intended to the damsel, was laid low;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that which followed, upon my return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her unseen or heard, she cannot know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So as to thee the story to have told;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sequel of it then will I unfold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I seaward from the city, with a store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of nags, collected in a hurry, fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye watchful, if the trace I can explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those left far behind me; I repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thitherward; I arrive upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The place where they were left; look everywhere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sign of them perceive upon that strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except some steps, new-printed on the sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The steps I traced into the forest drear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor far within the greenwood had I wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, guided by a noise which smote my ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw my comrade bleeding on the ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Isabel I asked the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Odoric, and what hand had dealt his wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence departed, when the thing I knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeking the wretch these precipices through.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wide circling still I go, and through that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I find no other sign of him that fled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length return to where Corebo lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had the ground about him dyed so red,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, had I made little more delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A grave would have required, and, more than bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And succour of the leech, to make him sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Craved priest and friar to lay him in the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I had him to the neighbouring city brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And boarded with a friendly host; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Corebo’s cure in little time was wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath an old chirurgeon’s skilful care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This finished, having arms and horses brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We thence together to the court repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of King Alphonso of Biscay; where I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Find out the traitor, and to fight defy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The monarch’s justice, who fair field and free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Allowed us for the duel, and my right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Destiny to boot (for Destiny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oftener makes conquest where she listeth, light)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So backed my arms, <em>that</em> felon was by me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worsted, and made a prisoner in the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alphonso, having heard his guilt confessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade me dispose of him as liked me best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Him would I neither loose, nor yet have slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as thou seest, in bonds to thee convey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That whether he should be condemned to pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or death, it should be thine his doom to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, hearing thou wert with King Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, in hope to find thee, took my way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I thank my God, that thee upon this ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where I least hoped to meet thee, I have found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As well I render thanks, that Isabel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I see restored to thee, I know not how,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom, by reason of that traitor fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deemed thou never more should’st tidings know.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In silence prince Zerbino hears him tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His story, gazing upon Odoric’s brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pity, more than hate, as he perpends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How foully such a goodly friendship ends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After Almonio had his tale suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astounded for a while the prince stood by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wondering, that he who least should have offended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had him requited with such treachery:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, his long fit of admiration ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waking from his amazement with a sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Questioned the prisoner in the horsemen’s hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It that was true the cavalier had told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The faithless man alighted, and down fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his bended knees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-278" id="noteref-278" epub:type="noteref">278</a> and answered; “Sir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All people that on middle earth do dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through weakness of their nature, sin and err.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One thing alone distinguishes the well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And evil doer; <em>this</em>, at every stir</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of least desire, submits, without a blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> arms, but yields as well to stronger foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Had I been charged some castle to maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, without contest, on the first assault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoisted the banners of the hostile train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—For cowardice, or treason, fouler fault⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon my eyes (a well deserved pain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou might’st have justly closed the darksome vault;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, yielding to superior force, I read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should not merit blame, but praise and meed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The stronger is the enemy, the more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Easily is the vanquished side excused:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I could but faith maintain as, girded sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The leaguered fort to keep <em>her</em> faith is used;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even so, with all the sense, with all the lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By sovereign wisdom into me infused,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This I essayed to keep; but in the end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To o’ermastering assault was forced to bend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said Sir Odoric; and after showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Though ’twere too tedious to recount his suit)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him no light cause had stirred, but puissant goad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—If ever earnestness of prayer could boot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To melt a heart that with resentment glowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—If e’er humility produced good fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It well might here avail; since all that best</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moves a hard heart, Sir Odoric now exprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether or no to venge such infamy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Youthful Zerbino doubted: the review</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of faithless Odorico’s treachery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved him to death the felon to pursue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The recollection of the amity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long maintained between them, with the dew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of pity cooled the fury in his mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him to mercy towards the wretch inclined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While Scotland’s prince is doubting in such wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To keep him captive, or to loose his chain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or to remove him from before his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By dooming him to die, or live in pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud neighing, thitherward the palfrey hies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From which the Tartar king had stript the rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the old harridan, who had before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh caused Zerbino’s death, among them bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The horse, that had the others of that band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard at a distance, thither her conveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore weeping came the old woman, and demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For succour, in her trouble, vainly made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, when he saw her, raised his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To heaven, that had to him such grace displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Giving him to decide that couple’s fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The only two that had deserved his hate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wicked hag is kept, so bids the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he is determined what to do:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to cut off her nose and either ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now thought, and her as an example shew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, ’twere far better, deemed the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If to the vultures he her carcase threw:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He diverse punishments awhile revolved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus the warrior finally resolved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He to his comrades turned him round, and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To let the traitor live I am content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, if full grace he has not merited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet merits not to be so foully shent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, as I find his fault of Love was bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give him life and liberty consent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And easily we all excuses own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When on commanding Love the blame is thrown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Often has Love turned upside down a brain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sounder wit than <em>that</em> to him assigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And led to mischief of far deeper stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than has so outraged us. Let Odoric find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pardon his offences; <em>I</em> the pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these should justly suffer, who was blind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blind when I gave him such a trust, nor saw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How easily the fire consumes the straw.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then gazing upon Odoric, ’gan say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“This is the penance I enjoin to thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou a year shalt with the beldam stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever leave this while her company;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, roving or at rest, by night or day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shalt never for an hour without her be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her shall even unto death maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against whoever threatens her with pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will, if so this woman shall command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whosoe’er he be, thou battle do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will this while that thou all France’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From city shalt to city, wander through.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So says he: for as Odoric at his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well merits death, for his foul trespass due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This is a pitfall for his feet to shape,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which it will be rare fortune if he ’scape.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So many women, many men betrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wronged by her, have been so many more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not without strife by knight shall <em>he</em> be stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was beneath his care the beldam hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, for their crimes, shall both alike be paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>She</em> for her evil actions done before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And <em>he</em> who wrongfully shall her defraud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor far can go before he finds an end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To keep the pact Zerbino makes him swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mighty oath, under this penalty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That should he break his faith, and anywhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into his presence led by fortune be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more mercy, without time for prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cruel death shall wait him, as his fee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next by his comrades (so their lord commands)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Odoric is unpinioned from his bands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Corebo frees the traitor in the end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almonio yielding, yet as ill content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For much Zerbino’s mercies both offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which thus their so desired revenge prevent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence, he disloyal to his prince and friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In company with that curst woman went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What these befell Sir Turpin has not said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But more I once in other author read.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This author vouches (I declare not who)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That hence they had not one day’s journey wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Odoric, to all pact, all faith, untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For riddance of the pest to him commended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About Gabrina’s neck a halter threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left her to a neighbouring elm suspended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a year (the place he does not name)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almonio by the traitor did the same.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino, who the Paladin pursues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loath would be to lose the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his Scottish squadron of himself sends news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which for its captain well might stand in fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almonio sends, and many matters shews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too long at full to be recited here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almonio sends, Corebo next; nor stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other with him, besides the royal maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So mighty is the love Zerbino bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less than his the love which Isabel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nursed for the valorous Paladin, so sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>He</em> longed to know if that bold infidel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Count had found, who in the duel tore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from his horse, together with the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he to Charles’s camp, till the third day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be ended, will not measure back his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was the term for which Orlando said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should wait <em>him</em>, who yet no faulchion wears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is there place the Count has visited,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But thither in his search Zerbino fares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Last to those trees, upon whose bark was read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ungrateful lady’s writing, he repairs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little beside the road; and there finds all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In strange disorder, rock and water-fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Far off, he saw that something shining lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spied Orlando’s corslet on the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next his helm; but not that head-piece gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which whilom African Almontes crowned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in the thicket heard a courser neigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, lifting up his visage at the sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw Brigliadoro the green herbage browze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rein yet hanging at his saddle-bows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Durindane, he sought the greenwood, round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which separate from the scabbard met his view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next the surcoat, but in tatters, found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, in a hundred rags, the champaign strew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino and Isabel, in grief profound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood looking-on, nor what to think they knew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They of all matters else might think, besides</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fury which the wretched Count misguides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had but the lovers seen a drop of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They might have well believed Orlando dead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while the pair, beside the neighbouring flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld a shepherd coming, pale with dread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He just before, as on a rock he stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had seen the wretch’s fury; how he shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms about the forest, tore his clothes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slew hinds, and caused a thousand other woes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Questioned by good Zerbino, him the swain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all which there had chanced, informed aright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino marvelled, and believed with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although the proofs were clear: This as it might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from his horse dismounted on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full of compassion, in afflicted plight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And went about, collecting from the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The various relics which were scattered round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Isabel lights as well; and, where they lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispersed, the various arms uniting goes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! them a damsel joins, who frequent sigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaves from her heart, and doleful visage shows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If any ask me who the dame, and why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She mourns, and with such sorrow overflows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say ’twas Flordelice, who, bound in trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her lost lover’s footsteps, sought that place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her Brandimart had left disconsolate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without farewell, i’ the court of Charlemagne:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who there expected him six months or eight;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lastly, since he came not there again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From sea to sea, had sought her absent mate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through Alpine and through Pyrenean chain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In every place had sought the warrior, save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the palace of Atlantes’ grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If she had been in that enchanted hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She might before have seen the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wandering with Bradamant, Rogero bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso and Ferraù and Brava’s peer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-279" id="noteref-279" epub:type="noteref">279</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when Astolpho chased the wizard old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the loud bugle, horrible to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Paris he returned; but nought of this</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As yet was known to faithful Flordelice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Flordelice were known the arms and sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Who, as I say, by chance so joined the twain),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Brigliadoro, left without his lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet bearing at the saddle-bow his rein:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She with her eyes the unhappy signs explored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she had heard the tidings of the swain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had alike related, how he viewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando running frantic, in his mood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here prince Zerbino all the arms unites,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hangs, like a fair trophy, on a pine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to preserve them safe from errant knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Natives or foreigners, in one short line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the sapling’s verdant surface writes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>Orlando’s Arms, King Charles’s Paladine</b>.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he would say, “Let none this harness move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cannot with its lord his prowess prove!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino having done the pious deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is bowning him to climb his horse; when, lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar king arrives upon the mead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, at the trophied pine-tree’s gorgeous show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beseeches him the cause of this to read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lets him (as rehearsed) the story know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, without further pause, the paynim lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hastes gladly to the pine, and takes the sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“None can (he said) the action reprehend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor first I make the faulchion mine to-day;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-280" id="noteref-280" epub:type="noteref">280</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to its just possession I pretend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er I find it, be it where it may.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, this not daring to defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has feigned him mad, and cast the sword away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if the champion so excuse his shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This is no cause I should forego my claim.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Take it not thence,” to him Zerbino cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor think to make it thine without a fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If so thou tookest Hector’s arms of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By theft thou hadst them, rather than by right.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more parley spurred upon each side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well matched in soul and valour, either knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already echoed are a thousand blows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet well entered are the encountering foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In scaping Durindane, a flame in show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He shifts so quickly) is the Scottish lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He leaps about his courser like a doe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er the road best footing does afford.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well it is that he should not forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An inch of vantage; who, if once that sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smite him, will join the enamoured ghosts, which rove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the mazes of the myrtle grove.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the swift-footed dog, who does espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swine severed from his fellows, hunts him hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And circles round about; but he lies by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till once the restless foe neglect his guard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, while the sword descends, or hangs on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino stands, attentive how to ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How to save life and honour from surprise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And keeps a wary eye, and smites and flies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the other side, where’er the foe is seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To threaten stroke in vain, or make good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seems an Alpine wind, two hills between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the month of March shakes leafy wood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the ground now bends the forest green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now whirls the broken boughs, at random strewed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although the prince wards many, in the end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One mighty stroke he cannot scape or fend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the end he cannot scape one downright blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which enters, between sword and shield, his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As perfect was the plate and corslet, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thick was the steel wherein his paunch was drest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the destructive weapon, falling low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equally opened either iron vest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleft whate’er it swept in its descent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the saddle-bow, through cuirass, went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, but that somewhat short the blow descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It would Zerbino like a cane divide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him so little in the quick offends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This scarce beyond the skin is scarified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than a span in length the wound extends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of little depth: of blood a tepid tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his feet descending, with a crimson line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stains the bright arms which on the warrior shine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis so, I sometimes have been wont to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hand, more white than alabaster, part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The silver cloth, with ribbon red of hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hand I often feel divide my heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here little vantage young Zerbino drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From strength and greater daring, and from art;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in the temper of his arms and might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too much the Tartar king excelled the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fearful stroke was mightier in show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in effect, by which the Prince was prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that poor Isabel, distraught with woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Felt her heart severed in her frozen breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Scottish prince, all over in a glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With anger and resentment was possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And putting all his strength in either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote full the Tartar’s helmet with his brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almost on his steed’s neck the Tartar fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bent by the weighty blow Zerbino sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, had the helmet been unfenced by spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The biting faulchion would have cleft his head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king, without delay, avenged him well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor I for you till other season,” said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Will keep this gift;” and levelled at his crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping to part Zerbino to the chest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino, on the watch, whose eager eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waits on his wit, wheels quickly to the right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not withal so quickly, as to fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The trenchant sword, which smote the shield outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleft from top to bottom equally;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shearing the sleeve beneath it, and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote on his arm; and next the harness rended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And even to the champion’s thigh descended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Zerbino, here and there, seeks every way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which to wound, nor yet his end obtains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, while he smites upon that armour gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not even a feeble dint the coat retains.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the other hand, the Tartar in the fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such vantage o’er the Scottish prince obtains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him he has wounded in seven parts or eight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reft his shield and half his helmet’s plate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He ever wastes his blood; his energies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fail, though he feels it not, as ’twould appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unharmed, the vigorous heart new force supplies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the weak body of the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lady, during this, whose crimson dyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where chased by dread, to Doralice drew near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for the love of Heaven, the damsel wooed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stop that evil and disastrous feud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Doralice, who as courteous was as fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ill-assured withal, how it would end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Willingly granted Isabella’s prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight to truce and peace disposed her friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well Zerbino, by the other’s care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was brought his vengeful anger to suspend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, wending where she willed, the Scottish lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left unachieved the adventure of the sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fair Flordelice, who ill maintained descries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goodly sword of the unhappy count,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In secret garden, and so laments the prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foregone, she weeps for rage, and smite her front:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would move Brandimart to this emprize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, should she find him, and the fact recount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weens, for short season will the Tartar foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exulting in the ravished faulchion go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeking him morn and evening, but in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flordelice after Brandimart did fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And widely wandered from him, who again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already had to Paris made repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So far the damsel pricked by hill and plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She reached the passage of a river, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She saw the wretched count; but what befell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Scottish prince, Zerbino, let me tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For to leave Durindana such misdeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him appeared, it past all other woes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though he could hardly sit upon his steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though mighty loss of life-blood, which yet flows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, when his anger and his heat secede,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After short interval, his anguish grows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His anguish grows, with such impetuous pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He feels that life is ebbing from his veins.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For weakness can the prince no further hie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so beside a fount is forced to stay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him to assist the pitying maid would try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But knows not what to do, not what to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For lack of comfort she beholds him die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since every city is too far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where in this need she could resort to leech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose succour she might purchase or beseech.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, blaming Fortune, and the cruel sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can only utter fond complaints and vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Why sank I not in ocean,” (was her cry,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“When first I reared my sail upon the main?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, who on her his languid eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had fixt, as she bemoaned her, felt more pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that enduring and strong anguish bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through which the suffering youth was well-nigh dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So be thou pleased, my heart,” (Zerbino cried,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To love me yet, when I am dead and gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to abandon thee without a guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not to die, distresses me alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For did it me in place secure betide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To end my days, this earthly journey done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I cheerful, and content, and fully blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would die, since I should die upon thy breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But since to abandon thee, to whom a prize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not, my sad fate compels, I swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My Isabella, by that mouth, those eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By what enchained me first, that lovely hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My spirit, troubled and despairing, hies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into hell’s deep and gloomy bottom; where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To think, thou wert abandoned so by me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all its woes the heaviest pain will be.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-281" id="noteref-281" epub:type="noteref">281</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this the sorrowing Isabel, declining</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her mournful face, which with her tears o’erflows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the sufferer, and her mouth conjoining</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her Zerbino’s, languid as a rose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rose gathered out of season, and which, pining</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fades where it on the shadowy hedgerow grows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaims, “Without me think not so, my heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this your last, long, journey to depart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of this, my heart, conceive not any fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I will follow thee to heaven or hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It fits our souls together quit this sphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together go, for aye together dwell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sooner closed thine eyelids shall appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than either me internal grief will quell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, has it not such power, I here protest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I with this sword to-day will pierce my breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I of our bodies cherish hope not light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they shall have a happier fate when dead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together to entomb them, may some wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply by pity moved, be hither led.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She the poor remnants of his vital sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went on collecting, as these words she said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And while yet aught remains, with mournful lips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The last faint breath of life devoutly sips.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas here his feeble voice Zerbino manned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crying, “My deity, I beg and pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that love witnessed, when thy father’s land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou quittedst for my sake; and, if I may</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In any thing command thee, I command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, with God’s pleasure, thou live-out thy day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever banish from thy memory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, well as man can love, have I loved thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“God haply will provide thee with good aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To free thee from each churlish deed I fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As, when in the dark cavern thou wast stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sent, to rescue thee, Anglante’s peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So he (grammercy!) succoured thee dismayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At sea, and from the wicked Biscayneer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if thou must choose death, in place of worse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then only choose it, as a lesser curse.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think not these last words of Scotland’s knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were so exprest, that he was understood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these, he finished, like a feeble light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which needs supply of was, or other food.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Who is there, that has power to tell aright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle Isabella’s doleful mood?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When stiff, her loved Zerbino, with pale face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cold as ice, remained in her embrace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the ensanguined corse, in sorrow drowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel throws herself, in her despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shrieks so lout that wood and plain resound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many miles about; nor does she spare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bosom or cheek; but still, with cruel wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and the other smites the afflicted fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wrongs her curling lock of golden grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye calling on the well-loved youth in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She with such rage, such fury, was possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, in her transport, she Zerbino’s glaive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would easily have turned against her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill keeping the command her lover gave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that a hermit, from his neighbouring rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accustomed oft to seek the fountain-wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His flagon at the cooling stream to fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opposed him to the damsel’s evil will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The reverend father, who with natural sense</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abundant goodness happily combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with ensamples fraught and eloquence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was full of charity towards mankind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With efficacious reasons her did fence,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to endurance Isabel inclined;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Placing, from ancient Testament and new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Women, as in a mirror, for her view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The holy man next made the damsel see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That save in God there was no true content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And proved all other hope was transitory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fleeting, of little worth, and quickly spent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And urged withal so earnestly his plea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He changed her ill and obstinate intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made her, for the rest of life, desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To live devoted to her heavenly sire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not that she would her mighty love forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her dead lord, nor yet his relics slight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, did she halt or journey, every where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would Isabel have with her, day and night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hermit therefore seconding her care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, for his age, was sound and full of might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They on his mournful horse Zerbino placed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And traversed many a day that woodland waste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cautious elder would not bear away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus all alone with him that damsel bland</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where in a cave, concealed from day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His solitary cell hard by did stand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within himself exclaiming; “I convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With peril fire and fuel in one hand.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in such bold experiments the sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wisely would trust to prudence or to age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He thought to bear her to Provence, where, near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The city of Marseilles, a borough stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had a sumptuous monastery; here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of ladies was a holy sisterhood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, hither to transport the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They stowed his body in a chest of wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made in a town by the way-side; and which</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was long and roomy, and well closed with pitch.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, compassing a mighty round, they fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through wildest parts, for many and many a day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, the war extending every where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They seek to hide themselves as best they may:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length a cavalier arrests the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with foul scorn and outrage bars their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom you more in fitting time shall learn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to the Tartar king I now return.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the fight between the two<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-282" id="noteref-282" epub:type="noteref">282</a> was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already told by me, the king withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a cooling shade and river from the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His horse’s reins and saddle to undo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Letting the courser at his pleasure run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Browsing the tender grass the pasture through:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he reposed short time ere he descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An errant knight descend the mountain’s side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him Doralice, as soon as he his front</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplifted, knew; and showed him to her knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saying: “Behold! the haughty Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless the distance has deceived my sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To combat with thee, he descends the mount:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now it behoves thee put forth all thy might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lose me, his betrothed, a mighty cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch deems, and comes to venge his loss.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As a good hawk, who duck or woodcock shy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Partridge or pigeon, or such other prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing towards her from a distance fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raises her head, and shows her blithe and gay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Mandricardo, in security</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of crushing Rodomont in that affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gladly his courser seized, bestrode the seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reined him, and in the stirrups fixt his feet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the two hostile warriors were so near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That words could be exchanged between the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loudly began the monarch of Argier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To threat with head and hand, in haughty strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That to repentance he will bring the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lightly for a pleasure, rash and vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had scrupled not his anger to excite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who dearly will the offered scorn requite.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Mandricardo: “He but vainly tries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fright, who threatens <em>me</em>⁠—by words unscared.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Woman, or child, or him he terrifies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Witless of warfare; not me, who regard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With more delight than rest, which others prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stirring battle; and who am prepared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My foeman in the lists or field to meet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed or unarmed, on horse or on my feet.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They pass to outrage, shout, and ire, unsheath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brand; and loudly smites each cruel foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like winds, which scarce at first appear to breathe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next shake the oak and ash-tree as they blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to the skies upwhirl the dusty wreath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then level forests, and lay houses low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bear the storm abroad, o’er land and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which the flocks in greenwood-holt are slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of those two infidels, unmatched in worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant heart and strength, which thus exceed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To such a warfare and such blows give birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As suits with warrior of so bold a seed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the loud sound and horrid, trembles earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the swords cross; and to the stroke succeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quick sparks; or rather, flashing to the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bright flames by thousands and by thousands fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Without once gathering breath, without repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The champions one another still assail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Striving, now here, now there, with deadly blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rive the plate, or penetrate the mail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this one gains, nor the other ground foregoes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, as if girded in by fosse or pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, as too dearly sold they deem an inch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ne’er from their close and narrow circle flinch.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mid thousand blows, so, with two-handed swing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On his foe’s forehead smote the Tartar knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made him see, revolving in a ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myriads of fiery balls and sparks of light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The croupe, with head reversed, the Sarzan king</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now smote, as if deprived of all his might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stirrups lost; and in her sight, so well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beloved, appeared about to quit the sell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But as steel arbalest that’s loaded sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By how much is the engine charged and strained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By lever or by crane, with so much more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fury returns, its ancient bent regained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in discharging its destructive store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflicts worse evil than itself sustained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So rose that African with ready blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight with double force the stroke repaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont smites, and in the very place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where <em>he</em> was smit, the Tartar in return;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cannot wound the Sarzan in the face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because his Trojan arms the weapon turn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yes so astounds, he leaves him not in case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If it be morn or evening to discern.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont stopt not, but in fury sped</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A second blow, still aiming at his head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Mandricardo’s courser, who abhorred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The whistling of the steel which round him flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saved, with sore mischief to himself, his lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he backed the faulchion to eschew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aimed at his master, not at him, the sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote him across the head, and cleft it through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No Trojan helm defends the wretched horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like Mandricardo, and he dies parforce.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He falls, and Mandricardo on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more astound, slides down upon his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whirls his sword; to see his courser slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He storms all over fired with angry heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At him the Sarzan monarch drives amain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who stands as firm as rock which billows beat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so it happened, that the courser good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell in the charge, while fast the footman stood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The African, who feels his horse give way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stirrups quits, and lightly from the sell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is freed, and springs on earth: for the assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence matched anew, stands either infidel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worse than before the battle boils, while they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pride and anger, and with hatred swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About to close; but that, with flowing rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A messenger arrives to part the twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A messenger arrives, that from the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many others, news through France conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who word to simple knight and captain bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To join the troops, beneath their flags arrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he, the emperor, who the lilies wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Siege to their quarters had already laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, save quick succour thither was addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He read, their army’s scathe was manifest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Moorish messenger not only knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By ensigns and by vest, the warlike pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But by the circling blades, and furious blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which no other hands could wound the air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence dared not ’twixt champions interpose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deemed his orders an assurance were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From such impetuous fury, nor the saw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which says embassadors are safe by law:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But to fair Doralice approached, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Marsilius, Agramant, and Stordilane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within weak works, with scanty troops to aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were close beleaguered by the Christian train.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having told his tale, the damsel prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That this she to the warriors would explain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would accord the pair, and to their post</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispatch, for rescue of the Moorish host.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lady, with bold heart, ’twixt either foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threw herself, and exclaimed; “I you command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the large love you hear me, as I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you to better use reserve the brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that you instantly in succour go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of our host, menaced by the Christian band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which now, besieged within its camp, attends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ruin or speedy succour from its friends.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The messenger rehearsed, when she had done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fully the peril of the paynim train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said, “that he bore letters to the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Ulien, from the son of King Troyane.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The message ended, every grudge foregone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas finally resolved between the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They should conclude a truce, and till the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish siege was raised, their strife delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Intending, when from siege their Chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be relieved⁠—the one and the other knight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer to remain in company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bandy cruel war was with fell despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until determined by their arms shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom the royal dame belongs of right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, between whose hands their solemn troth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They plighted, was security for both.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-283" id="noteref-283" epub:type="noteref">283</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><b>Discord</b>, at hearing this, impatient grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With any truce or treaty ill content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that such fair agreement should ensue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>Pride</b>, who was present, could as ill consent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But <b>Love</b> was there, more puissant than the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equalled of none in lofty hardiment;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And launching from his bow his shafts of proof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these, made <b>Pride</b> and <b>Discord</b> stand aloof.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To keep the truce the rival warriors swore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since so it pleased her well, who either swayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One of their coursers lacked: for on the moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifeless King Mandricardo’s had been laid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, thither, in good time, came Brigliador,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, feeding, by the river’s margin strayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here I find me at my canto’s end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, with your licence, shall the tale suspend.</span>

					<span>Rogero Richardetto from the pains</span>

					<span class="i1">Of fire preserves, doomed by Marsilius dead:</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oh! mighty springs of war in youthful breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impetuous force of love, and thirst of praise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet which most avails is known aright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For each by turns its opposite outweighs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the bosom here of either knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Honour, be sure, and duty strongly sways:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the amorous strife between them is delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till to the Moorish camp they furnish aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet Love sways more; for, save that the command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was laid upon them by their lady gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither would in that battle sheathe the brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he was crowned with the victorious bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Agramant might vainly with his band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For either knight’s expected succour, stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then Love is not of evil nature still;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—He can at times do good, if often ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas now, suspending all their hostile rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and the other paynim cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish host from siege to disengage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Paris, with the gentle lady, steer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with them goes as well that dwarfish page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who tracked the footsteps of the Tartar peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he had brought the warrior front to front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In presence with the jealous Rodomont.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They at a mead arrived, where, in disport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knights were reposing by a stream, one pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disarmed, another casqued in martial sort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with them was a dame of visage fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these in other place I shall report,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not now; for first Rogero is my care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That good Rogero, who, as I have shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into a well the magic shield had thrown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He from that well a mile is hardly gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he a courier sees arrive at speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those dispatched by King Troyano’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To knights whom he awaited in his need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him Rogero hears that “so foredone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Charles are those who hold the paynim creed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They will, save quickly succoured in the strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As quickly forfeit liberty and life.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero stood awhile in pensive case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom many warring thoughts at once opprest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither fitted was the time nor place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make his choice, or judge what promised best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courier he dismist, and turned his face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither he with the damsel was addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom aye the Child so hurried on her way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He left her not a moment for delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pursuing thence their ancient road again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They reached a city, with the westering sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, in the midst of France, from Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marsilius had in that long warfare won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor them to interrupt or to detain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At drawbridge or at gate, was any one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though in the fosse, and round the palisade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood many men, and piles of arms were laid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because the troop about that fortress see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accompanying him, the well-known dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They to Rogero leave the passage free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even question him from whence he came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reaching the square, of evil company</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He finds it full, and bright with ruddy flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in the midst, is manifest to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth condemned, with face of pallid hue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As on the stripling’s face he turns his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which hangs declined and wet with frequent tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero thinks he Bradamant descries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much the youth resembles her in cheer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More sure the more intently he espies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her face and shape: when thus the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Or this is Bradamant, or I no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am the Rogero which I was before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She hath adventured with too daring will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In rescue of the youth condemned to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for the enterprise had ended ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hath there been taken, as I see. Ah! why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was she so hot her purpose to fulfil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she must hither unattended hie!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—But I thank Heaven, that hither have I made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I am yet in time to lend her aid.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He drew his falchion without more delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(His lance was broken at the other town),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-284" id="noteref-284" epub:type="noteref">284</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though the unarmed people making way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wounding flank, paunch, and bosom, bore them down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He whirled his weapon, and, amid the array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote some across the gullet, cheek, or crown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Screaming, the dissipated rabble fled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The most with cloven limbs or broken head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As while at feed, in full security,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A troop of fowl along the marish wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If suddenly a falcon from the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swoop mid the crowd, and one surprise and rend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest dispersing, leave their mate to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And only to their own escape attend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So scattering hadst thou seen the frighted throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When young Rogero pricked that crowd among.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero smites the head from six or four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in escaping from the field are slow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to the breast divides as many more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And countless to the eyes and teeth below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I grant no helmets on their heads they wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But there were shining iron caps enow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if fine helmets did their temples press,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sword would cut as deep, or little less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such good Rogero’s force and valour are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As never now-a-days in warrior dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet in rampant lion, nor in bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor (whether home or foreign) beast more fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply with him the earthquake might compare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or haply the great devil⁠—not he of hell⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he who is my lord’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-285" id="noteref-285" epub:type="noteref">285</a> who moves in fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And parts heaven, earth, and ocean in his ire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At every stroke he never less o’erthrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than one, and oftener two, upon the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And four, at once, and even five he slew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that a hundred in a thought were slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sword Rogero from his girdle drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As knife cuts curd, divides their plate and chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Falerina in Orgagna’s garden made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To deal Orlando death, that cruel blade.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-286" id="noteref-286" epub:type="noteref">286</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But to have forged that falchion sorely rued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who saw her garden wasted by the brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wreck, what ruin then must have ensued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From this when wielded by such warrior’s hand?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If e’er Rogero force, e’er fury shewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If e’er his mighty valour well was scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas here; ’twas here employed; ’twas here displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the desire to give his lady aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As hare from hound unslipt, that helpless train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defends itself against the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many lay dead upon the cumbered plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And numberless were they who fled in fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile the damsel had unloosed the chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the youth’s hands, and him in martial gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was hastening, with what speed she might, to deck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sword in hand and shield about his neck.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-287" id="noteref-287" epub:type="noteref">287</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, who was angered sore, as best he could,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought to avenge him of that evil crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave such signal proofs of hardihood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As stamped him for a warrior good and true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun already in the western flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had dipt his gilded wheels, what time the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Valiant Rogero and his young compeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victorious issued, of the city clear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When now Rogero and the stranger knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clear of the city-gates, the champaigne reach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth repays, with praises infinite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero in kind mode and cunning speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him, although unknown, had sought to right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At risk of life, and prays his name to teach</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he may know to whom his thanks he owed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such a mighty benefit bestowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The visage of Bradamant I see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous features and the beauteous cheer.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero said; “and yet the suavity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of her well-known accents do not hear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor such return of thanks appears to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In place towards her faithful cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if in very sooth it is the same,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How has the maid so soon forgot my name?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In wary wise, intent the truth to find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero said, “You have I seen elsewhere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And have again, and yet again, divined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet know I not, nor can remember where.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say it, yourself, if it returns to mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, I beseech, your name as well declare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which I would gladly hear, in the desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To know whom I have rescued from the fire.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“⁠—Me, it is possible you may have seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not when nor where (the youth replied);</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I too range the world, in armour sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeking adventure strange on every side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or haply it a sister may have been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to her waist the knightly sword has tied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Born with me at a birth; so like to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The family discerns not who is who.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You not first, second, or even fourth will be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who have in this their error had to learn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor father, brother, nor even mother me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her (such our resemblance) can discern.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis true, this hair, which short and loose you see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In many guise, and hers, with many a turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in long tresses wound about her brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wide difference made between us two till now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But since the day, that, wounded by a Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the head (a story tedious to recite)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A holy man, to heal the damsel’s sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cut short to the mid-ear her tresses bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excepting sex and name, there is no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One from the other to distinguish: hight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I Richardetto am, Bradamant she;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s brother and his sister we.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And to displease you were I not afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You with a wonder would I entertain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which chanced from my resemblance to the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begun in pleasure, finishing in pain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to whom nought more pleasing could be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to whose ears there was no sweeter strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That what in some sort on his lady ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besought the stripling so, that he began.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It so fell out, that as my sister through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The neighbouring wood pursued her path, a wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was dealt the damsel by a paynim crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which her by chance without a helmet found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she was fain to trim the locks which grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clustering about the gash, to maker her sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that ill cut which in her head she bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, shorn, she wandered through the forest hoar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ranging, she wandered to a shady font;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, worn and troubled, she, in weary wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lit from her courser and disarmed her front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, couched upon the greenwood, closed her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A tale more pleasing than what I recount</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In story there is none, I well surmise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither repaired young Flordespine of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in that wood was hunting with her train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, when she found my sister in the shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covered, except her face, with martial gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—In place of spindle, furnished with the blade⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed that she beheld a cavalier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The face and manly semblance she surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till conquered was her heart: with courteous cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wooed the maid to hunt with her, and past</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her alone into that hold at last.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When now she had her, fearless of surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safe in a solitary place, that dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By slow degrees, in words and amorous wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Showed her deep-wounded heart; with sighs of flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breathed from her inmost breast, with burning eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She spake her soul sick with desire; became</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now pale, now red; nor longer self-controlled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ravished a kiss, she waxed so passing bold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My sister was assured the huntress maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Falsely conceited her a man to be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in that need could she afford her aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found herself in sore perplexity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘ ’Tis better that I now dispel (she said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foolish thought she feeds, and that in me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel should a gentle woman scan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than take me for a craven man.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And she said well: for cravenhood it were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Befitting man of straw, not warrior true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom so bright a lady deigned to pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wonderous sweet and full of nectarous dew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To clack like a poor cuckoo to the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hanging his coward wing, when he should woo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shaping her speech to this in wary mode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My sister ‘that she was a damsel, showed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘That, like Camilla and like Hyppolite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought fame in battle-field, and near the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Afric, in Arzilla, saw the light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shield and spear enured from infancy.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A spark this quenched not; nor yet burned less bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The enamoured damsel’s kindled phantasy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too tardy came the salve to ease the smart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So deep had Love already driven his dart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor yet less fair to her my sister’s face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared, less fair her ways, less fair her guise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet the heart returned into its place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which joyed itself within those dear-loved eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flordespine deems the damsel’s iron case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her desire some hope of ease supplies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when she thinks she is indeed a maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laments and sobs, with mighty woe downweighed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He who had marked her sorrow and lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That day, himself had sorrowed with the fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘What pains (she said) did ever wight torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So cruel, but that mine more cruel were?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I need not to accomplish my intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other love, impure or pure, despair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rose I well might gather from the thorn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>My</em> longing only is of hope forlorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘If ’twas thy pleasure, Love, to have me shent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because by glad estate thine anger stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou with some torture might’st have been content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On other lovers used; but never word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have I found written of a female bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On love of female, mid mankind or herd.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Woman to woman’s beauty still is blind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ewe delights in ewe, nor hind in hind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘ ’Tis only I, on earth, in air, or sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who suffer at thy hands such cruel pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this thou hast ordained, that I may be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first and last example in thy reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foully did Ninus’ wife and impiously</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her own son a passion entertain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loved was Pasiphäe’s bull and Myrrha’s sire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But mine is madder than their worst desire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Here female upon male had set her will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had hope; and, as I hear, was satisfied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pasiphäe the wooden cow did fill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others, in other mode, their want supplied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, had he flown to me⁠—with all his skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dan Daedalus had not the noose untied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For one too diligent hath wreathed these strings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even Nature’s self, the puissantest of things.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So grieves the maid, so goads herself and wears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shows no haste her sorrowing to forego;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sometimes her face, sometimes her tresses tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And levels at herself the vengeful blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In pity, Bradamant the sorrow shares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is constrained to hear the tale of woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She studies to divert, with fruitless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The strange and mad desire; but speaks in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She, who requires assistance, not support,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still more laments herself, with grief opprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By this the waning day was growing short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the low sun was crimsoning the west;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fitting hour for those to seek a port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would not in the wood set up their rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to this city, near her sylvan haunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young Flordespine invited Bradament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My sister the request could ill deny;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so they came together to the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, but for you, by that ill squadron I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been compelled the cruel flame to face:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There Flordespina made her family</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Caress and do my sister no small grace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having in a female robe arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Past her on all beholders for a maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Because perceiving vantage there was none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the male cheer by which she was misled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel held it wise, reproach to shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which might by any carping tongue be said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this the rather: that the ill, which one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the two garments in her mind had bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now with the other which revealed the cheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would assay to drive from her conceit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The ladies share one common bed that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their bed the same, but different their repose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One sleeps, one groans and weeps in piteous plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because her wild desire more fiercely glows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on her wearied eyes should slumber light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All is deceitful that brief slumber shows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her it seems, as if relenting Heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A better sex to Bradamant is given.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As the sick man with burning thirst distrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he should sleep⁠—ere he that wish fulfil⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye in his troubled, interrupted, rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remembers him of every once-seen rill:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So is the damsel’s fancy still possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sleep, with images which glad her will.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then from the empty dreams which crowd her brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wakes, and, waking, finds the vision vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What vows she vowed, how oft that night she prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To all her gods and Mahound, in despair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That they, by open miracle, the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would change, and give her other sex to wear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all the lady’s vows were ill appaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply Heaven as well might mock the prayer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Night fades, and Phoebus raises from the main</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His yellow head, and lights the world again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On issuing from their bed when day is broken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wretched Flordespina’s woes augment:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For of departing Bradamant had spoken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anxious to scape from that embarrassment.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The princess a prime jennet, as a token,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forced on my parting sister, when she went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gilded housings, and a surcoat brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which her own hand had richly broidered, gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her Flordespine accompanied some way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, weeping, to her castle made return.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fast my sister pricked, she reached that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mount Alban; we who for her absence mourn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mother and brother, greet the martial may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her arrival with much joy discern:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For hearing nought, we feared that she was dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had remained in cruel doubt and dread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Unhelmed, we wondered at her hair, which passed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In braids about her brow, she whilom wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less we wondered at the foreign cast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the embroidered surcoat which she wore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she to us rehearsed, from first to last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The story I was telling you before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘How she was wounded in the wood, and how,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For cure, were shorn the tresses from her brow;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And next how came on her, with labour spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—As by the stream she slept⁠—that huntress bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how, with all her false semblance well content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from the train withdrew her out of sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor left she any thing of her lament</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Untold; which touched with pity every wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told how the maid had harboured her, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which past, till she revisited her Hall.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of Flordespine I knew: and I had seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Saragossa and in France the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whose bewitching eyes and lovely mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My youthful appetite had often strayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet her I would not make my fancy’s queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For hopeless love is but a dream and shade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now I this proffered in such substance view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Straitway the ancient flame breaks forth anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Love, with this hope, constructs his subtle ties;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who other threads for me would vainly weave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis thus he took me, and explained the guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which I might the long-sought boon achieve.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Easy it were the damsel to surprise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For as the likeness others could deceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which I to Bradamant, my sister, bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This haply might as well the maid ensnare.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-288" id="noteref-288" epub:type="noteref">288</a></span>

				<span class="i1">Aye to pursue whatever give delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I with no other of my plan devise,</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor any seek to counsel me aright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well knowing where the suit of armour lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My sister doffed, I thither go at night;</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor stand expecting until daylight break.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I rode all night⁠—Love served me as a guide⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek the home of beauteous Flordespine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there arrived, before in ocean’s tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The western sun had hid his orbit sheen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A happy man was he who fastest hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell my coming to the youthful queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Expecting from that lady, for his pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Favour and goodly guerdon to obtain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For Bradamant the guests mistake me all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—As you yourself but now⁠—so much the more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I have both the courser and the pall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which she left them but the day before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flordespine comes at little interval,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such festivity and courteous lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with a face, so jocund and so gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She could not, for her life, more joy display.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her beauteous arms about my neck she throws,</span>

				<span class="i1">If to my inmost heart the arrow goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Love directs, may well by you be wist,</span>

				<span class="i1">She leads me to her chamber of repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In haste, not suffers others to assist</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In taking off my panoply of steel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disarming me herself from head to heel.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then, ordering from her store a costly vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She spread it, and⁠—as I a woman were⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady me in that rich garment drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a golden net confined my hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I gravely moved my eyeballs, nor confest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By gesture or by look, the sex I bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My voice, which might discover the deceit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I tuned so well that none perceived the cheat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Next to the hall, where dame and cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In crowds are gathered, we united go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who make to us such court and goodly cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As men to queen or high-born lady show.</span>

				<span class="i1">Pien di sospiri e di querele gravi,</span>

				<span class="i1">E colli, e fianchi, e braccia, e gambe, e petti.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The thing remained concealed between us two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that our bliss endured some months; at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We were espied; and, as I sorely rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tidings to the Spanish monarch past.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou that whilere preserved’st me from the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which me into the flames designed to cast,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But God alone can read my sorrowing breast.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Richardetto spake, and by his say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made the dark path they trod less irksome be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up a small height this while their journey lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Girded with cliff and cavern, drear to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bristling with rocks, a steep and narrow way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was to that rugged hill the stubborn key;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A town, called Agrismonte, crowned the steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Aldigier of Clermont had in keep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bastard of Buovo, brother to the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Vivian and Sir Malagigi hight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him Gerardo’s lawful son declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are witnesses of little worth and light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—This, as it may!⁠—strong, valiant, wise, and ware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Liberal, humane, and courteous was the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the fortress of its absent lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By night and day, kept faithful watch and ward.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His cousin Richardetto, as behoved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was courteously received by Aldigier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him as dearly as a brother loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made Rogero for his sake good cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not with wonted welcome;⁠—inly moved⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He even wore a visage sad and drear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he, that day, ill-tidings had received,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence in heart and face the warrior grieved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Richardetto he exclaims, instead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of greeting; “Evil news are hither blown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By a sure messenger, to-day I read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That faithless Bertolagi of Bayonne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With barbarous Lanfusa has agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And costly spoils makes over to that crone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will consign to him the brethren twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy Malagigi and thy Viviane;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“These she, since Ferraù took them, aye has stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imprisoned in a dark and evil cell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the discourteous and foul pact was made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that false Maganzese of whom I tell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And them to-morrow, to a place conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt Bayonne and a town of his, will sell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him, who will be present, to advance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The price of the most precious blood in France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One, at a gallop, even now, to report</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tidings to our Rinaldo of the wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I sent; bur fear that he can ill resort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him in time, the journey is so long.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men have I not to sally from my fort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And my power halts where my desire is strong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The traitor will the knights, if rendered, slay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor know I what to do nor what to say.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Richardetto the ill news displease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (as they him) displease in equal wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero; who, when silent both he sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor able any counsel to devise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaims with mickle daring: “Be at ease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I challenge for myself the whole emprize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to set free your brethren, in my hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than a thousand shall avail this brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I ask not men, I ask not aid; my spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is, I believe, sufficient to the feat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I only ask of you a guide to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me to the place where for the exchange they meet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I even in this place will make you hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their cries, who for that evil bargain threat.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He said; nor to <em>one</em> listener of the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That had helped his actions, spake in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other heard him not, or heard at most</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As we great talkers hear, who little do:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Richardetto took aside their host</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told, “how him he from the fire withdrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he was assured, beyond his boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would in time and place his prowess shew.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas now that better audience than before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aldigier lent, and set by him great store;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And at the feast, where Plenty for the three</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Emptied her horn, him honoured as his lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here they conclude they can the brethren free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more succour from their gaoler’s ward.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while Sleep seized on lord and family,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save young Rogero: no repose afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the thoughts, which evermore molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, rankling in his bosom, banish rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The siege of Agramant, to him that day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told by the messenger, he has at heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He well discerns that every least delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will he dishonour. “What a ceaseless smart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will scorn inflict, what shame will him appay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he against his sovereign lord take part?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! what foul cowardice, how foul a crime</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His baptism will appear at such a time!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That true religion had the stripling swayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men might at any other time conceive:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now, when needed was the warrior’s aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From siege the Moorish monarch to relieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Fear and Baseness had more largely weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his designs, would every one believe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That any preference of a better creed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This thought makes good Rogero’s bosom bleed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor less to quit his Queen, her leave unsought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did with Rogero’s other griefs combine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now <em>this</em> and now <em>that</em> care upon him wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which diversely his doubtful heart incline:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unhappy lover fruitlessly had thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find her at the abode of Flordespine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither together went (as told whilere),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To succour Richardetto, maid and peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He next bethinks him of the promise plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To meet at Vallombrosa’s sanctuary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deems her gone thither, and that ’twill excite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her wonderment himself not there to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Could he at least a message send or write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he with reason might not censured be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because not only he had disobeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But was departing hence, and nothing said!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, having thought on many things, in the end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolves on writing what behoves; and, though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knows not how his letter he shall send,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the assurance it will safely go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This hinders not; he thinks that, as they wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chance in his way some faithful Post may throw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor more delays: up leaps the restless knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And calls for pen and paper, ink and light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That which is needed, in obedience meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aldigier’s valets bring, a careful band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth begins to write; and, first, to greet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The maid, as wonted courtesies demand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next tells, “how Agramant has sent to entreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his dispatches, succour at his hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, save he quickly to his comfort goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must needs be slain or taken by his foes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then adds, “his sovereign being so bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And praying him for succour in his pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She must perceive what blame upon his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would light, if Agramant applied in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, since with her he is about to wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis fitting he should keep him with stain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ill he deems a union could endure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between aught foul and her to passing pure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if he erst a name, renowned and clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had laboured to procure by actions fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having gained it thus, he held it dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—If this had sought to keep⁠—with greater care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He kept it now⁠—and with a miser’s fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guarded the treasure she with him would share;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, though distinct in body and in limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When wedded, ought to be one soul with him;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, as he erst by word, he now explained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew by writing, “that the period o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For which he was to serve his king constrained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless it were his lot to die before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would in deed a Christian be ordained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in resolve he had been evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of her kin, Rinaldo and her sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her afterwards in wedlock would require.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I would,’ he said, ‘relieve, with your good will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My king, besieged by Charlemagne’s array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the misjudging rabble, prone to ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might never, to my shame and scandal,’ say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, in fair wind and weather, still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waited upon his sovereign, night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now that Fortune to King Charles is fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has with that conquering lord his ensign spread.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fifteen days or twenty ask, that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet once again may to our army speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that, by me from leaguering enemy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The African cantonments may be freed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will some fit and just occasion spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, to justify my change of creed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I for my honour make this sole request;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then wholly yours for life, in all things, rest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero is such words his thoughts exposed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which never could by me be fully showed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And added more, nor from his task reposed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the crowded paper overflowed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He next the letter folded and enclosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sealed it, and within his bosom stowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In hopes to meet next morning by the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One who might covertly that writ convey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he had closed the sheet, that amorous knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His eyelids closed as well, and rest ensued:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Slumber came and steeped his wearied might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In balmy moisture, from a branch imbued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Lethe’s water; and he slept till⁠—white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And red⁠—a rain of flowers the horizon strewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Painting the joyous east with colours gay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from her golden dwelling broke the day:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when the greenwood birds ’gan, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greet the returning light with gladsome strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Aldigier (who wished to be the guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that journey, of the warlike twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would in succour of those brethren ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rescue them from Bertolagi’s chain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was first upon his feet; and either peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issues as well from bed, when him they hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When clad and thoroughly in arms arrayed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero with the cousins took his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having that pair already warmly prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The adventure on himself alone to lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But these, by love for those two brethren swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deeming it discourtesy to obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood out against his prayer, more stiff than stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would consent that he should wend alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>True to the time and place of change, they hie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither Sir Aldigier’s advices teach;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there survey an ample band who lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exposed to fierce Apollo’s heat; in reach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor myrtle-tree nor laurel they descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor tapering cypress, ash, nor spreading beech:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But naked gravel with low shrubs discerned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Undelved by mattock and by share unturned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those three adventurous warriors halted where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A path went through the uncultivated plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw a knight arrive upon the lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, flourished o’er with gold, wore plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on green field that beauteous bird and rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which longer than an age extends its reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more, my lord: for at my canto’s close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I find myself arrived, and crave repose.</span>

				<span>In former ages courteous ladies were,</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor with the avaricious many steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this frail life are worthy to be blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Held glorious and immortal when at rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant well would deathless praise inherit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who nor in wealth nor empire took delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in Rogero’s worth, excelling spirit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his unbounded gentlesse; and aright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this did good Duke Aymon’s daughter merit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be beloved of such a valorous knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, what might be for miracles received,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In future ages, for her sake achieved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, with those two of Clermont, as whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you I in the former canto said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say with Richardet and Aldigier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was gone, to give the prisoned brethren aid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I told, as well how they a cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of haughty look approaching had surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bore that noble bird, by fiery birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renewed, and ever single upon earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When those three of that warrior were espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poised on the wing, as if about to smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fain by proof their prowess would have tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if their semblance tallied with their might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Is there, among you, one,” the stranger cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Will prove upon me, which is best in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lance or sword, till one to ground be cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While in the sell his foe is seated fast?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“⁠—I, at your choice,” said Aldigier, “were fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To flourish faulchion, or to tilt with spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this with feat, which, if you here remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yourself may witness, so would interfere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for the present parley time with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffices, and yet less for the career.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six hundred men, or more, we here attend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom we must to-day in arms contend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Two of our own to rescue from their foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And free from chains, us Love and Pity sway.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to that stranger next the reason shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why thus in steel their bodies they array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“So just is the excuse which you oppose,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—He answered⁠—“that I ill should this gainsay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hold you surely for three cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That seldom upon earth will find their peers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With you a lance or two I would have crost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove how great your prowess in the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, since ’tis shown me at another’s cost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forego the joust, and to your reasons yield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Warmly I pray your leave against that host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To join with your good arms this helm and shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hope, if suffered of your band to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No worthless comrade shall you find in me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some one, meseems, may crave the stranger’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thus the champions on their road delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so to partnership in arms laid claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With those three warriors, for the strife arrayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>She</b>⁠—style no more a man that martial dame⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa was; that on Zerbino laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The task to bear about, against his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ribald Gabrina, prone to every ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The two of Clermont and their bold compeer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-295" id="noteref-295" epub:type="noteref">295</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gladly received her succour in their cause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom certes they believed a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not a damsel, and not what she was.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A banner was espied by Aldigier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shown the others, after little pause,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which by the wavering wind was blown about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And round about it ranged a numerous rout.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when, now nearer, the advancing crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were better marked in Moorish habit stoled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Saracens the stranger band they knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they upon two sorry jades behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the middle of that troop, the prisoners, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were to the false Maganza to be sold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa cries, “Why is the feast delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When lo! the guests are here, for whom we stayed?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“Not all,” Rogero said, “Of the array</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Invited, lacks as yet a numerous part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A solemn festival is held to-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we, to grace it more, use every art:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet they can now but little more delay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While thus they parley, they from other part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descry the treacherous Maganzese advance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So all was ready to begin the dance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They of Maganza from one quarter steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laden mules beneath their convoy go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bearing vest, gold, and other costly gear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the other side, mid faulchion, spear, and bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached the captive two with doleful cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who found themselves awaited by the foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And false and impious Bertolagi heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As with the Moorish captain he conferred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor Buovo’s nor Duke Aymon’s valiant son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-296" id="noteref-296" epub:type="noteref">296</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can hold, when that false Maganzese they view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against him both with rested lances run:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He falls the victim of those furious two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through belly and through pummel pierced by one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the other, in mid visage, through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bleeding cheeks: may like disastrous fate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erwhelm all evil doers, soon or late!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa with Rogero moved her horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At this, nor waited other trumpet-strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor broke her lance in her impetuous course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till in succession three had prest the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mark well worthy fierce Rogero’s force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim leader in a thought is slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with him, pierced by the same weapon, go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two others to the gloomy realms below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas hence a foul mistake the assaulted made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It caused their utter loss, and ruined all:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They of Maganza deemed themselves betrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the infidels, upon their leader’s fall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the other side, so charged with hostile blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moors those Maganzese assassins call;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with fierce slaughter, either angry horde</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Gan bend bow, and brandish lance and sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, charging this, or the other band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slays ten or twenty, shifting his career;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No fewer by the warlike damsel’s hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are slaughtered and extinguished, there and here:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many men as feel the murderous brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are from the saddle seen to disappear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before it vanish cuirass, helms and shields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the dry wood to fire in forest yields.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If ever you remember to have viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or heard⁠—what time the wasps divided are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the winged college is at feud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mustering their swarms for mischief in mid air⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greedy swallow swoop amid that brood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mangle and devour, and kill, and tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You must imagine so, on either part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bold Rogero and Marphisa dart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not so Sir Richardet and Aldigier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Varied the dance between those squadrons twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, heedless of the Moors, each cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had but an eye to false Maganza’s train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brother of Rinaldo, Charles’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much courage added to much might and main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these were now redoubled by the spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which against false Maganza warmed the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This cause made him who in his fury shared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good Buovo’s bastard, seems a lion fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, without pause, each trusty helmet pared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his good blade, or crushed it like the shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of brittle egg; and who would not have dared⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not have shown a Hector’s worth as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having two such companions in the stower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of warlike wights the very choice and flower?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, waging all the while the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her companions often turned to gaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as she marked their rivalry in might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Admiring, upon all bestowed her praise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when she on Rogero fixed her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed him unparalleled; and in amaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At times believed <em>that</em> Paladin was Mars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who left his heaven to mix in mortal wars.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She marvels at the champion’s horrid blows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She marvels how in vain they never fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The iron, smit by Balisarda shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like paper, not like stubborn plate and shell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pieces helm and solid corslet goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men are severed, even to the sell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom into equal parts those strokes divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Half dropt on this, and half on the other side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the same downright stroke, he overbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horse and rider, bleeding in the dust;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heads of others from their shoulders bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And parted from the hips the bleeding bust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He often at a blow cleft five and more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—but I doubt who hears me might distrust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What of a seeming falsehood bears the impress⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I would say more; but I parforce say less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Good Turpin, he who knows that he tells true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaves men to believe what they think right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Says of Rogero wondrous things, which you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing related, would as falsehoods slight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus, with Marphisa matched, that hostile crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appears like ice, and she like burning light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor her Rogero with less marvel eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she had marked his valour with surprise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As she had Mars in bold Rogero seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perhaps Bellona he had deemed the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If for a woman he had known that queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seemed the contrary, in arms arrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply emulation had between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pair ensued, by whom with cruel blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Most deadly signs of prowess should be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid that vile herd, on sinew, flesh and bone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To rout each hostile squadron, filled with dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sufficed the soul and valour of the four;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor better arms remained for them who fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the sharp goads which on their heels they wore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Happy was he with <em>courser</em> well bested!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By trot or amble they set little store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who had no steed, here learned, dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How wretched is the poor foot-soldier’s trade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The conqueror’s prize remained both field and prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was there footman left nor muleteer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moor took <em>this</em>, Maganza took <em>that</em> way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One leaves the prisoners, and one leaves the gear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With visage glad, and yet with heart more gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The four united each captive cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor were less diligent to free from chains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prisoned pages, and unload the wains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Besides good quantity of silver fine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wrought into different vessels, with a store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of feminine array, of fair design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embroidered round about with choicest lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And suit of Flemish tapestry, framed to line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Royal apartments, wrought with silk and ore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—They, ’mid more costly things in plenty spread⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discovered flasks of wine, and meat and bread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When now the conquering troop their temples bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All see they have received a damsel’s aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Known by her curling locks of golden hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And delicate and beauteous face displayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her the knights honoured much, and to declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her name, so well deserving glory, prayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor she, that ever was of courteous mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among her friends, their instances withstood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With viewing her they cannot sate their eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in the battle such had her espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She speaks but with the Child, but him descries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None prizes, values none, ’twould seem, beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile “that ready spread a banquet lies,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To them is by the servants notified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This they had served about a neighbouring fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Screened from the sun by an o’ershadowing mountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This spring was one of those four fountains rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those in France produced by Merlin’s sleight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encompassed round about with marble fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shining and polished, and then milk more white.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There in the stone choice figures chisseled were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that magician’s godlike labour dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save voice was wanting, these you might have thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were living and with nerve and spirit fraught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, to appearance, from the forest prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cruel Beast and hideous to the eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With teeth of wolf, an ass’s head and crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A carcass with long famine lean and dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lion’s claws; a fox in all the rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seemed to ravage France and Italy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Spain and England’s desolated strands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Europe and Asia, and in fine all lands.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-297" id="noteref-297" epub:type="noteref">297</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beast the low and those of proudest port</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had slain or maimed throughout this earthly ball;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, fiercest seemed on those of noble sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sovereign and satrap, prince and peer, to fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made most havoc in the Roman court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For it had slaughtered Pope and Cardinal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had filled <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s beauteous seat with scathe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And brought foul scandal on the <b>Holy Faith</b>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whate’er she touches, wall or rampire steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Goes to the ground; where’er the monster wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each fortress opens; neither castle-keep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor city from her rage its wealth defends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Honours divine as well that Beast would reap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems (while the besotted rabble bends)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And claim withal, as to its keeping given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sacred keys which open Hell and Heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Approaching next, is seen a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His temples circled with imperial bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three youths with him in company appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With golden lilies wrought in their array:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lion seems against that monster drear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To issue, with the same device as they:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The name of these are on the marble read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some on their skirt, some written overhead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of those who so against Beast advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One to the hilt has in his life-blood dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His faulchion, Francis styled the first of France;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Austrian Maximilian at his side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In one, who gores his gullet with the lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The emperor Charles the fifth is signified:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Henry the eighth of England is he hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in the monster’s breast a dart has pight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><b>The Tenth</b>, in writing, on his back displayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Lion, who that Beast is seen to hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By both his ears, and him so well has bayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thither troop assistants manifold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem the world all fear aside has laid;</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">Frontino, that good horse, by Rodomont:</span>

				<span class="i1">Him had she long pursued the former day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now with prayer, now followed with affront.</span>

				<span class="i1">To seek Rogero out in Agrismont;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, how I know not, heard upon her round,</span>

				<span>And, for to her well known was that repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Used by her often, she herself addrest</span>

				<span class="i1">Towards the fount, and in that quarter fair</span>

				<span class="i1">Better than was enjoined performs a hest,</span>

				<span class="i1">When Richardetto she beheld, made show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if she good Rogero did not know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She turned her wholly to Sir Richardet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As bound direct to him; and, on his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who well knew her, straight uprose and met,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And asked that damsel whitherward she hied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippalca, with her eyes yet red and wet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her long weeping, sighing deeply, cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cried aloud, that young Rogero, near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior she addrest, her tale might hear:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I from Mount Alban with a courser sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So your good sister had commanded me)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A horse much loved by her, and highly bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frontino is yclept that charger free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him I more than thirty miles had led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Marseilles, where she designed to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within few days; by her enjoined to wend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, and her arrival there attend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I in the sure belief pursued my course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was none so stout of heart, if I should say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Sir Rinaldo’s sister owned the horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would presume to take that steed away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But vain was my design; for him parforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Saracen took from me yesterday:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, when to him his master’s name I read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will that bold robber render back the steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Him I to-day and all the day before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have prayed, and prayer and menace proving vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye cursing him and execrating sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have left at little distance; where, with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both to his courser and himself, the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As best he can, a combat does maintain</span>

				<span class="i1">I trust my injury shall be redrest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this Rogero, leaping on his feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who scarcely had endured the whole to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Richardetto turned; and, as a meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guerdon for his good deed, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did, with beseechings infinite, entreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To let him singly with that damsel steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until she showed the paynim, who by force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had wrested from her hands that goodly horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Richardet (though it seems discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To yield to other champion that emprize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which by himself should terminated be)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet with Rogero’s earnest suit complies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who takes farewell of that good company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the damsel on her journey hies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaves those others, whom his feats confound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not merely lost in wonder, but astoud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him Hippalca said, when she apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had drawn him to some distance from the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“She was dispatched by her that in her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bore of his worth the image so imprest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And added, without using farther art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All that her lady had to him addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if she told another tale whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Richardetto she was then in fear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She added, “how the author of that deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had also said to her with mickle pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Because I know Rogero owns the steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More willingly I take him from his guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he would repossess the courser, read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him what I have no desire to hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am <em>that</em> Rodomont, whose martial worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatters its splendour through this ample earth.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Listening, the visage of the youthful knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Showed with what rage his heart was in a flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as that the horse was his delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well upon account of whence it came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And also that ’twas reft in his despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees dishonour will ensue and blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save he from Rodomont redeems the prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with a due revenge that wrong repay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With him, without repose, the damsel rides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with his foe would bring him front to front;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither journies where the road divides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one branch cuts the plain, one climbs the mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And either pathway to that valley guides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she had newly left King Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mountain track was short, but trod with pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other longer far, but smooth and plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hippalca’s ardour to retrieve the prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And upon Rodomont’s avenge the wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Incites that maid the mountain to assay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which (as said) the journey was less long:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Mandricardo, Rodomont, and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom I erst made mention in my song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That easier track across the level hold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus encounter not Rogero bold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until King Agramant shall succoured be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspended is their quarrel (in what wise</span>

				<span class="i1">You know), and in the champions’ company</span>

				<span class="i1">And, though the appearance of that maid was rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without her corslet, casque and all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—At their entreaty, these for once laid down⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She deigned to seem a maid and donned the gown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as Mandricardo saw her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In trust that, could he win her in affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would that maid, in recompense and place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Doralice, to Rodomont convey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if Love trafficked in such contracts base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lover could his lady change away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet with reason at the event be pained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he in losing one another gained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hence with a damsel to provide the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he himself the other may retain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming her worthy any cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would by force of arms the maid obtain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as if he could suddenly hold dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> maid as <em>that</em>, on him bestow the gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all of those, whom he about her spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith to joust and single fight defied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Vivian and Malagigi (who were dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms, as guard and surety for the rest,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and the other champion⁠—prompt for fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rose lightly from the herbage which they prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming they had to joust with either knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Rodomont, who came not on this quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No motion made as he a course would run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they had to tourney but with one.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Vivian is the first who moves his horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With mighty heart, and lays his weapon low;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, that Tartar king, renowned for force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With greater puissance meets the coming foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lance each warrior levels in the course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he bests trusts to plant the furious blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vainly Sir Vivian’s spear the casque offends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor throws that paynim knight, nor even bends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That Tartar’s harder weapon makes the shield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Vivian, at their onset, fly like grass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, tumbling from his saddle on the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extends the champion amid flowers and grass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To run his chance Sir Malagigi, steeled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did to his brother’s succour quickly pass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But (such that warrior’s hurry to be near)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather accompanied, than venged the peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The other of those brethren armed before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cousin, and had backed his courser wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having first defied, encountered sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spurring with flowing rein, the stranger knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the tempered helm that pagan wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounded the blow, an inch below the sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven-high the truncheon flew, in fragments broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the stout pagan winced not for the stroke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him on the left side smote that paynim peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (for the blow was with huge force designed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little his shield, and less his iron gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Availed, which opened like the yielding rhind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weapon pierced his shoulder; Aldigier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now right now left upon his horse inclined;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then him, ’mid grass and flowers, his comrades view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With arms of crimson, face of pallid, hue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next Richardetto comes, and for the blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intended, levels such a mighty lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He showed himself, as he was wont to show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy to be a paladin of France;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And has stamped signs of this upon the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he had warred on him with equal chance;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But prostrate rolled, encumbered by his steed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor fell the courser through his lord’s misdeed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When knight appeared not on the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who should in joust the paynim king affront,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thought the damsel was his prize, and hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where she was seated by the fount.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—“Lady, you are mine,” the Tartar cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Save other champion in your succour mount;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can you make denial or excuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since such the right of war and common use.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa raised her face with haughty cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And answered him; “Thy judgment wanders far;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will concede thy sentence would be clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concluding I am thine by right of war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If either were my lord or cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those, by thee unhorsed in bloody jar:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor theirs am I, nor other’s, but my own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who wins me, wins me from myself alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I too with lance and sword do doughty deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than one good knight on earth have laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Give me,” she cried, “my armour and my steed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And readily her squires that hest obeyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then in her waistcoat stood, of flowing weed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Despoiled, with well-knit from and charms displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in all points (such strength she shewed and grace)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resembled heavenly Mars, except her face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The damsel donned her sword, when armed all o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on her courser leapt with nimble spring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, right and left, she made him, thrice or more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poised on his haunches, turn in narrow ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, levelling the sturdy lance she bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defied, and next assailed, the Tartar king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So combating with Peleus’ son, of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Penthesilaea warred on Trojan shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like brittle crystal, in that proud career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weapons at the rest to pieces went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet neither of those warriors, ’twould appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Backwards one inch at their encounter bent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, who would willingly be clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What of a closer fight would be the event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For a new combat with the paynim lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheeled, to attack that warrior with the sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That Tartar cursed the elements and sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When her he saw remaining in her sell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, who thought to make his buckler fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cursed heaven as loudly as that infidel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already were their faulchions raised on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on the enchanted arms like hammers fell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enchanted arms both combatants enclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never more needed by those deadly foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So perfect are the champions’ plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They thrust or cut of spear or faulchion stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the two the battle might maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout this and throughout another day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Rodomont leaps in between the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And taxes Mandricardo with delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crying, “If battle here is to be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finish we that which we to-day begun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We made a truce, thou knowest, upon pact</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of furnishing our baffled forces aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor foe in joust or fight can be attacked</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By us with justice till this debt be paid.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to Marphisa he in reverent act</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Addressed himself, and of that courier said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next recounted to the martial dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How seeking aid for Agramant he came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next prays “not only with that Tartar knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She will abandon or defer the fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that, Troyano’s valiant son to right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She will, together with them, wend her way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which her warlike fame a higher flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More easily may, even to heaven, assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in a quarrel of such paltry guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which offers hindrance to such fair emprize.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, who had evermore in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove the paladins of Charles, and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To France was over land and ocean brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From clime so distant, with no other view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than by her own experience to be taught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If their far-spread renown were false or true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved together with the troop to speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as she had heard their monarch’s need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile Rogero, with that guiding may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had vainly by the rugged pathway sped:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who that king Rodomont another way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had taken, when he reached the mountain, read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thinking, that he was not far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the road straight towards that fountain led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trotting in haste behind the Sarzan hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he new prints upon the path espied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hippalca he to Mont Albano,” prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To wend, which distant one day’s journey lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because to seek anew that fountain-glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would be to wander in too wide a guise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that she need not doubt withal,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But that he would retrieve the ravished prize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, were she in Mount Alban⁠—or where’er⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vowed she the tidings speedily should hear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And gave the letter to that maid to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, writ by him, he in his bosom wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And added many matters, with the prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“She would excuse him by her friendly lore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippalca in her memory fixt, with care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The whole: took leave, and turned her horse once more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ceased that faithful messenger to ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till she Mount Alban reached at evening-tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero followed fast the paynim knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tracked o’er the level by those footsteps new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But overtook him not, till he got sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the fount, of Mandricardo too.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already either had his promise plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He nought unknown to his compeer would do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they had succour to that host conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On which King Charles his yoke had nearly laid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Arrived, Rogero knew Frontino gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, through that courser, knew the knight astride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on his lance with bending shoulder lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in fierce tone the African defied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Job was outdone by Rodomont that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the king subdued his haughty pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the fell fight which he had ever used</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek with every instance, he refused.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The first day this and last, that e’er in fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont refused his part to bear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his desire appeared to him so right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In succour of his sovereign to repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That if he had believed he clutched the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster than nimble leopard gripes the hare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He not so far his purpose would forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As on his prey to waste a passing blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Add, that he knows Rogero is the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who him for good Frontino now assails;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—So famous, that no other cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like him such eminence of glory scales;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The man, of whom he gladly would be clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By proof, how much in battle he avails;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet shuns the combat, proffered on his part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much his monarch’s siege has he at heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three hundred miles, a thousand, would he ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Were it not so⁠—to purchase such affray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, if him Achilles had defied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had done no otherwise than as I say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So deeply did the covering ashes hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fire beneath, whose fury stifled lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He told, “why he refused the strife;” and prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“As well Rogero the design to aid.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Adding, “that he, in doing so, would do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What to his lord a faithful vassal owes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still, when the siege was raised, might they renew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And terminate their deadly strife by blows.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him Rogero cried, “The fight with you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I freely will defer, till from his foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant be rescued by the sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Provided first Frontino be restored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Would you that I delay to prove by deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you have acted in unworthy sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nor did, like valiant man, to take my steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus from a woman⁠—till we meet at court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Render me my Frontino back, or read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon no other ground, will I support</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That battle shall not be between us two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will accord an hour of truce to you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While of that African he so demands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frontino, or him threats with instant fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And either still the other’s claim withstands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor <em>this</em> the steed will grant, nor <em>that</em> delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Mandricardo stirs, on the other hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another strife; who sees that ensign gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero on his shield was wont to wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bird which reigns o’er other fowls of air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He bore on azure field that eagle white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous ensign of the Trojan throng:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such glorious bearing showed that youthful knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he drew his line from Hector strong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Mandricardo knew not of this right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would endure⁠—and deemed a crying wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That any other but himself should wield</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Famed Hector’s argent eagle on his shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Mandricardo is like blazon wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bird of Ide, which bore off Ganymede:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How in the castle perilous of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gained that noble ensign for his meed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That enterprise I ween, with matter more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You bear in mind, and how, for his good deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fairy gave it him with all the gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erst given by Vulcan to the Trojan peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Tartar and Rogero had before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Engaged in battle, only on this quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divided by what accident, my lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Recites not, as already manifest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor had till now those knights encountered more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Mandricardo sees that bird imprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the Child’s shield, he shouts with threatening cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To young Rogero: “Take my proud defy!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Audacious man, mine ensign do’st thou wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this to-day for the first time, is said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And think’st thou, madman, I will thee forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because for once to spare thee I was led?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But since nor menace nor yet counsel are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of force to drive this folly from thy head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It shall appear how much it had been best</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thee forthwith to have obeyed my hest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As fire, whereon dry, heated wood is strown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roused by a little puff, at once ascends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So burns Rogero’s wrath, to fury blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the first word with which that king offends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thou thinkest,” he exclaims, “to bear me down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because his knight as well with me contends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But learn that I can win in fighting field</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him the horse, from thee good Hector’s shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet once before⁠—nor is it long ago⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twixt us in battle was this question tried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I that day restrained the murderous blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because thou hadst no faulchion at thy side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>These</em> shall be deeds, <em>that</em> strife was but a show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ill this argent bird shall thee betide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This is the ancient bearing of my line;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis thou usurpest what by right is mine.”</span>
			</p>

				<span>—“Say rather, thou usurpest mine from me;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cried Mandricardo; and that faulchion drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which lately, underneath the greenwood tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando from his hand in fury threw.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child, who could not aught but courteous be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such was his gentle nature) at the view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Mandricardo, with his faulchion drawn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let fall his ready lance upon the lawn;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And at the same time, strained his goodly sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better braced the covering shield he wore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ’twixt those combatants leapt Argier’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quick Marphisa spurred the pair before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one <em>this</em> foe, the other <em>that</em> implored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both besought, that they would strive no more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont complains, “The Tartar knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has violated twice the compact plight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“First, in belief he should Marphisa gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He more than once had jousted for that fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to bear off Rogero’s ensign fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He for king Agramant shows little care.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“If thus” (said Rodomont) “you faith maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To finish our own combat better were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cause of strife more fitting and more due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than either of the pleas maintained by you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On this condition was the treaty plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the accord between us now in force;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I with thee shall have performed the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I next shall answer him about the horse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You then with him, if you survive, your right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall to the shield maintain in warlike course.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I such work shall give you, I conceive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As will small labour for Rogero leave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“The bargain which thou hopest thou shalt not have,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(King Mandricardo answered Rodomont)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I will accord thee more than thou dost crave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And trust to make thee sweat from feet to front.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to bestow on others, much shall save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As water never fails in plenteous font;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for Rogero and a thousand more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the world beside reserve a store.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their fury waxed, and angrier words ensued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now upon <em>this</em> and now upon <em>that</em> side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Rodomont and with the Child at feud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fierce Mandricardo both at once defied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, not endowed with suffering mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would hear no more of peace, but vengeance cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now <em>here</em> Marphisa hurried, and now <em>there</em>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But could not singly such an ill repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As peasant, when a river saps its mounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seeking vent the oozing waters drop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hastening to shut the stream within its bounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And save his pastures and expected crop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dams right and left; yet him the stream confounds:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, if he <em>here</em> the sinking ruin prop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>There</em> he beholds the rotten dyke give out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from thick seams the restless water spout,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, while the Tartar and Rogero rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Rodomont, in hurly-burly fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For each of these would fiercest battle wage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would outgo his fears in that assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa seeks their fury to assuage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strives, and time and trouble throws away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For as she makes one knight from strife retire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She sees the others re-engage with ire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, to appease the warriors bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed, “Sirs, listen to my better lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A good remembrance ’tis, all argument</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave until we Agramant restore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If each is on his own design intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Mandricardo will I strive once more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fain would see, according to his word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he can conquer me with spear and sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But if, to aid our sovereign, duty call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him let us aid, nor civil discord breed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“To ground, through me, such project shall not fall,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero said, “so <em>he</em> restore my steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him resign that horse, or⁠—once for all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say again⁠—to his defence take heed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I either here my parting breath will yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or on my courser will return afield.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“ ’Twere not so easy to obtain this quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As ’twere that other,” Rodomont replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus pursued: “I unto thee protest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If any evil shall our king betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine is the fault not mine; for I am prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To do whate’er is fitting, on my side.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small heed to that protest Rogero paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stung by fury, griped his trenchant blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On Argier’s king he sprang, like savage boar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encountering him with shoulder and with shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him disordered and distrest so sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with one stirrup’s loss, the monarch reeled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Rogero,” Mandricardo cried, “give o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or else with me divide the battle-field;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And struck, this said, with worse than felon spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the morion of that youthful knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even to his courser’s neck Rogero bends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, when he would, himself can rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the sword of Ulien’s son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-316" id="noteref-316" epub:type="noteref">316</a> descends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well upon the youthful cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, but that adamant his face defends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across the cheeks his tempered helm would sheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child, in anguish, opens either hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this the bridle drops and that the brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him o’er the field his courser bears away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth the faulchion lies, which he let go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa (with Rogero’s through that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Comrade in arms) appeared like fire to glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enraged, that two one knight should overlay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as magnanimous and stout, for foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Singled King Mandricardo out, and sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all her might, stroke upon his head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont o’er the plain pursues his man.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Another stroke, and he has lost the horse!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Richardetto drives, and Vivian,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between the Child and paynim in that course.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> warrior at the king of Argier ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from Rogero severed him by force;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> (it was Vivian) in Rogero’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now from the blow recovered, placed his brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as to himself the Child returns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is by Vivian armed with sword again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To venge the injury that stripling burns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And runs at Rodomont with flowing rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like lion, whom a bull upon his horns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has lifted, though he feels this while no pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So him his heat of blood, disdain, and ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To venge that cruel outrage goad and fire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero storms upon the paynim’s crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, could that knight recover his own brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which by foul felony (as erst exprest)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ravished from the youthful warrior’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I well believe that the descending pest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont’s iron casque will ill withstand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That casque which Babel’s king bade forge, who sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To war on Heaven in his presumptuous thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discord, believing nothing could ensue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But stir, and strife, and combat on that head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that there was no place, amid the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For truce or treaty, to her sister said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That she, her well-beloved monks to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might now again with her securely tread.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let them depart; and mark we where in front</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero has sore wounded Rodomont.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero’s blow was levelled with such spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That this upon Frontino’s crupper made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The helmet and the shell of iron smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which that Saracen his limbs arrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, three times or four, to left and right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—As if about to fall⁠—head-foremost, swayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would have lost withal his trusty brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the hilt was fastened to his hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa has king Mandricardo prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, and makes him sweat breast, front, and face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he Marphisa has as sore distrest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such good plates each valiant bosom case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impassable is either iron vest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both have hitherto maintained their place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, at a turn her martial courser made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa needed young Rogero’s aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa’s martial steed, in turning short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where a firm footing that soft mead denied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the moist surface slipt, and in such sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he fell, helpless, on his better side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as he rose in haste and lacked support,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Athwart by furious Brigliador was plied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On which the paynim, little courteous, came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he fell anew beneath the dame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, when Marphisa on the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw unhorsed, deferred no more his aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for that deed had leisure; since, astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont far away had been conveyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He smote the morion which that Tartar crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, cleft like stalk, his head on earth had laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he his trusty Balisarda born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Mandricardo other helmet worn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont, of his senses repossest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned round this while, and Richardetto spied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And recollecting how, when late distrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to Rogero succour had supplied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly against that youthful warrior prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who an ill guerdon would from him abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did Malagigi not his malice thwart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other magic and with mickle art.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sage Malagigi versed in every sleight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which by the wisest wizard can be done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although his book he has not, by whose might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in his course can stop the passing sun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The conjuration recollects and rite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which he tames the rebel fiends; and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bids enter into Doralice’s steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he to fury stings and headlong speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Into that gentle palfrey’s form, who bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Vivian’s brother, simply by his lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made pass an angel of the dark domain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the good horse, who never moved before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except in due obedience to the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now took a leap, possest by that ill sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thirty feet long and sixteen feet in height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was a mighty leap, yet not so wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to make any rider void the sell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-317" id="noteref-317" epub:type="noteref">317</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing herself so high in air, loud cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Yielding herself for dead) that bonnibel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her palfrey, with the Daemon for his guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After his leap, runs, goaded by the spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The maid still screaming) such a furious course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An arrow had not reached the flying horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the first hearing of that voice, the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Ulien, on his part, the strife suspended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither, where the furious palfrey run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swiftly in succour of the lady wended.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less was by the Tartar monarch done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who neither Child nor damsel more offended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But without craving time, or truce, or peace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursued King Rodomont and Doralice.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa rose meanwhile, to fury stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with disdain all over in a glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought to accomplish her revenge, and erred:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For at too great a distance was the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, who beheld the war deferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather like lion roared than sighed: well know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those two their coursers they should vainly gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Following Frontino and good Brigliador.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero will not halt till he renew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And end the unfinished combat for the horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa will not quit that Tartar, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will to her satisfaction prove his force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave their quarrel in such guise the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteem foul scandal; as their better course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In chase of those offending knights to fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is the conclusion of that valiant pair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They in the paynim camp will find each foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If them before they find not on their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom thither bound, to raise the siege they know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere Charlemagne bring all beneath his sway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So thitherward the twain directly go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where these, they deem, will be their certain prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not so rudely thence Rogero broke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he first with his companion spoke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither returns Rogero, where apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is he, the brother of his lady fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vows himself his friend, with generous heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In good or evil fortune, everywhere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him he implores⁠—and frames his speech with art⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He his salutes will to his sister bear;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this so well; he moves by that request</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No doubt in him, nor any of the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Malagigi he and Viviane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next takes farewell and wounded Aldigier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their services no less that kindly twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proffer, as ever debtors to the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa to seek Paris is so fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That parting she forgets her friends to cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Malagigi and Vivian, in pursuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Follow, and from afar that maid salute;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so Sir Richardet as well: but low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth lies Aldigier, and there must rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The two first champions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-318" id="noteref-318" epub:type="noteref">318</a> towards Paris go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the two others<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-319" id="noteref-319" epub:type="noteref">319</a> next pursue that quest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other canto, Sir, I hope to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wondrous and of superhuman gest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wrought to the damage of the Christian king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By those two couples of whose worth I sing.</span>

				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>By good Rogero and those paynims three</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Defeated, Charlemagne to Paris flies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already all, throughout their chivalry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are mad with spite and hatred; jars arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strife; and means to still their enmity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their sovereign is unable to devise.</span>

					<span class="i1">From him departs the monarch of Argier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who is rejected of his lady dear.</span>

				<span>A woman for the most part reasons best</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a sudden motion, and untaught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For with that special grace the sex is blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid those so many gifts, wherewith ’tis fraught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But man, of a less nimble wit possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is ill at counsel, save, with sober thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ruminates thereon, content to spend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Care, time and trouble to mature his end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span><em>That</em> seemed good counsel, but was ill indeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Malagigi’s, as before was said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit he so rescued in his need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cousin Richardet, with odds o’erlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from the paynim monarchs him he freed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By ready demon, who his hest obeyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sure he never deemed they should be borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where they would work the Christian army scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had he some little prize for counsel stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(We with the same success may well suppose)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to his cousin might have furnished aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet brought not on the Christian host their foes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That evil sprite he might as well have made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, who embodied in the palfrey goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eastward or west, so far that lady bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That France should hear no further of the pair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So the two lovers, following her who flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To other place than Paris might be brought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this calamity was a surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Malagigi, through his little thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fiendish malice, banished from the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ever blood and fire and ravage sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guided them by that way to Charles’ disaster;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left to his choice by him, the wizard master.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wayward fiend who makes that palfrey ramp</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears off the frighted Doralice amain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor river nor yet yawning ditch, or swamp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wood, rock, or rugged cliff, the steed restrain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till, traversing the French and English camp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other squadrons of the mingled train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the holy flag of Christ arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to Granada’s king the fair conveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Sarzan and the Tartar the first day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That royal damsel a long while pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because her distant form they yet survey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But finally they lose that lady’s view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, like a lyme-dog, whom the hunters lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On hare or roebuck’s trail, the valiant two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Follow upon her track, nor halt, till told</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she is harboured in her father’s hold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Guard thyself, Charles: for, lo! against thee blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is such a storm, that I no refuge see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor these redoubted monarchs come alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But those of Sericane and Circassy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Fortune, who would probe thee to the bone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has taken those two shining stars from thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who kept thee by their wisdom and their light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou remainest blind and wrapt in night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis of the valiant cousins<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-320" id="noteref-320" epub:type="noteref">320</a> I would speak:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these, Orlando of his wit bereft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked, in sun or shower, by plain or peak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wanders about the world, a helpless weft;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, in wisdom little less to seek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, in thy peril thee has left;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for in Paris-town she is not found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In search of his Angelica is bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A cunning, old enchanter him deceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in the outlet of my tale was said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deluded by a phantom, he believed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica was with Orlando fled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence with jealousy, at heart, aggrieved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Lover ne’er suffered worse) to Paris sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence he, as soon as he appeared at court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By chance, was named to Britain to resort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now, the field won, wherein with mickle fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He drove King Agramant his works behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Paris yet again the warrior came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searched convent, tower, and house, and, save confined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt solid walls or columns be the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her will the restless lover surely find:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor her nor yet Orlando he descries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So forth in the desire to seek them hies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her to Anglantes or to Brava brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deemed the Count enjoyed in mirth and play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly, here and there, that damsel sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor here nor there, descried the long-sought prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Paris he repaired again, in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin returning to waylay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he deemed he could not rove at large</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without that Town, but on some special charge.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within he takes a day or two’s repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when he finds Orlando comes not there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again to Brava and Anglantes goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inquiring tidings of the royal fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, whether morning dawns or noontide glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nor night nor day⁠—his weary steed does spare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor once⁠—but twice a hundred times⁠—has run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The selfsame course, by light of moon or sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the ancient foe, deluded by whose say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the forbidden fruit Eve raised her hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned his wan eyes on Charlemagne one day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he the good Rinaldo absent scanned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seeing what foul rout and disarray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might at that time be given to Charles’s band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the Saracens the choice and flower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marshalled in arms against the Christian power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Sacripant and King Gradasso (who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whilere companionship in war had made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from Atlantes’ palace fled the two)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together to unite their arms, in aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of royal Agramant’s beleaguered crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the ruin of King Charles, he swayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where through unknown lands the warriors hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made smooth the way, and served them as a guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither another fiend that ruthless foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade Rodomont and Mandricardo bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through ways, by which his comrade was not slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the affrighted Doralice to fare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A third, lest they their enterprise forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero and Marphisa has in care:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But <em>their</em> conductor journeys not so fast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence that martial pair arrives the last.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Later by half an hour, against their foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So matched, Rogero and Marphisa speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the sable angel, who his blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aimed at the bands that held the Christian creed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Provided, that the contest which arose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About that horse, his work should not impede;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had again been kindled, had the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont and Rogero, met again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The first four ride until themselves they find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the besiegers and besieged they view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And see the banners shaking in the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the cantonments of those armies two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here they short counsel took, and next opined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In spite of Charlemagne’s beleaguering crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To carry speedy succour to their liege,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rescue royal Agramant from siege.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where thickest camped lay Charles’s host, they spurred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Closing their files against the Christian foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Afric and Spain!” is the assailants’ word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom at all points the Franks for paynims know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“To arms, to arms!” throughout their camp is heard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first is felt the Moorish sabre’s blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even on the rear-guard falls the vengeful stroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not charged alone, but routed, beat and broke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Christian host throughout is overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how they know not, in tumultuous wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that it is a wonted insult done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Switzer or by Gascon, some surmise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But⁠—since the reason is to most unknown⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each several nation to its standard flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This to the drum, that to the trumpet’s sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shriek and shout from earth to heaven redound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All armed is Charlemagne, except his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, girt with paladins, his faithful stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived demanding what alarm has bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disorder in his host and disarray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stopt with menace this or that who fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many fugitives, upon their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some with maimed face, breast, arm, or hand, espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And some with head or throat with life-blood dyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Advancing, he on earth saw many more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or rather in a lake of crimson laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Horribly weltering in their own dark gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the leech’s and magician’s aid;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-321" id="noteref-321" epub:type="noteref">321</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And busts dissevered from the heads they bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And legs and arms⁠—a cruel show⁠—surveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, from the first cantonments to the last,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw slaughtered men on all sides as he past.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where the small band advances in such wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserving well eternal praise to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vouching their deeds, a long-drawn furrow lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A signal record of their might and main.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His army’s cruel slaughter, with surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anger and rage, is viewed by Charlemagne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So he whose shattered walls have felt its force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout his mansion tracks the lightning’s course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not to the ramparts of the paynim crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Agramant as yet had pierced this aid,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-322" id="noteref-322" epub:type="noteref">322</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, on the further side, these other two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero and Marphisa, thither made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, once or twice, that worthy pair a view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have taken of the ground, and have surveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The readiest way assistance to afford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They swiftly move in succour of their lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when we spark to loaded mine apply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the long furrow, filled with sable grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fast the furious wildfire darts, that eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pursues the progress of the flash with pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as dire ruin follows, and from high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loosened rock and solid bastion rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So bold Rogero and Marphisa rush</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To battle, so the Christian squadrons crush.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Front and askance, the assailants smote, and low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth heads, arms, and severed shoulders lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er the Christian squadrons were too slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To free the path and break their close array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whoe’er has seen the passing tempest blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of the hill or valley, in its way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One portion ravage and another leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May so their course amid that host conceive.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many who had escaped by quick retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont and those other furious three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thank God that he had given them legs and feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith to fly from that calamity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the Child and damsel new defeat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encounter, while with endlong course they flee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As man, no matter if he stands or run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeks vainly his predestined doom to shun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who ’scape one peril, into other fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pay the penalty of flesh and blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, by the teeth of dog, is wont to die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fox, together with her infant brood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By one who dwells her ancient cavern nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unearthed, and with a thousand blows pursued;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from some unsuspected place, that foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has filled with fire and smoke the den below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa and the Child, of danger clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enter the paynim ramparts; and, with eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upturned, the Saracens, with humble cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thank Heaven for the success of that emprize:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladins no longer are their fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The meanest Moor a hundred Franks defies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ’tis resolved, without repose, again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To drench with Christian blood the thirsty plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At once a formidable larum rose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Horns, drums, and shrilling clarions filled the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the wind ruffles, as it comes and goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Banner and gonfalon of various dyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Germans and the warlike Bretons close:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ranged on the other part, in martial wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Italians, English, French, were seen, and through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those armies furious war blazed forth anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The force of the redoubted Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And <em>that</em> of Agrican’s infuriate son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-323" id="noteref-323" epub:type="noteref">323</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> of Rogero, valiant’s copious font,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso’s, so renowned for trophies won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The martial maid, Marphisa’s fearless front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And might of Sacripant, excelled by none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made Charles upon Saint John and Denys call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fly for shelter to his Paris wall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of fierce Marphisa and her bold allies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unconquered daring and the wondrous might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir, was not of a nature⁠—of a guise⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be conceived, much less described aright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The number slaughtered hence may you surmise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What cruel blow King Charles sustained in fight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Add to these warriors of illustrious name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than one Moor with Ferraù known to Fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many through reckless haste were drowned in Seine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all too narrow was the bridge’s floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An wished, like Icarus, for wings in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having grim death behind them and before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save Oliver, and Ogier hight the Dane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladins are prisoners to the Moor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wounded beneath his better shoulder fled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first, that other with a broken head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, like Orlando and Duke Aymon’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-324" id="noteref-324" epub:type="noteref">324</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had faithful Brandimart thrown up the game,</span>

				<span class="i1">If he had scaped alive so fierce a flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart does his best, and when ’tis done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yields to the storm: thus Fortune, fickle dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now smiles upon the paynim monarch, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besieges royal Charlemagne anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From earth beneath the widow’s outcry swells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mingled with elder’s and with orphan’s prayer,</span>

				<span class="i1">Whose slaughtered bodies overspread the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Red blushed the blessed angel, who believed</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stir the Moors to strife, nor had obeyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had rather in their eyes who marked the event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared throughout to thwart his high intent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As servant faithful to his lord, and more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In love than memory strong, who finds that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has that forgotten which at his heart-core</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As precious as his life and soul should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hastes to repair his error, nor before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He mend that fault, again his lord will see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So not to God <abbr>St.</abbr> Michael will ascend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he has achieved his holy end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Again he to that monastery flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where whilom he had Discord seen; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seated in chapter sees her, while anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their yearly officers elected are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She taking huge delight those friers to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That at each other hurled their books of prayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hand within her locks the archangel twists,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deals her endless scathe with feet and fists.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On her he next a cross’s handle broke;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith her back, and arms, and head he plies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His mercy with loud voice the wretch bespoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hugged that angel’s knees with suppliant cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Michael suspends not the avenging stroke</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till hunted to the Moorish camp she flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then thus; “Believe worse vengeance yet in store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I beyond these lines behold thee more.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Albeit in back and arms all over shent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was Discord by that angel, in her fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of suffering yet again such chastisement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such horrid fury and such blows severe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She speedily to take her bellows went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, adding food to what she lit whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And setting other ready piles afire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kindled in many hearts a blaze of ire;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And good Rogero (she inflames them so)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Rodomont and Mandricardo fares</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Agramant; and all (since now the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynims pressed no more, the vantage theirs)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the seed of their dissensions show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what the bitter produce which it bears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to the judgment of the king refer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who first in listed field his claim should stir.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As well Marphisa to Troyano’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-325" id="noteref-325" epub:type="noteref">325</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relates her case, and will conclude the fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which with the Tartar king she had begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because by him provoked to that assay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will she yield her place to any one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No, not a single hour, yet less a day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with loud instances maintains her right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Mandricardo first to wage the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To have the first possession of the field</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less renowned king Rodomont contended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he, the African array to shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had interrupted and till now suspended.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero to King Agramant appealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As having borne too long, though sore offended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Rodomont form him detained his horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet would meet him first in martial course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Tartar king, for more perplexity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Denied on any ground Rogero’s right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bearer of the white-winged bird to be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was so passing wood with wrath and spite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if to this those others would agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would at once those several quarrels fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so those others would as well have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Agramant’s consent they could have won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Agramant, with prayer and kingly word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had willingly appeased that jarring crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But since the foes were deaf to all accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would assent to peace or truce anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Considered how at least he might afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field of each of them in order due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as the best resolve, at last decreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each should by lot possess the listed mead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Four lots the monarch bade prepare, which done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> “Rodomont and Mandricardo” said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Rogero and Mandricardo” were in one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In one, “Rogero and Rodomont” were read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> “Mandricardo and Marphisa” run:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, as the fickle goddess, Fortune, led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lots are drawn, and in the first appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar king and sovereign of Argier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero and Mandricardo for that play</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were next; Rogero and Rodomont were third;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa’s lot and Mardricardo’s lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At bottom; whence the dame was deeply stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor young Rogero seems a whit more gay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who knows the prowess of those two preferred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will nothing in the listed combat leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him or for Marphisa to achieve.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There lies a place, of Paris little wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covering a mile or somewhat less, and round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like ancient theatre, on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encompast by a tall and solid mound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With castle whilom was it fortified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sword and fire had levelled with the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Parmesan like circle does survey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whenever he to Borgo wends his way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In this place is prepared the listed mead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which palisades of little height inclose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A square, of just proportions for that need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With two capacious gates, as usage goes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The day on which to combat have agreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those valiant knights, who will not balk their foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the palisades, to left and right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Facing each entrance, are pavilions pight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that, which looks towards the western sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is lodged the giant monarch of Argier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him assist his serpent-hide to don</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Ferraù and Circassia’s cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso and the puissant Falsiron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that which fronts the morning hemisphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clothe with their hands, in Trojan plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The good successor of King Agricane.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>High on a throne of ample state appeared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant and Marsilius; next in place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were Stordilane and all the chiefs, revered</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout the squadrons of the paynim race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Happy was he who found himself upreared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On mound or tree, above that level space.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Great was the throng, and round the palisade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On every side the eddying people swayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Were seated with the Queen of fair Castille</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Queens, princesses, and dames of noble strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Arragon, Granada, and Seville,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Atlas’ columns; and amid the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assembled to behold that fierce appeal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was placed the daughter of King Stordilane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two costly vests⁠—one red, one green⁠—she wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ill the first was dyed, and faded sore.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-326" id="noteref-326" epub:type="noteref">326</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In dress succinct Marphisa sate; in plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as beseemed a warrior and a maid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thermodöon haply witnessed Hippolyte</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her fair squadron in like garb arrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afield already, in his livery dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant’s herald made proclaim, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“It was forbid to all men, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In act or word, with either part to side.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The frequent crowd expects the double foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And often, in impatience, they complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And call those famous cavaliers too slow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from the Tartar’s tent an angry strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is heard, and cries which multiply; sir, know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was the martial king of Sericane,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-327" id="noteref-327" epub:type="noteref">327</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And puissant Tartar, who that question stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made the mighty tumult which has heard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sericane’s monarch, having with his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equipt the king of Tartary all o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached to gird him with that sovereign brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which Orlando went adorned of yore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When “<em>Durindana</em>” on the hilt he scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Graved with the quartering that Almontes wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from that wretched man, beside a font,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Youthful Orlando reft in Aspramont.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, seeing this, agnised it for the blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So famous, which Anglantes’ warrior bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For which he had the fairest fleet arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ever put to sea from eastern shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had Castille’s rich kingdom overlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And conquered fruitful France some years before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cannot now imagine how that sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is in possession of the Tartar lord;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And asks, “had he by force or treaty won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when and where and how, that faulchion bright;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Mandricardo said that “he had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fierce battle for that sword with Brava’s knight;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-328" id="noteref-328" epub:type="noteref">328</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who feigned himself of sober sense foregone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping that so he should conceal his fright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘For I on him would ceaseless war have made,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He added,) ‘while he kept the goodly blade.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Saying, “The Count, in yielding to his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That sword, the Beavers’ known device had tried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, followed closely by the hunter, know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their fell pursuer covets nought beside.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he had heard him out⁠—“Nor I forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That sword to thee nor any one,” (replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso, fierce,) “well earned by me, at cost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of treasure, and of pain, and people lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Some other faulchion for thyself purvey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This will I have; nor deem my reasons new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether Orlando wise or foolish stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I make it mine where’er it meets my view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With none to witness, thou, beside the way</span>

				<span class="i1">Usurped that sword; I claim it as my due:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this my scimeter shall reasons yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And we will try the cause in listed field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Prepare to win the sword before thou rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That goodly blade against King Rodomont.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To win his arms is use of cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before his foe in duel he affront.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“No sweeter music ever soothes my ear”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Replied the Tartar, as he raised his front)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Than voice which champions me to martial field;</span>

				<span class="i1">But see that his consent the Sarzan<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-329" id="noteref-329" epub:type="noteref">329</a> yield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Be thou the first; and, next on listed ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let Sarza’s valiant lord the question try;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor doubt but I in readiness be found</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“⁠—Thou shalt not so the ordered lots confound,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It that be true Gradasso has averred,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Were one and the other Mars, for battle steeled,”</span>

				<span class="i1">“Nor one nor the other’s might should make me waive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My title to that shield and goodly glaive;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And overmastered by his choler, flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a clenched fist at him of Sericane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smites him with his right-hand in such wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As makes him quit his hold of Durindane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso bold was taken by surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not deeming him so furious and insane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, while he looked not to the Tartar lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found himself robbed of good Orlando’s sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fury and scorn Gradasso’s visage heats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seems to flash with fire, at that disgrace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with more rage and pain his bosom beats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that ’twas offered in such public place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To draw his scimeter, the king retreats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent upon revenge, some little space.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Mandricardo on himself relies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero he to fight, as well defies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Come on in arms against me, both combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be King Rodomont the third!” (he said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Come Spain and Afric and all human kind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ne’er will I turn.” And he, at nought dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, in his fury, sawed the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About him, with Almontes’ noble blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embraced his shield, and, full of choler, stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against Gradasso and Rogero good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Leave <em>me</em> the care,” the fierce Gradasso cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The frenzy of this madman to subdue.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Not so, by Heaven!” Rogero wroth replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For I this field claim justly as my due.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Stand back!” and “stand <em>thou</em> back!” on either side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They shout; yet neither of the twain withdrew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus among those three began a feud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence some strange result would have ensued,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If many had not interposed, and sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With little wit their fury to restrain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had well-nigh too dear the experience bought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of saving others at their proper pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to accord the world had ever brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those knights, but that the worthy king of Spain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-330" id="noteref-330" epub:type="noteref">330</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came thither with renowned Troyano’s heir;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-331" id="noteref-331" epub:type="noteref">331</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Awed by whose sovereign presence all forbear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant those contending warriors made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cause of their so burning strife display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next earnestly bestirred himself, and prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso that he would, in courteous way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concede the Trojan Hector’s goodly blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Mandricardo, solely for that day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the cruel fight was at an end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein he should with Rodomont contend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While royal Agramant would peace restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now with this and now with that conferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the other tent, between the Sarzan Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Sacripant, another strife was heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Valiant King Sacripant (as said before)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To equip Sir Rodomont himself bestirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he and Ferraù had that champion drest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his forefather Nimrod’s iron vest;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there had they arrived, where with his spume</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horse was making his rich bridle white:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of the good Frontino speak, for whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero urged with yet unfelt despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Sacripant, who plays the part of groom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And has to bring afield the Sarzan knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marks narrowly the courser’s gear and shoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sell and furniture throughout reviews;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as his points and nimble parts, more near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, in this view, observes with better heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youthful king, beyond all doubt, is clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees his Frontilatte in that steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him he of old had held so passing dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whilom of such debates the fruitful seed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for whose loss, whilere he was so woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He evermore on foot resolved to go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This from beneath him had Brunello<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-332" id="noteref-332" epub:type="noteref">332</a> borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before Albracca, on the very day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica’s rare ring, and Roland’s horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Balisarda he conveyed away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fierce Marphisa’s blade⁠—and on return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Afric⁠—to Rogero, from his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave Balisarda and the courser, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by the Child Frontino named anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Assured ’twas no mistake, Circassia’s chief</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned him about to Rodomont, and cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Reft from me in Albracca, by a thief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This horse is mine; which might be certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By them whose words would warrant well belief:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But as my witnesses are distant wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If it be questioned, I will make it plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will, with sword in hand, the truth maintain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet am I well contented, for that we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have for these some few days together gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lend him for to-day; since well I see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That not without him could the fight be done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But on condition, that the courser be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Acknowledged mine, and furnished as a loan:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Otherwise hope not for that horse, save first</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me, on this quarrel, thou in combat worst.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The furious king of Argier, that in pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surpassed all knights that ever girt the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose paragon, for heart and prowess tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseems no ancient histories record,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cried; “Sacripant, if any one beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thyself, to me should utter such a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should deem quickly, from its bitter fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from his birth would better have been mute.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, for that fellowship in which we went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As thou hast said) together, I to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such patience and forbearance am content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As warning thee, thy purpose to forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until thou shalt have witnessed the event</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of strife between me and my Tartar foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When him I such example hope to make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou shalt humbly say, ‘The courser take.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fierce and enraged, replied Circassia’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To play the churl with thee is courteous deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I to thee repeat more plain and clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou ill wouldst aught design against that steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, while I an avenging sabre rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This I prohibit thee, and, should it need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every better means of battle fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thee for this would battle, tooth and nail.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They from dispute proceed to ribaldry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From words to blows; and through their mickle ire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fierce battle was inflamed, and blazed more high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than ever lightly-kindled straw took fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont is steeled in panoply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sacripant neither plate nor mail attire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet so in fence is skilled that nimble lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seems all over sheltered by his sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No greater were the daring and the might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Though infinite) which Rodomont displayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the precaution and the nimble sleight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the Circassian summoned to his aid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No mill-wheel ever turns with swifter flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The circling stone by which the grain is brayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Sacripant at need moves foot or hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shifts now here, now there his restless stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Serpentine and Ferraù interfere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They with drawn swords the twain asunder bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With them Grandonio was and Isolier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many other leaders of the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was the tumult which was heard whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the other tent, what time they laboured sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero vainly to a peace to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Tartary’s and Sericana’s king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while some voice to Agramant the news</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reports aright, that Ulien’s might seed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-333" id="noteref-333" epub:type="noteref">333</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Sacripant, Circassia’s king, pursues</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fierce and furious quarrel for the steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant, whom so many jars confuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaims to King Marsilius; “Take thou heed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That no worse evil mid these knights betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While for this new disorder I provide.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont reined his anger, and retired</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some deal, at his approaching sovereign’s view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less respect in Sacripant inspired</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish monarch; of the furious two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with grave voice and royal mien inquired</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What cause of strife such deadly discord blew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having searched their quarrel to the root,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fain accord them; but with little fruit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Circassia’s monarch would not, on his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Longer his horse to Argier’s lord allow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save humbly Rodomont to him applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That steed for this occasion to bestow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him Sir Rodomont, with wonted pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned for answer: “Neither Heaven nor thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall make me recognize as gift or loan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What I with this good hand can make mine own.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king bade Sacripant explain his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how that horse was taken from him sought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this from first to last Circassia’s knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rehearsed, and reddened as the tale he taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relating to the king the robber’s sleight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who had surprised him overwhelmed with thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon four spears his courser’s saddle stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from beneath the naked horse conveyed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, whom these cries, mid others, bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When of the robbery of the horse advised,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In visage is disturbed, remembering</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How on that day her faulchion was surprised;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when that courser (which equipt with wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared when flying her) she recognized;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And recognized as well⁠—at first unknown⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant king who filled Circassia’s throne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The others who stood round her, wont to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello often boast of the deceit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Gan turn towards that wretch, and made appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By open signs they knew him for the Cheat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa who the subtle knave whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspected as the author of that feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now questions this, now that, who all accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In saying “ ’twas Brunello stole her sword;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who, well deserving as a fitting pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To dangle from the gallows-tree in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Agramant the crown of Tingitane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(An ill example) was preferred to wear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This fires anew Marphisa’s old disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor she from instant vengeance will forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, as well as other shame and scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She on her road had from that caitiff born.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A squire laced on her helmet, at her hest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wore the remnant of her armour sheen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor without martial cuirass on her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Find I, that she ten times was ever seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even from the day when first that iron vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Braced on her limbs the passing-valiant queen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With helm on head, where, mid the highest rows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello sits among the first, she goes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him by mid breast Marphisa griped amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lifted up the losel from the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As is rapacious eagle wont to strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pullet, in her talons circled round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bore him where the sons of King Troyane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard the two knights their jarring claims propound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who perceives himself in evil hands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye weeps, and mercy of that maid demands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above the universal noise and shout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which rose nigh equally on either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello, who from all the crowd about</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For pity now, and now for succour, cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So loud was heard, that of that ample rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gathered round himself the pressing tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived before the Moorish army’s head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him with haughty mien Marphisa said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This thief, (said she) thy vassal, will I slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with this hand of mine will knot the cord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About his neck; because the very day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stole <em>his</em> courser, he purloined <em>my</em> sword.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But is there any one who deems I say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amiss, let him stand forth and speak the word;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I on him will prove, before thine eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have done right, and who gainsays me, lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But because haply some one may pretend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have till such a time of strife delayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My vengeance, when such famous knights contend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For three days shall the wretch’s doom be stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the mean time let him who would defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That caitiff, come himself, or send him aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For afterwards, if none the deed prevent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His carcass shall a thousand birds content.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I hence to yonder tower, which distant nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three leagues, o’erlooks a little copse, repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with one varlet in my company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with one waiting-maid; if any dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rescue the thief, let him come thither; I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wait the approach of his defenders there.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus she; and thither quickly wends her ways</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither was said, nor any answer stays.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Held on the pommel grappled by his hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello on Marphisa’s courser lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The caitiff weeps, and shrieking in despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On all in whom he hopes, for succour cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such confusion is Troyano’s heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees no way through these perplexities;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, that Marphisa thence Brunello bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such a guise, yet grieved the monarch more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not that he loved the losel or esteemed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather to him some time had borne despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And often had to hand the caitiff schemed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he had forfeited the ring of might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here his honour touched the monarch deemed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that his visage reddened at the slight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would, in person, follow her at speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his utmost power avenge the deed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But the wise king, Sobrino, who was by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from the quest endeavoured to dissuade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And “that with his exalted majesty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such enterprise were ill assorted,” said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Although firm hope, nay full security,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had to overcome that martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he with pain subdued a woman, shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than honour, would pursue his name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Small profit and much peril would succeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From any fight he should with her maintain,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And he advised him) “as the better deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave that wretched caitiff to his pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And albeit but a simple nod should need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To free him, from that nod he should refrain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the monarch would do ill to force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even-handed Justice from her destined course.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou to the fierce Marphisa may’st apply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave his trial (he pursued) to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With promise, her in this to satisfy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to suspend him from the gallows-tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And even should the maid thy prayer deny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let her in every wish contented be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rather than that she desert thy side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let her hang him and every thief beside.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Right willingly King Agramant gave way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To King Sobrino’s counsel sage and staid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let renowned Marphisa wend her way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor scathed he, nor let scathe, that martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither endured that any her should pray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heaven knows with what courage he obeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That wise advice, to calm such ruder strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quarrel, as throughout his camp were rife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At this mad Discord laughed, no more in fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That any truce or treaty should ensue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scowered the place of combat there and here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could stand still, for pleasure at the view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pride gamboled and rejoiced with her compeer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the fire fresh food and fuel threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shouted so that Michael in the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew the glad sign of conquest in that cry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Paris-town rocked, and turbid ran the flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Seine at that loud voice, that horrid roar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, so it echo rang in Arden’s wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beasts left their caverns in that forest hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alp and Cevenne’s mountain-solitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Blois, and Arles, and Rouen’s distant shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rhine, Rhone, and Saône, and Garonne, heard the pest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scared mothers hugged their children to their breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Five have set up their rest, resolved to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first their different quarrels to conclude:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tangled so is one with other plea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ill Apollo’s self could judge the feud.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-334" id="noteref-334" epub:type="noteref">334</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To unravel that first cause of enmity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king began⁠—the strife which had ensued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because of beauteous Doralice, between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king of Scythia<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-335" id="noteref-335" epub:type="noteref">335</a> and her Algerine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Agramant oft moved, between the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here now there, to bring them to accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now there now here, admonishing that pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like faithful brother and like righteous lord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when he found that neither would forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deaf and rebellious to his royal word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would consent that lady to forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cause of strife, in favour of his foe,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As his best lore, at length the monarch said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to obey his sentence both were fain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he who was by her preferred, should wed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that what was established on his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should not be changed, to either’s loss or gain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The compromise was liked on either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since either hoped she would for him decide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The mighty king of Sarza, who long space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the Tartar, had loved Doralice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Who had preferred that sovereign to such grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As modest lady may, nor do amiss)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed, when she past sentence on the case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She must pronounce what would ensure his bliss.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thus alone King Rodomont conceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all the Moorish host with him believed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All know what exploits wrought by him had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her in joust and war; they all unsound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And weak King Mandricardo’s judgment ween;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, who oft was with her on their round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oftener private with the youthful queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the tell-tale sun was under ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, knowing well how sure he was to speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laughed at the silly rabble’s idle creed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They, after, ratify the king’s award,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between his hands, and next the suitors twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before that damsel go, that on the sward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixing her downcast eyes, in modest vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avows her preference of the Tartar lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At which sore wondering stand the paynim train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Rodomont remains so sore astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cannot raise his visage from the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But wonted anger chasing shame which dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Sarzan’s face all over, he arraigned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel’s sentence, of the faulchion, tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About his manly waist, the handle strained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the king’s and others’ hearing cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“By this the question shall be lost or gained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not by faithless woman’s fickle thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which thither still inclines, where least it ought.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Kind Mandricardo on his feet once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaims, “And be it as it pleases thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that ere yet the vessel made the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unploughed remained a mighty space of sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that this king reproved the Sarzan sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ruling, “that to appeal upon that plea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more with Mandricardo could avail,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made the moody Sarzan strike his sail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Branded with double scorn, before those peers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By noble Agramant, whose sovereign sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, as in loyal duty bound, reveres,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by his lady on the selfsame day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There will no more the monarch of Algiers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abide, but of his band⁠—a large array⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two serjeants only for his service takes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with that pair the paynim camp forsakes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the afflicted bull who has foregone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His heifer, nor can longer warfare wage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeks out the greenwood-holt and stream most lone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sands at distance from his pasturage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There ceases not, in sun or shade to moan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not for that exhales his amorous rage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So parts, constrained his lady to forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king of Argier, overwhelmed with woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero moved, his courser to regain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had already donned his warlike gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then recollecting, that on listed plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Mandricardo he must couch the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed not Rodomont, but turned his rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To end his quarrel with the Tartar, ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He met in combat Sericana’s lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within close barriers, for Orlando’s sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To have Frontino ravished in his sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be unable to forbid the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sorely grieves; but, when he shall that fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have done, resolves he will regain the steed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Sacripant, whom, like the youthful knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No quarrels in the Moor’s pursuit impede,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who was unengaged in other quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the Sarzan’s footsteps quickly prest;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And would have quickly joined him that was gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for the chance of an adventure rare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which him detained until the day was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made him lose the track of Ulien’s heir:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman who had fallen into the Saône,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who without his help had perished there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior drowning in that water found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stemmed the stream and dragged the dame aground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When afterwards he would remount the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him his restless charger broke astray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fled before his lord till evening fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lightly did the king that courser stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last he caught him; but no more could spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he had wandered from the beaten way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two hundred miles he roved, ’twixt hill and plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he came up with Rodomont again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How he by Sacripant was overtaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fought by him, to his discomfit sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he lost his courser, how was taken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say not now, who have to say before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With what disdain and with what anger shaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against his liege and love, the Sarzan Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth from the Saracen cantonments sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what he of the one and other said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wherever that afflicted paynim goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fills the kindling air with sighs that burn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Echo oft, for pity of his woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him from hollow rock is heard to mourn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O female mind! how lightly ebbs and flows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your fickle mood,” (he cries,) “aye prone to turn!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Object most opposite to kindly faith!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost, wretched man, who trusts you to his scathe!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Neither my love nor length of servitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though by a thousand proofs to you made clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had power even so to fix your faithless mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you at least so lightly should not veer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor am I quitted, because less endued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With worth than Mandricardo I appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for your conduct cause can I declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save this alone, that you a woman are.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I think that nature and an angry God</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Produced thee to the world, thou wicked sex,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be to man a plague, a chastening rod;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Happy, wert thou not present to perplex.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So serpent creeps along the grassy sod;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So bear and ravening wolf the forest vex;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wasp, fly, and gad-fly buzz in liquid air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the rich grain lies tangled with the tare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why has not bounteous Nature willed that man</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should be produced without the aid of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As we the pippin, pear, and service can</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Engraft by art on one another’s tree?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she directs not all by certain plan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather, upon a nearer view, I see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In naming her, she ill can act aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Nature is herself a female hight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet be not therefore proud and full of scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Women, because man issues from your seed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For roses also blossom on the thorn,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Despiteous, proud, importunate, and lorn</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These plaints and countless others to the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Poured forth the paynim knight, to fury stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now easing in low tone his troubled mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now in sounds which were at distance heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In shame and in reproach of womankind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet certes he from sober reason erred:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For we may deem a hundred good abound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where one or two perchance are evil found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though none for whom I hitherto have sighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Of those so many⁠—have kept faith with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All with ingratitude, or falsehood dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem not, I accuse my destiny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many there are, and have been more beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unmeriting reproach: but if there be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid hundreds, one or two of evil way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My fortune wills that I should be their prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet will I make such search before I die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather before my hair shall wax more white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That haply on some future day, even I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall say, “That one has kept her promise plight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And should not the event my trust belie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor am I hopeless) I with all my might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will with unwearied pain her praise rehearse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pen and ink and voice, in prose and verse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Saracen, whom rage no less profound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against his sovereign lord than lady swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who of reason thus o’erpast the bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ill of one and of the other said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fain behold that monarch’s kingdom drowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such a tempest, with such scathe o’erlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As should in Afric every house aggrieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor one stone standing on another leave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And would that from his realm, in want and woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant a mendicant should wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That through his means the monarch, brought thus low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fathers’ ancient seat might reascend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus he might the fruit of fealty show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And make his sovereign see, a real friend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was aye to be preferred in wrong or right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although the world against him should unite;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus the Saracen pours forth his moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rage against his liege and love possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on his way is by long journeys gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Giving himself and courser little rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The following day or next, upon the Saône</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He finds himself, who has his course addrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the coast of Provence, with design</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his African domain to cross the brine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From bank to bank the stream was covered o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With boat of little burden, which conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the supply of the invading Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victual, from many places round purveyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since even from Paris to the pleasant shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Acquamorta, all his rule obeyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—fronting Spain⁠—whate’er of level land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was seen, extending on the better hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The victual, disembarked from loaded barge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was laid on sumpter-horse or ready wain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sent, with escort to protect the charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where barges could not come; about the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fat herds were feeding on the double marge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought thither from the march of either reign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, by the river-side, at close of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In different homesteads lodged, the drovers lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king of Argier, (for the dusky air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of night began upon the world to close)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here listened to a village-landlord’s prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in his inn besought him to repose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—His courser stalled⁠—the board with plenteous fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is heaped, and Corsic wine and Grecian flows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, in all else a Moor, the Sarzan drank</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the forbidden vintage like a Frank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To warlike Rodomont, with goodly cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kindlier mien, the landlord honour paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he the port of an illustrious peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his guest’s lofty presence saw portrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, sore beside himself, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had scarce his heart within him, which had strayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her⁠—whilere his own⁠—in his despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor word escaped the melancholy knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mine host, most diligent in his vocation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the trade who throughout France were known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(In that he had, ’mid strange and hostile nation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every chance of warfare, kept his own)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Prompt to assist him in his occupation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some of his kin had called; whereof was none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who dared before the warrior speak of aught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing that paynim mute and lost in thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From thought to thought the Sarzan’s fancy flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself removed from thence a mighty space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sits so bent, and with such downcast eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never once looks any in the face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, after silence long, and many sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if deep slumber had but then given place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His spirits he recalls, his eyelids raises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the family and landlord gazes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then silence broke, and with a milder air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And visage somewhat less disturbed, applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him, the host, and those by-standers there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To know, “if any to a wife were tied;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And landlord and attendants⁠—“that all were,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Sarza’s moody cavalier replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He asked, “what each conceited of his spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if he deemed her faithful to her vows,”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Except mine host, those others were agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That chaste and good their consorts they believed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Think each man as he will, but well I read,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The landlord said,) “You fondly are deceived:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your rash replies to one conclusion lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you are all of common sense bereaved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so too must believe this noble knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless he would persuade us black is white.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Because, as single is that precious bird</span>

				<span class="i1">To one alone, should be the lot of all?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Erewhile I made the same mistake as you,</span>

				<span class="i1">And that more dames than one were virtuous thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until a gentleman of Venice, who,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, both from old and modern history,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his own, was ready with such store,</span>

				<span class="i1">As plainly showed that none to modesty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could make pretension, whether rich or poor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, if one appeared of purer strain,</span>

			<p>
				<span>“He of his many tales, among the rest,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So well one story in my head imprest,</span>
				<br/>

			<p>
				<span>Ladies, and all of you that ladies prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afford not, for the love of heaven, an ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this, the landlord’s tale, replete with lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In shame and scorn of womankind; though ne’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was praise or fame conveyed in that which flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From such a caitiff’s tongue; and still we hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sottish rabble all things rashly brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And question most what least they understand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Omit this canto, and⁠—the tale untold⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My story will as clear and perfect be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I tell it, since by Turpin it is told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not in malice or in rivalry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides, that never did my tongue withhold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your praises, how you are beloved by me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you I by a thousand proofs have shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vouching I am, and can but be, your own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let him who will, three leaves or four pass-by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor read a line; or let him, who will read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As little of that landlord’s history,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As of a tale or fiction, make his creed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to my story:⁠—When his auditory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw were waiting for him to proceed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that a place was yielded him, o’eright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier, he ’gan his tale recite:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Astolpho that the Lombard sceptre swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was King Monacho, his brother’s heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By nature with such graces was purveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few e’er with him in beauty could compare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such scarce Apelles’ pencil had portrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zeuxis’, or worthier yet, if worthier were:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beauteous he was, and so by all was deemed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But far more beauteous he himself esteemed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He not so much rejoiced that he in height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of grandeur was exalted o’er the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, for riches, subjects, and for might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the neighbouring kings he was the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that, superior to each other wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He beauty was throughout the world confest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This pleased the monarch, who the praise conferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that wherein he most delighted, heard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Faustus Latinus, one of his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who pleased the king, a Roman cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing ofttimes Astolpho now display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauties of his hand, now of his cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, questioned by that monarch, on a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ever in his lifetime, far or near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He any of such beauty had espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him thus unexpectedly replied:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Faustus to him replied: ‘By what I see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what I hear, is said by every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few are there that in beauty rival thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rather I those few confine to one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Jocundo is that one, my brother he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well I ween that, saving him alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou leavest all in beauty far behind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I in him thy peer and better find.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Impossible Astolpho deemed the thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hitherto had thought the palm his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such a longing seized the Lombard king</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To know that youth whose praises so were blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He prest, till Faustus promised him to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brother praised by him, before his throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Though ’twould be much if thither he repaired,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The courier added) ‘and the cause declared:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Because the youth had ne’er been known to measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all his life, a single pace from Rome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, on what Fortune gave him, lived at leisure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Contented in his own paternal dome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor had diminished nor increased the treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith his father had endowed that home;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he more distant would Pavia deem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Tanäis another would esteem;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And that a greater difficulty were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tear Jocundo from his consort; who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by such love united to that fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other will but hers the husband knew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet at his sovereign’s hest he would repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek the stripling, and his utmost do.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The suit with offers and with gifts was crowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which for that youth’s refusal left no ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Faustus set forth, and, after few days’ ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reached Rome, and his paternal mansion gained:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There with entreaties so the brother plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to that journey his consent obtained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wrought so well (though difficult to guide)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Silent even young Jocundo’s wife remained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He showing her what good would thence ensue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides what gratitude would be her due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Jocundo names a time to wend his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And servingmen meanwhile purveys and steeds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a provision makes of fair array;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For beauty borrows grace from glorious weeds.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside him or about him, night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye weeping, to her lord the lady reads;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘She knows not how she ever can sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long an absence, and not die with pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘For the mere thought produced such misery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed from her was ravished her heart’s core.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘Alas! my love (Jocundo cried) let be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy sorrows’⁠—weeping with her evermore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘So may this journey prosper! as to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will I return ere yet two months are o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor by a day o’erpass the term prescribed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though me the king with half his kingdom bribed.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This brought his troubled consort small content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, ‘that the period was too distant,’ said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ‘that ’twould be a mighty wonderment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If her, at his return, he found not dead.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The grief which, day and night, her bosom rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was such, that lady neither slept nor fed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that for pity oft the youth repented</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to his brother’s wishes had consented.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She from her neck unloosed a costly chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That a gemmed cross and holy relics bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which one, a pilgrim of Bohemia’s reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had gathered upon many a distant shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him did her sire in sickness entertain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning from Jerusalem of yore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence was made that dying pilgrim’s heir:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This she undoes, and gives her lord to wear;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And round his neck entreats him, for her sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That chain in memory of herself to wind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her gift the husband is well pleased to take;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that a token needs his love to bind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For neither time, nor absence, e’er will shake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor whatsoever fortune is behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her memory, which, rooted fast and deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He still has kept, and after death will keep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The night before that morning streaked the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixt for his journey, to his sore dismay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her husband deemed that in his arms would die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wife from whom he was to wend his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She slumbered not: to her a last goodbye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bade, while yet it lacked an hour of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mounted his nag, and on his journey sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While his afflicted spouse returned to bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Jocundo was not two miles on his road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he that jewelled cross recalled to mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he beneath his pillow had bestowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, through forgetfulness, had left behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Alas! (the youth bethought him) in what mode</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall I excuse for my omission find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that from this my consort shall not deem</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I little her unbounded love esteem?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He pondered an excuse; then weened’ twould be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of little value, if it were exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By page or other⁠—save his embassy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He did himself; his brother he addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘⁠—Now to Baccano ride you leisurely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there at the first inn set-up your rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I must back to Rome without delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But trust to overtake you by the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘No other but myself my need could do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doubt not but I shall speedily be back.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—No servant took he, but, with an adieu,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Jocundo, at a trot, wheeled round his hack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when that cavalier the stream was through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rising sun ’gan chase the dusky rack.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At home he lighted, sought his bed, and found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The consort he had quitted sleeping sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He, without saying aught, the curtains drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, what he least believed, within espied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he beneath the quilt, his consort true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chaste, saw sleeping at a stripling’s side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith Jocundo that adulterer knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By practice, of his features certified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he was a footboy in his train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nourished by him, and come of humble strain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To imagine his distress and wonderment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And warrant it, that other may believe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is better than to make the experiment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like this wretch, the cruel proof receive:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By anger stirred, it was his first intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To draw his sword, and both of life bereave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But love, which spite himself, he entertained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that ungrateful woman, him restrained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You see if like a vassal he obeyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This ribald Love, who left him not the force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wake her, lest to know her guilt surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should in his consort’s bosom move remorse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As best he could, he forth in silence made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stair descended, and regained his horse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Goaded by Love, he goads his steed again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ere they reach their inn rejoins his train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His change of mien to all was manifest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All saw his heart was heavy; yet not one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid these, in any sort, the reason guessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor read the secret woe which caused his moan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All thought he had to Rome his steps addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Woe to the town, surnamed of horns, had gone.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-337" id="noteref-337" epub:type="noteref">337</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Love has caused the mischief all surmise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though none of them conjectures in what wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His brother weened he was in grief immersed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For his deserted wife: he, on his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For other reason, inly chafed and cursed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That she was but too well accompanied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, with swelling lips and forehead pursed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ground that melancholy stripling eyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faustus, who vainly would apply relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill cheered him, witless what had caused his grief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He for his sore an evil salve had found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, where he should retire, increased his woes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, with the mention of his wife, that wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed and opened, which he sought to close.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rests not night nor day, in sorrow drowned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His appetite is gone, with his repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ne’er to return; and (whilom of such fame)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lovely visage seems no more the same.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His eyeballs seem deep-buried in his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His nose seems grown⁠—his cheeks are pined so sore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even remains (his beauty so is fled)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough to warrant what he was before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such fever burns him, of his sorrow bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He halts on Arbia’s and on Arno’s shore;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-338" id="noteref-338" epub:type="noteref">338</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if a charm is left, ’tis faded soon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And withered like a rose-bud plucked at noon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Besides that Faustus sorrowed to descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him so bested; worse cause for sorrowing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was to that courtier to appear to lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before Astolpho; he was pledged to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that was fairest deemed in every eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who must appear the foulest to that king;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet he continued on his way to wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And brought him to Pavia in the end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not that forthwith he lets the youth be seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest him the king of little wit arraign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He first by his dispatches lets him ween,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thither he Jocundo brings with pain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saying, that of his beauteous air and mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some secret cause of grief had been the bane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accompanied by a distemper sore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he seemed not what he was before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Glad was the monarch, of his coming taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As of a friend’s arrival he could be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since in the universal world was nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he so much desired as him to see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was the Lombard’s king displeased in ought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mark his guest’s inferiority;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though, but for his misfortune, it was clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He his superior would have been or peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lodged by him in his palace, every day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every hour, the stranger youth he sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Studious to honour him, and bids purvey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Store of provision for his better ease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While still his thoughts to his ill consort stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Jocundo languishes; nor pastimes please</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That melancholy man; nor music’s strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One jot diminishes his ceaseless pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Above his chambers, on the upper floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nearest the roof, there was an ancient hall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, in solitary mood, (for sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pastime and company, the stripling gall,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He aye betakes himself; while evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad thoughts some newer cause of grief recall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He here (who would believe the story?) found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A remedy unhoped, which made him sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“At that hall’s farther end, more feebly lighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For windows ever closed shut out the day)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where one wall with another ill united,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, through the chink, beheld a brighter ray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There laid his eye, and saw, what he had slighted</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As hard to credit, were it but hearsay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hears it not, but this himself descries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet hardly can believe his very eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He of the Queen’s apartment here was sight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-339" id="noteref-339" epub:type="noteref">339</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her choicest and her priviest chamber, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never introduced whatever wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save he most faithful was esteemed: he there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he was peeping, saw an uncouth fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A dwarf was wrestling with the royal fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such that champion’s skill, though under-grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in the strife his opposite had thrown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As in a dream, Jocundo stood, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself, awhile of sober sense bereaved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, but when of the matter certified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sure it was no dream, his sight believed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘A scorned and crooked monster,’ (then he cried,)</span>

				<span class="i1">And greatest monarch; Oh! what appetite!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And he the consort to whom he was wed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her he most used to blame, recalled to mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for the stripling taken to her bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To deem the dame less culpable inclined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less of herself than sex the fault he read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to one man could never be confined:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thought, if in one taint all women shared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least <em>his</em> had not with a monster paired.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To the same place Jocundo made return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the same hour, upon the following day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, putting on the king the selfsame scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again beheld that dwarf and dame at play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so upon the next and following morn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For⁠—to conclude⁠—they made no holiday:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While she (what most Jocundo’s wonder moved)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pygmy for his little love reproved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One day, amid the rest, the youth surveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame disordered and opprest with gloom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having twice summoned, by her waiting-maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The favoured dwarf, who yet delayed to come;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A third time by the lady sent, she said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘Engaged at play, Madonna, is the groom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, lest he lose a doit, his paltry stake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will that discourteous churl his game forsake.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“At such strange spectacle, the Roman knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleared up his brow, his visage and his eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He jocund, as in name, became in sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And changed his tears for smiles: with altered guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He waxed ruddy, gay, and plump in plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seems a cherubim of Paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that such change with wonderment all see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brother and king, and royal family.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If from the youth Astolpho wished to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence this sudden light of comfort came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less Jocundo this desired to show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the king such injury proclaim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But willed that like himself he should forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Revenge upon the author of that shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, that he might discern her guilt, yet spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made him on the Agnus Dei swear.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-340" id="noteref-340" epub:type="noteref">340</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He made him swear that he, for nothing said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or seen, which might to him displeasing be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Though he, in what he should discover, read</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would, now or ever, venge him on his head:</span>

				<span class="i1">Moreover him he bound to secrecy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the ill doer ne’er, through deed or word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might guess his injured king that case had heard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The monarch, who to every thing beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could better have given credit, freely swore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the cause Jocundo signified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why he had many days lamenting sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘Because he had his evil wife espied</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vowed he should in fine have died of grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he for longer time had lacked relief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘But that within his highness’ palace said,</span>

				<span class="i1">For, if foul shame had fallen upon his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least he was not single;’ saying so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to that chink the Lombard monarch led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who spied the mannikin of hideous show.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He against every wall his head would smite⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would cry aloud⁠—would break the solemn pact,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet kept parforce the promise he had plight;</span>

				<span class="i1">And gulped his anger down and bitter scorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since on the holy water he had sworn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou wilt not let me on the sinners wreak.’</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if the wives of others can be won</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king is pleased to hear the youth impart</span>

				<span class="i1">After some season, wearied are the twain</span>

				<span class="i1">To execute Astolpho’s project bent,</span>

				<span class="i1">Seeing he, for two days, that horse’s might</span>

				<span class="i1">—As well he for his ease embarked the steed,</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor big nor deeply laden, she, at large,</span>

				<span>Rather within his head or heart always</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The selfsame grief sate heavy on his sprite</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such fire was not by water to be drowned,</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor he his nature changed by changing ground.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-358" id="noteref-358" epub:type="noteref">358</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the sick man who with a fever grows,</span>

				<span class="i1">By land or water, for his secret grief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont brooked no more aboard to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bade them land him, and by Lyons hied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Vienne and Valence next took his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the rich bridge in Avignon descried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For these and more, which ’twixt the river lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Celtiberian hills upon that side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Theirs, from the day they conquered the champaigne)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obeyed the kings of Afric and of Spain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To pass to Afric straight, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kept to the right, towards Acquamorta’s shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lighted on a stream and hamlet, dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Ceres and to Bacchus, which that Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found quitted by the peasants, in their fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As often by the soldier harried sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beach upon one side broad ocean laved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the other yellow harvests waved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, newly built upon a hillock’s crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A little church the Saracen espied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoned by its priesthood, like the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For war was flaming upon every side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont of this place himself possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, from its site, as well as lying wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fields, from whence he tidings loathed to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So pleased him, he for it renounced Argier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He changed his scheme of seeking Afric’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So this fair spot seemed fit for his behoof!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here housed carriages, and steed, and band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together with himself, beneath one roof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At few leagues’ distance, did Montpelier stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other wealthy towns, not far aloof.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The village was upon a river’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that its every need might be supplied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here standing, full of thought, upon a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such was his common wont) the paynim spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Advancing by a narrow path, which lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through a green meadow, from the adverse side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lovely damsel, that upon her way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by a bearded monk accompanied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these behind them led a lusty steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bore a burden, trapt with sable weed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who that attendant monk and damsel were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what that burden, will to you be clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remembering Isabella is the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charged with the corse of her Zerbino dear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I left her, where from Provence, in the care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that good sire, she bowned herself to steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom persuaded, had the lady given</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The remnant of her virtuous life to heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Although in her pale face and troubled guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sorrow of that dame is manifest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although two fountains are her streaming eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sobs aye issue from her burning breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more beside of suffering testifies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With what a load of grief she is opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, in her faded cheek such beauties meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love and the Graces there might fix their seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as he of Sarza saw appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous dame, he laid the thought aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hatred to that gentle race and dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom alone the world is glorified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And best by Isabel the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed his former love would be supplied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one love by another be effaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As bolt by bolt in timber is displaced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her with the kindest mien and mildest tone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he could fashion, met the Sarzan knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom the dame her every thought made known;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said, when she was questioned of her plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“She would with holy works⁠—this world forgone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seek favour in her Heavenly Father’s sight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud laughed that godless paynim at the thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who every faith and worship held at nought;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And said, “that she from reason wandered wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And termed her project sudden and unsound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deemed her less to blame than those who hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through greediness, their treasure under ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And keep it from the use of all beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though hence no profit to themselves redound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rightly were prisoned lion, snake, and bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ill whate’er is innocent and fair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monk, that to this talk has lent an ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prompt with advice that mournful dame to stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lest she quit her course, prepared to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bark, like practised pilot, on her way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sumptuous table, rich in spiritual cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had speedily bestirred him to array;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, born with evil taste, that paynim rude</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sooner tasted, than he loathed, the food.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And having interrupted him in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor having power to make him stint his lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That paynim, stirred to fury, broke the rein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of patience, and assailed the preacher hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But haply wearisome might seem the strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I upon this theme dilated more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So here I close, nor words will idly spend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Admonished by that ancient’s evil end.</span>

			<p>
				<span>O feeble and unstable minds of men!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How quickly our intentions fluctuate!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All thoughts we lightly change, but mostly when</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These from some lover’s quarrel take their date.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now, so wroth I saw that Saracen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With woman, so outrageous in his hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I weened not only he would ill assuage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But never more would calm, his amorous rage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That which he rashly uttered to your blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye gentle dames, does so my spirit grieve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till I his error teach him, to his shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shall no quarter at my hands receive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So him with pen and page will I proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, whosoever reads me, shall believe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had better held⁠—aye, better bit, his tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than ever have your sex with slander stung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But that in this the witless infidel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spake as a fool, the event demonstrates clear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even now, with dagger drawn, that paynim fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fury on all women whomsoe’er.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next him so touched one look of Isabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She quickly made his fickle purpose veer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her, scarce seen, and to that warrior strange,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would his Doralice already change;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, as new love the king did heat and goad,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He moved some arguments of small avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shake her steadfast spirit, which abode</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wholly with God; but he, her shield and mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hermit, lest she from the better road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should wander, and her chaste intention fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With stronger arguments with him contended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still, as best he could, the dame defended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king, who long had taxed himself to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monk’s bold sermon to his sore displeasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly bade him to his cell repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew, without that damsel, at his leisure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet seeing he would still his patience dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor peace with him would keep, nor any measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that preacher’s chin his right-hand laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whatsoe’er he grasped, as rudely flayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And (so his fury waxed) that, as it were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With tongs, he griped his neck, and after he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had whirled him once or twice about in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dismist him form his hand towards the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say not⁠—know not, what befell him there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many the rumours are, and disagree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One says, “he burst upon a rock’s rude bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lay one shapeless jelly, heels and head.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He fell into the sea,” by one is said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Distant three miles and more; and, in that sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He having prayer, and Ave vainly made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he knew not how to swim, was drowned.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others report, “a Saint bestowed his aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dragged him with a visible hand aground.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whichever be the reading of this mystery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him I speak no further in mine history.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cruel King Rodomont, when from his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had removed the prating eremite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With visage less disturbed, again applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that sad lady, heartless with affright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in the language used by lovers, cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“She was his very heart, his life, his light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She was his comfort, and his dearest hope;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all such words as have that common scope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now, so temperate showed that infidel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem that he no violence designed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle semblance of fair Isabel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enamoured him, so tamed his haughty mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though he might that goodly kernel shell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim would not pass beyond the rhind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who that its favour would be lost, believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless ’twere as a gift from her received;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And by degrees so thought to mould the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his desires. She in that lone retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And savage, open to his evil aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And like a mouse, beneath Grimalkin’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had liefer found herself i’ the midst of flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever on one thought her fancy beat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If any mode, if any way, remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scape that wilful man, untouched, unstained.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sad Isabella in her mind is bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay herself with her own hand, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fell barbarian compass his intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be the means to make her wrong so sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cavalier, by cruel Fortune spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within her loving arms, to whom she swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With mind to him devoted, his to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vowing to Heaven perpetual chastity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She sees that paynim monarch’s passion blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Increasing still, nor what to do she knows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well knows what foul intention is behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which she is all too feeble to oppose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet moving many matters in her mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds out at last a refuge for her woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And means to save her chastity from shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(How I shall say) with clear and lasting fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She cried unto that paynim, foul to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already threatening her with word and act,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now devoid of all that courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he in the beginning did enact,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If thou mine honour wilt ensure to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond suspicion, I, upon this pact,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will upon thee bestow what shall o’erpay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By much, that honour thou wouldst take away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For pleasure, which endures so brief a space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith this ample world does so o’errun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reject not lightly a perpetual grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A real joy, to be postponed to none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of women everywhere of pleasing face</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred and a thousand may be won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But none beside me, or few others, live</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who can bestow the boon which I can give.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I know, and on my way a herb did view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nearly know where I on this could light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, being boiled with ivy and with rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over a fire with wood of cypress dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And squeezed, when taken from the caldron, through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Innocent hands, affords a juice of might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith whoever thrice his body laves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destructive steel or fire securely braves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-359" id="noteref-359" epub:type="noteref">359</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If thrice therewith he bathe himself, I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His flesh no weapon for a month shall score:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He once a month must to his body lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mine unction, for its virtue lasts not more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This liquor can I make, and will to-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou to-day shalt also prove my lore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well, I trust, thou shalt more grateful be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than were all Europe won to-day by thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In guerdon for this present, I request</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou to me upon thy faith wilt swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou never wilt my chastity molest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In word or deed.” So spake that damsel fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Rodomont who heard, again represt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His evil will: for so he longed to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A charmed life, that readily he more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Isabel of him demanded swore;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And will maintain his promise, till the fact</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vouched of that wondrous water shall appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And force himself, meanwhile, to do no act,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To show no sign of violence; but the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolves he will not after keep the pact,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one who holds not God or saint in fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to that king, regardless of his oath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All lying Afric yields in breach of troth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Argier’s perfidious king to Isabel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than a thousand times assurance swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In case that water rendered him what fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achilles and what Cygnus were of yore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, aye by beetling cliff and darksome dell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Away from city and from farm, a store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of herbs collected, nor this while e’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoned by the paynim cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When herbs enow by them in many a beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With or without their roots, collected were,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-360" id="noteref-360" epub:type="noteref">360</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At a late hour, the twain to their retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Betook them; and, throughout night’s remnant, there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That paragon of continence did heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What simples she had culled, with mickle care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While to those mysteries and her every deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pagan, present still, gave curious heed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who, wearing out the weary night in sport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—He and those followers that with him remained⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had suffered thirst in such a grievous sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the fierce fire in that small cave contained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That drinking round, in measure full or short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Graecian wine two barrels had they drained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A booty which those squires who served the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From travellers seized a day or two before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Argier’s warlike king, unused to wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cursed, and forbidden by his law, esteemed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The liquor, tasted once, appeared divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sweeter than nectar or than manna seemed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, quaffing largely, now of Ishmael’s line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sober use deserving censure deemed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fast their cups with that good wine they fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each reveller’s head is whirling like a mill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile that lady from the fire does lift</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pot, wherein she cooked those herbs, and cries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Rodomont; “In proof I not adrift</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have launched the words I spake, in random guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—By <em>that</em>, which can the truth form falsehood sift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Experience, which can make the foolish wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even now the thing shall to thyself be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not on another’s body, but my own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I first will trial make” (that lady said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Of this choice liquor with rare virtue blest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest haply thou shouldst harbour any dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That mortal poison form these herbs be prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this will I anoint myself, from head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Downwards below the naked neck and breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then prove on me thy faulchion and thine arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prove if one can smite, the other harm.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She washed, as said, and gladly did decline</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her neck to that unthinking pagan’s brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unthinking, and perhaps o’ercome by wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which neither helm, nor mail, nor shield withstand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That brutish man believed her, and, in sign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of faith, so struck with cruel steel and hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That her fair head, erewhile Love’s place of rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He severed from the snowy neck and breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This made three bounds, and thence in accents clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was heard a voice which spake Zerbino’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow whom, escaping Sarza’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So rare a way was taken by the dame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spirit! which nobly didst esteem more dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy plighted faith, and chaste and holy name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Things hardly known, and foreign to our time)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than thine own life and thine own blooming prime!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Depart in peace, O spirit blest and fair!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—So had my verses power! as evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I would assay, with all that happy care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which so adorns and points poetic lore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as renowned should be thy story rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thousands and thousands of long years and more!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Depart in peace to radiant realms above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leave to earth the example of thy love!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His eyes from heaven did the Creator bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the stupendous and unequalled feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said: “I thee above that dame commend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose death drove Tarquin from his royal seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I to register a law intend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid those which ages change not as they fleet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which⁠—I attest the inviolable river⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unchanged through future times, shall last for ever.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-361" id="noteref-361" epub:type="noteref">361</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will that all, in every future age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bear thy name, be blest with genius high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be courteous, gentle, beautiful, and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the real pitch of honour fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That to their glory the historic page</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They may with worthy argument supply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that for aye Parnassus’ hill and well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall ring with Isabel and Isabel.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the Sire; and cleared the ambient air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hushed beyond its wont the heaving main.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the third heaven her chaste soul made repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in Zerbino’s arms was locked again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth, with shame and sorrow for his share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That second Breuse sans pity did remain;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-362" id="noteref-362" epub:type="noteref">362</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when digested was the maddening bowl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamented sore his error, sad at soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That placated, or in some content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sainted soul of Isabel might be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if to death that damsel he had shent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He might at least revive her memory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, as a means to compass his intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would turn into a tomb that church, where he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inhabited, and where she buried lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you shall be related in what wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In all parts round about this chosen site,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For love or fear, he master-masons found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, making full six thousand men unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stript of their heavy stones the mountains round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And raised a fabric ninety yards in height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From its extremest summit to the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he within its walls the church enclosed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein entombed the lovers twain reposed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This nearly imitates that pile beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Old Tyber’s stream, by Adrian built;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-363" id="noteref-363" epub:type="noteref">363</a> and nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sepulchre, will he a tower provide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein he purposes some time to lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A narrow bridge, and only two yards wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He flung across the stream which rolled fast by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long, but so scanty is that bridge, with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The narrow pass two coursers can contain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two coursers, that abreast have thither made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or else, encountering, on that causeway meet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any where was ledge or barricade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stay the horses’s fall, who lost his feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wills <em>that</em> bridge’s toll be dearly paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Christian or by Moor, who pass his seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For with a thousand trophies, arms, and vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That damsel’s tomb is destined to be drest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within ten days, or shorter time, was placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bridge, whose arch across the stream was dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not that pile and tower with equal haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were so conducted to their destined height.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet was the last so high, a sentry paced</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its top, who, whensoever any knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached the bridge, was wont his lord to warn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounding a signal on his bugle-horn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whereat he armed, and issued for the stower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now upon <em>one</em> and now the <em>other</em> side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For when a warrior pricked towards the tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from the adverse bank that king defied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bridge affords the field their steeds must scour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, should one but a little swerve aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Peril unparalleled!) the horse will go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the deep and dangerous stream below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The pagan had imagined, as a pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, risking oft to tumble in the course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Head-first into that stream, where he must drain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Huge draughts of water in his fall, parforce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would assoil and cleanse him from that stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof excess in wine had been the source;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if what ill wine prompts to do or say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Water, as well as wine, could wash away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon thitherward flocked many a cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some who pursued the beaten road and plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since for wayfaring men, who southward steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No straighter lay for Italy or Spain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their courage and their honour, held more dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than life, excited others of the train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all, where they had hoped the meed of strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had lost their arms, and many arms and life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If those he conquers are of pagan strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is content to take their arms and vest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of those first arrived the titles plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are written, and their arms suspended rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he in prison pens the christened train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(’Twould seem) to be to Argier’s realm addrest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not yet was brought that building to a head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thitherward the crazed Orlando sped.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It chanced Orlando, in his furious mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came thither where that foaming river ran;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Rodomont beside the mighty flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was hurrying on his work; nor yet were done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tower and tomb, the bridge, scarce finished, stood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here⁠—save his casque was open⁠—Ulien’s son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-364" id="noteref-364" epub:type="noteref">364</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Steeled cap-a-pee, stood ready armed for fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to the bridge approached Anglantes’ knight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-365" id="noteref-365" epub:type="noteref">365</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando running thus his wild career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The barrier tops, and o’er the bridge would fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But sullen Rodomont, with troubled cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afoot, as he that tower is standing nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he disdains to brandish sword or spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shouts to him from afar with threatening cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Halt! thou intrusive churl and indiscreet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rash, meddling, saucy villain, stay thy feet!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Only for lord and cavalier was made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not for thee, dull slave, that bridge was meant.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this no heed insane Orlando paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, fixt upon his purpose, forward went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“This madman must I school,” the paynim said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was approaching with the fell intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him into that deep river to dispatch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deeming in such foe to find his match.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while, a gentle damsel sought the place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That towards that bridge across the river rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Richly arrayed and beautiful of face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sage reserve in her demeanor showed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis she that, of her Brandimart in chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(If you remember, sir,) through every road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And place her lover seeks in anxious wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excepting Paris, where the warrior lies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Flordelice that bridge and tower was near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was by name the wandering damsel hight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grappling with Roland stood the Sarzan peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would into that river pitch the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, conversant with Brava’s cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The miserable county knew aright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mighty marvel in that dame it raised</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see him rove, a naked man and crazed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She stopt, the issue of that strife to know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein those two so puissant warriors vied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His opposite by might and main to throw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the stream each doughty champion tried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How can a fool such mighty prowess show?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between his teeth, the furious paynim cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, shifting here and there, was seen to strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brimfull of pride, and anger, and disdain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This hand and now that other he puts out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take new hold, where he his vantage spies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now within Roland’s legs, and now without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Locks his right foot or left, in skilful wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus resembles, in that wrestling bout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stupid bear, who in his fury tries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tree, from whence he tumbled, to o’erthrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming it sole occasion of his woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roland, whose better wit was lost withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know no where, and who used force alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That utmost force, to which this earthly ball</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply affords few paragons, or none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let himself backwards in that struggle fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embracing as he stood with Ulien’s son.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together in the foaming stream they sank;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">High flashed the wave, and groaned the echoing bank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quickly the stream asunder bore the pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland was naked, and like fish could swim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here shot his feet, his arms extended there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gained the bank; nor, when upon the brim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Halted to mark if his adventure were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achieved with praise or shame: in evil trim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pagan, by his arms impeded sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With heavier pain and trouble, toiled ashore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Along the bridge which spanned that foaming tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did Flordelice meantime securely pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having vainly sought on every side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart’s bearing, since nor iron case</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor vest of his she anywhere espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She hoped to find the knight in other place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here return we of the count to tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who left behind him stream, bridge tower, and cell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twere frenzy of his every frantic feat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To promise the relation, one by one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many and many⁠—should I these repeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not when my story would be done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet some of his notorious deeds, and meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For mention in my song, will I make known:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will I not that wondrous one recount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Near Thoulouse, on the Pyrenaean Mount.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much country had been traversed by the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Urged by the furious rage which him misguides:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last he reached the hill whose boundary height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arragonese and neighbouring Frank divides.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither directing aye his course outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the descending sun his visage hides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He reached a path upon the rugged steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which overhung a valley dark and deep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here he by chance encountered in mid road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two youths, that wood men were, and drove before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An ass along that pathway, with a load</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of logs; they, marking well what scanty store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of brain in poor Orlando’s head was stowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Called to the approaching knight, and threatened sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding him stand aside, or else go back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to their hindrance block the common track.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To this address Orlando answered nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that his foot he to their beast applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote in mid-breast, which, with that vigour fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That force exceeding every force beside⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tost him so hight, that the beholders thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was a bird in air which they descried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ass upon a mountain-summit fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which rose above a mile beyond that dell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon those youths next sprang the furious knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With better luck than wit, one woodman shear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that tall cliff, twice thirty yards in height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast himself headlong downward in his fear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him a moist patch of brambles, in his flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Received; and, amid grass and bushes, here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From other mischief safe, the stripling lit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for some scratches in his face was quit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That other to a jutting fragment clung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who so to gain the higher steep would strive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he hopes, if once those crags among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To keep him from that fool he may contrive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But by the feet Orlando, ere he sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seized him, who will not leave the wretch alive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stretching them as wide as he could strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So stretched his arms, he rent his prey in twain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even in such mode as often we descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Falconer by heron or by puller do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose entrails he plucks out, to satisfy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Merlin or falcon that the game pursue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How happy was that other not to die!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who risked his neck in that deep bottom, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rehearsed the tale so often, Turpin heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And handed down to us the wondrous word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These and more marvels does the count, who bends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His steps across that mountain to the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, seeking long a path, at length descends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the south, upon the land of Spain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His way along the beach he after wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Near Arragon, beside the rumbling main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ever prompted by his frenzy rank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will make himself a dwelling on the bank,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where he somedeal may shun the noontide ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With dry and powdery sea-sand covered o’er;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here, while so employed, upon their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrives Angelica with her Medore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, as you have been told in former lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had from the hills descended on that shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within a yard or less approached the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere yet she of his presence was aware.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So different from himself was he to sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nought of Orlando she in him surveyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, from the time that rage possest his sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had gone naked forth in sun and shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he been born on hot Syene’s site,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sands where worship is to Ammon paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or nigh those hills, whence Nile’s full waters spin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando had not borne a dingier skin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nigh buried in their sockets are his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spare in his visage, and as dry as bone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dishevelled is his hair in woeful wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With frightful beard his cheek is overgrown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sooner is he seen, than backward flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, who, trembling sore, is flown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She shrieking loud, all trembling and dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Betakes her to her youthful guide for aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When crazed Orlando was of her aware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seize the damsel he upsprang in haste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So pleased the wretched count her visage fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So quickly was his mood inflamed: effaced</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In him all ancient recollections are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How she by him was whilom served and graced.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind her speech the count and hunts that dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As questing dog pursues the sylvan game.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The youth, that sees him chase his love who fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His courser spurs, and in pursuit is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With naked faulchion after him he sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cut and thrust at Roland as he run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from his shoulders hoped to cleave his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But found the madman’s skin as hard as bone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, harder far than steel, nor to be harmed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So good Orlando at his birth was charmed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When on his back Orlando felt him beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turned, and turning on his youthful foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote with clenched fist, and force which nought can meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Smote on his horse’s head, a fearful blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with skull smashed like glass, that courser fleet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was by the madman’s furious stroke laid low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the same breath Orlando turned anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chased the damsel that before him flew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At speed Angelica impelled her mare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whipt and spurred her evermore; whom slow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would esteem, albeit that palfrey were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet faster than a shaft dismist from bow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her ring she thought upon, and this the fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Placed in her mouth; nor failed its virtue now;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For putting it between her lips, like light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguished by a puff, she past from sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was it through fear, or was she, while she stript</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This from her finger, shaken in her seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or was it rather, that her palfrey tript,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For neither <em>this</em> nor <em>that</em> I surely weet)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, while ’twixt her lips she slipt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The virtuous ring, and hid her visage sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her stirrups lost; and, tumbling form the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reversed upon the sand that lady fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If but two inches short had fallen his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her would have pounced Orlando near;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would have crushed her in his furious way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that kind Fortune saved her from the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let her by other theft herself purvey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other palfrey, as she did whilere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For never will she have this courser more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who chased by swift Orlando scours the shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Doubt not that she another will provide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And follow we in mad Orlando’s rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose rage and fury nevermore subside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wroth that Angelica should disappear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After that beast along the sands he hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye gaining on the mare in this career.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, now he touches her, and lo! The mane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He grasps, and now secures her by the rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando seizes her with that delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other man might seize a damsel fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bit and bridle he adjusts aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Springs on her back, and o’er the sea-beach bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many miles impels the palfrey’s flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without repose or pause, now here, now there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever sell or bridle be displaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let her grass or heartening forage taste,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in this course to o’erleap a ditch he sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Head over heels, she with her rider went:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor harmed was he, nor felt that tumble aright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she, with shoulder slipt, lay foully shent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long how to bear her thence Orlando thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the end upon his shoulders hent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the bottom climbed, thus loaded sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And carried her three bowshots’ length and more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next, for he felt that weight too irksome grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He put her down, to lead her by the rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who followed him with limping gait and slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Come on,” Orlando cried, and cried in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, could the palfrey at a gallop go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This ill would satisfy his mood insane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The halter from her head he last unloosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith her hind off-foot the madman noosed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis thus he comforts and drags on that mare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she may follow with more ease, so led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who whiles despoiled of flesh, and whiles of hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is scathed by stones which that ill road o’erspread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length the misused beast, with wear and tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the rude rocks, and suffering sore, lies dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando nought the slaughtered mare regards,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor anywise his headlong course retards.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To drag that palfrey ceased he not, though dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Continuing still his course towards the west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all this while sacked hamlet, farm, and stead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whenever he by hunger was distrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And aye to glut himself with meat, and bread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fruit, he every one by force opprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One by his hand was slain, one foully shent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seldom he stopt, and ever onward went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As much, or little less, would do the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By his own love, did not that damsel hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the wretch discerns not black from white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And harms where he would help. A curse betide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wonder-working ring, and eke the wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who gave it to that lady, full or pride!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Roland, but for this, would venge the scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He and a thousand more from her had borne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Would that of her Orlando were possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of all women that are above ground!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For one and all are ingrates at the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is in all an ounce of goodness found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But it is meet I let my hearer rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere my strained chords return a faltering sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he may less tedious deem the rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defer my story till another time.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Restored to sense, the beauteous Bradamant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Finds sage Melissa in the vaulted tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hears from her of many a famous plant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warrior, who shall issue from her womb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next, to release Rogero from the haunt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of old Atlantes, learns how from the groom,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Who will vouchsafe me voice that shall ascend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As high as I would raise my noble theme?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will afford befitting words, and lend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wings to my verse, to soar the pitch I scheme?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since fiercer fire for such illustrious end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than what was wont, may well my song beseem.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this fair portion to my lord is due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sings the sires from whom his lineage grew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Than whose fair line, ’mid those by heavenly grace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chosen to minister this earth below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You see not, Phoebus, in your daily race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that in peace or war doth fairer show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lineage that hath longer kept its place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still shall keep it, if the lights which glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within me, but aright inspire my soul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the blue heaven shall turn about the pole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But should I seek at full its worth to blaze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not mine were needful, but that noble lyre</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sounded at your touch the thunderer’s praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the giants sank in penal fire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet should you instruments, more fit to raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The votive work, bestow, as I desire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All labour and all thought will I combine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shape and shadow forth the great design.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till when, this chisel may suffice to scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stone, and give my lines a right direction;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply future study may avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring the stubborn labour to perfection.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return we now to him, to whom the mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hawberk, shield, and helm, were small protection:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of Pinabel the Maganzeze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hopes the damsel’s death, whose fall he sees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wily traitor thought that damsel sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had perished on the darksome cavern’s floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with pale visages hurried his retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that, through him contaminated door.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, thence returning, clomb into his seat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, like one who a wicked spirit bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To add another sin to evil deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bore off with him the warlike virgin’s steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leave we sometime the wretch who, while he layed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Snares for another, wrought his proper doom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turn we to the damsel he betrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had nigh found at once her death and tomb.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, after rising from the rock, dismayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At her shrewd fall, and gazing through the gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld and passed that inner door, which gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entrance to other and more spacious cave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For the first cavern in a second ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fashioned in form of church, and large and square;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With roof by cunning architect extended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On shafts of alabaster rich and rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flame of a clear-burning lamp ascended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the central altar; and the glare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Illuminating all the space about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shone through the gate, and lit the cave without.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Touched with the sanctifying thoughts which wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On worthy spirit in a holy place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She prays with eager lips, and heart elate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the Disposer of all earthly grace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, kneeling, hears a secret wicket grate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the opposing wall; whence, face to face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman issuing forth, the maid addresses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Barefoot, ungirt, and with dishevelled tresses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O generous Bradamant,” the matron cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Know thine arrival in this hallowed hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was not unauthorized of heavenly guide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the prophetic ghost of Merlin told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou to this cave shouldst come by path untried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which covers the renowned magician’s mould.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here have I long time awaited thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell what is the heavens’ pronounced decree.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This is the ancient memorable cave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Merlin,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a> that enchanter sage, did make:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou may’st have heard how that magician brave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was cheated by the Lady of the Lake.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Below, beneath the cavern, is the grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which holds his bones; where, for that lady’s sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His limbs (for such her will) the wizard spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Living he laid him there, and lies there dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet lives the spirit of immortal strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lodged in the enchanter’s corpse, till to the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The trumpet call it, or to endless pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it with dove or raven’s wing shall rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet lives the voice, and thou shalt hear how plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From its sepulchral case of marble cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since this has still the past and future taught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To every wight that has its counsel sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Long days have passed since I from distant land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My course did to this cemetery steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the solemn mysteries I scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Merlin to me the truth should better clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having compassed the design I planned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A month beyond, for thee, have tarried here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Merlin, still with certain knowledge summing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Events, prefixed this moment for thy coming.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The daughter of Duke Aymon stood aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And silent listened to the speech; while she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew not, sore marvelling at all that passed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ’twere a dream or a reality.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length, with modest brow, and eyes downcast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Replied (like one that was all modesty),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And is this wrought for me? and have I merit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy the workings of prophetic spirit?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And full of joy the adventure strange pursues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moving with ready haste behind the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who brings her to the sepulchre which mews</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bones and spirit, erst of Merlin’s name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tomb, of hardest stone which masons use,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shone smooth and lucid, and as red as flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that although no sun-beam pierced the gloom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its splendour lit the subterraneous room.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether it be the native operation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O certain stones, to shine like torch i’ the dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or whether force of spell or fumigation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(A guess that seems to come more near the mark)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sign made under mystic constellation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The blaze that came from the sepulchral ark</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discovered sculpture, colour, gems, and gilding,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whatsoever else adorned the building.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarcely had Bradamant above the sill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifter her foot, and trod the secret cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the live spirit, in clear tones that thrill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Addressed the martial virgin from the grave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“May Fortune, chaste and noble maid, fulfil</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine every wish!” exclaimed the wizard brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Since from thy womb a princely race shall spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose name through Italy and earth shall ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The noble blood derived from ancient Troy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mingling in thee its two most glorious streams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be the ornament, and flower, and joy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of every lineage on which Phoebus beams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where genial stars lend warmth, or cold annoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Indus, Tagus, Nile, or Danube gleams;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in thy progeny and long drawn line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall marquises, counts, dukes, and Caesers shine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Captains and cavaliers shall spring from thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who both by knightly lance and prudent lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall once again to widowed Italy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her ancient praise and fame in arms restore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in her realms just lords shall seated be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such Numa and Augustus were of yore),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with their government, benign and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall re-create on earth the golden age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then, that the will of Heaven be duly brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a fair end through thee, in fitting date,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from the first to bless thy love has wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And destined young Rogero for thy mate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let nothing interpose to break that thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But boldly tread the path perscribed by fate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let aught stay thee till the thief be thrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By thy good lance, who keeps thee from thine own.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here Merlin ceased, that for the solemn feat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa might prepare with fitting spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To show bold Bradamant, in aspect meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heirs who her illustrious race should swell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence many sprites she chose; but from what seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evoked, I know not, or if called from hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gathered in one place (so bade the dame),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In various garb and guise the shadows came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This done, into the church she called the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she had drawn a magic ring, as wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might contain the damsel, prostrate laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the full measure of a palm beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on her head, lest spirit should invade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pentacle for more assurance tied.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So bade her hold her peace, and stand and look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then read, and schooled the demons from her book.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! forth of that first cave what countless swarm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Presses upon the circle’s sacred round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when they would the magic rampart storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds the way barred as if by fosse or mound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then back the rabble turns of various form;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when it thrice with bending march has wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the circle, troops into the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where stands that beauteous urn, the wizard’s grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To tell at large the puissant acts and worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And name of each who, figured in a sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is present to our eyes before his birth,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Said sage Melissa to the damsel bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To tell the deeds which they shall act on earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were labour not to finish with the night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence I shall call few worthies of thy line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As time and fair occasion shall combine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“See yonder first-born of thy noble breed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who well reflects thy fair and joyous face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, first of thine and of Rogero’s seed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-27" id="noteref-27" epub:type="noteref">27</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall plant in Italy thy generous race.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In him behold who shall distain the mead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his good sword with blood of Pontier base;</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Greek, Italian, Frank, and Spaniard die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lo! who in priestly vesture clad, is crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With purple hat, conferred in hallowed dome!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis he, the wise, the liberal, the renowned</span>

				<span class="i1">Hippolitus, great cardinal of Rome;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-62" id="noteref-62" epub:type="noteref">62</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose actions shall in every region sound,</span>

				<span class="i1">Where’er the honoured muse shall find a home:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whose glad era, by indulgent heaven,</span>

				<span>“His deeds adorn his race, as from his car</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The glorious sun illumes the subject earth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than the silver moon or lesser star;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So far all others he transcends in worth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I see this captain, ill bested for war,</span>

				<span class="i1">Go forth afflicted, and return in mirth:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Backed by few foot, and fewer cavaliers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-64" id="noteref-64" epub:type="noteref">64</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He homeward barks, and fifteen gallies steers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Two Sigismonds, the first, the second, see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To these Alphonso’s five good sons succeed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose glories spread o’er seas and land shall be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first shall wed a maid of France’s seed.</span>

				<span class="i1">This is the second Hercules; and <em>he</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-65" id="noteref-65" epub:type="noteref">65</a></span>

				<span class="i1">(That you may know their every name and deed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippolitus; who with the light shall shine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his wise uncle, gilding all his line.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Francis the third comes next; the other two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alphonsos both;⁠—but yet again I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy line through all its branches to pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair virgin, would too long protract thy stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Phoebus, many times, to mortal view,</span>

				<span class="i1">Would quench and light again the lamp of day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, with thy leave, ’tis time the pageant cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I dismiss the shades and hold my peace.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So with the lady’s leave the volume closed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose precepts to her will the spirits bent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they, where Merlin’s ancient bones reposed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the first cavern disappearing, went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then Bradamant her eager lips unclosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since the divine enchantress gave consent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And who,” she cried, “that pair of sorrowing mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alphonso and Hippolitus between?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sighing, those youths advanced amid the show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their brows with shame and sorrow overcast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With downward look, and gait subdued and slow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw the brothers shun them as they passed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa heard the dame with signs of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus, with streaming eyes, exclaim’d at last:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Ah! luckless youths,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-66" id="noteref-66" epub:type="noteref">66</a> with vain illusions fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither by wicked men’s bad counsel led!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O, worthy seed of Hercules the good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let not their guilt beyond thy love prevail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! the wretched pair are of thy blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many prevailing pity turn the scale!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a sad and softer tone pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I will not further press the painful tale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chew on fair fancy’s food: Nor deem unmeet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will not with a bitter chase the sweet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Soon as to-morrow’s sun shall gild the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his first light, myself the way will show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To where the wizard knight Rogero sties;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And built with polished steel the ramparts glow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long as through deep woods thy journey lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till, at the sea arrived, I shall bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such new instructions for the future way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou no more shalt need Melissa’s stay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All night the maid reposes in the cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the best part in talk with Merlin spends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with persuasive voice the wizard grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her Rogero’s honest love commends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till from the vault goes forth that virgin brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As through the sky the rising sun ascends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By path, long space obscure on either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weird woman still her faithful guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They gain a hidden glen, which heights inclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mountains inaccessible to man:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they all day toil on, without repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where precipices frowned and torrents ran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (what may some diversion interpose)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sweet subjects of discourse together scan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In conference, which best might make appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rugged road less dismal and severe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of these the greater portion served to guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such the wise woman’s scope) the warlike dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And teach by what device might be untied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s gyves, if steadfast were her flame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If thou wert Mars himself, or Pallas,” cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sage Melissa; “though with thee there came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than King Charles or Agramant command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the wizard foe thou could’st not stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Besides that it is walled about with steel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And inexpugnable his tower, and high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides that his swift horse is taught to wheel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And caracol and gallop in mid sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bears a mortal shield of power to seal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as ’tis exposed, the dazzled eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so invades each sense the splendour shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he who sees the blaze remains as dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And lest to shut thine eyes, thou should’st suppose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might serve, contending with the wizard knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How would’st thou know, when both in combat close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he strikes home, or when eschews the fight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to escape the blaze which blinds his foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And render vain each necromantic sleight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have here a speedy mean which cannot miss;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can the world afford a way but this.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“King Agramant of Africa a ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thieved from an Indian queen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-67" id="noteref-67" epub:type="noteref">67</a> by subtle guiles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has to a baron of his following</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Consigned, who now precedes us by few miles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello he. Who wears the gift shall bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To nought all sorceries and magic wiles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In thefts and cheats Brunello is as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Instructed, as the sage in charm and spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Brunello, he so practised and so sly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As now I tell thee, by his king is sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he with aid of mother wit may try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of this ring, well proved in like event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take Rogero from the castle high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So has he boasted, by the wizard pent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his lord such promise did impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has Rogero’s presence most at heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That his escape to thee alone may owe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to the king, the youthful cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How to release Rogero from his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his enchanted cage, prepare to hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three days along the shingle shalt thou go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the sea, whose waves will soon appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee the third day shall to a hostel bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he shall come who bears the virtuous ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That thou may’st recognise the man, in height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less than six palms, observe one at this inn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of black and curly hair, the dwarfish wight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beard overgrown about the cheek and chin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With shaggy brow, swoln eyes, and cloudy sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A nose close flattened, and a sallow skin;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this, that I may make my sketch complete,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Succinctly clad, like courier, goes the cheat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thy conversation with this man shall turn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon enchantment, spell, and mystic pact:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou shalt, in thy talk, appear to yearn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove the wizard’s strength, as is the fact.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, lady, let him not thy knowledge learn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his good ring, which mars all magic act:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shall propose to bring thee as a guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the tall castle, whither thou would’st ride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Follow him close, and viewing (for a sign),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now near, the fortress of the enchanter hoar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let no false pity there thy mind incline</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stay the execution of my lore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give him his death; but let him not divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy thought, nor grant him respite; for before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine eyes, concealed by it, the caitiff slips</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If once he place the ring between his lips.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discoursing thus, they came upon the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Garonne near fair Bordeaux meets the tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, fellow travellers no more to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some natural tears they drop and then divide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Duke Aymon’s child, who slumbers not till she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Release her knight, holds on till eventide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas then the damsel at a hostel rested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Sir Brunello was already guested.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The maid Brunello knows as soon as found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So was his image on her mind impressed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And asks him whence he came, and whither bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he replies and lies, as he is pressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame, who is forewarned, and knows her ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigns too as well as he, and lies her best:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And changes sex and sect, and name and land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her quick eye oft glances at his hand;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft glances at his resless hand, in fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might undetected make some prize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever lets the knave approach too near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well knowing his condition: In this guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The couple stand together, when they hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A sudden sound: but what that sound implies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, sir, shall tell hereafter with its cause;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first shall break my song with fitting pause.</span>

					<span class="i1">For whom fair Bradamant, his spouse, does stay,</span>

			<p>
				<span>When Reason, giving way to heat of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Herself from hasty choler ill defends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, hurried on by blind and furious mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We with the tongue or hand molest our friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though the offence is, after, wept and rued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The penance which we pay is poor amends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! I sorrow and lament in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For what I said in other angry strain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But like sick man am I, who, sore bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffering with patience many and many a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When against pain he can no more make head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yields to his rage, and curses; pain give way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with it the impetuous wrath is fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which moved his ready tongue such ill to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he is left his willful rage to rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cannot that which he has done undo.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well hope I, from your sovereign courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your pardon, since I crave it, ladies bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You will excuse, if moved by madness, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rave in my passion; let your censure light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On foe, who treats me so despiteously,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I could not be reduced to worser plight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who prompts what sore repents me: Heaven above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows how she wrongs me, knows how well I love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No less beside myself than Brava’s peer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-366" id="noteref-366" epub:type="noteref">366</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I, nor less my pardon should obtain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, who by mead or mountain, far or near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had scowered large portion of the land of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragging that jennet in his wild career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dead as she was, behind him by the rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, where a river joined the sea, parforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoned on the bank her mangled corse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he, who could like any otter swim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leapt in, and rose upon the further side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold! a mounted shepherd at the brim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, his horse to water in the tide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor when he saw Orlando coming, him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eschewed, whom naked and alone he spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“My jennet for thy hackney were I fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To barter,” cried the madman to the swain:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her will I show thee, if thou wilt; who dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the river’s other margin fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At leisure may’st thou have her cured,” (he said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And of no other fault have I to tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give me thy hackney, with some boot instead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prythee, dismount thee, for he likes me well.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The peasant, laughing, answered not a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But left the fool and pricked towards the ford.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hearest thou not? hola! I want thy steed,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cried Roland) and advanced with wrathful cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A solid staff and knotted, for his need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That shepherd had, wherewith he smote the peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose violence and ire all bounds exceed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seems withal to wax more fierce than e’er:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cuff he levels at that rustic’s head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And splits the solid bone, and lays him dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then leaping on his horse, by different way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The country scowers, to make more spoil and wrack:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That palfrey never more tastes corn or hay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that few days exhaust the famished hack.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not afoot does fierce Orlando stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will not, while he lives, conveyance lack.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many as he finds, so many steeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Their masters slain⁠—he presses for his needs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He came at last to Malaga, and here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did mightier scathe than he had done elsewhere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For now⁠—besides that the infuriate peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all its people left the country bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor (such the ravage) could another year</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The desperate havoc of the fool repair⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many houses burnt he, or cast down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sacked was a third of that unhappy town.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Departing thence, insane Orlando flees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Zizera, a seaward town, whose site</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is in Gibraltar’s bay, or (if you please)</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">Filled with a party; and for pleasure dight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, for their solace, to the morning gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that summer sea, had spread their sail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hoah! the boat! put back!” the count ’gan cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was in mind to go aboard their barge:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But vainly on their ears his clamours die:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For of such freight none willingly take charge.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As swiftly as a swallow cleaves the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Furrowing the foamy wave the boat goes large.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando urges on, with straightening knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whip and spur, his horse towards the sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He plunged into the waves, at last, parforce;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For vainly would he shun the waters green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bathed are knees, paunch, and croup, till of that horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarcely the head above the wave is seen:</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He spurs his horse amid the billows high,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser ends his swim and life in fine,</span>

				<span class="i1">But that himself the madman’s arms upbear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sinewy arms and either palm he rowed,</span>

				<span class="i1">And puffed and blew the brine before; the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breathed softly, and the water gently flowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well was needed weather more than fair:</span>

				<span class="i1">As twice an archer’s hand could shoot at score.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many days along the bank he hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At hazard, ever westward hurrying sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he came where on the sea-beat strand</span>

				<span class="i1">Who scaped, in time, from him of wit unsound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards, upon her homeward way,</span>

				<span class="i1">Was with good bark and better weather bound;</span>

			<p>
				<span>To say so many things I am intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I mean not to pursue the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Mandricardo my fair argument</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It now behoves me, in his turn, to veer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He happily enjoyed, his rival spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauty, left in Europe without peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since fair Angelica from hence had wended,</span>
				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Mandricardo, proud that in his right</span>

				<span class="i1">His lady had adjudged the amorous suit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enjoys not her award with full delight;</span>

				<span class="i1">Since others with him other points dispute.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By young Rogero claimed, that eagle white</span>

				<span class="i1">Of one disastrous quarrel is the root;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another moves the king of Sericana</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the Tartar king, for Durindana.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant and Marsilius strive in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With labour sore, this tangle to undo;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-368" id="noteref-368" epub:type="noteref">368</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only cannot they persuade the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In peace and concord to unite anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cannot make the valiant Child refrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From claiming Hector’s buckler as his due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet Gradasso move the sword to lend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till <em>this</em>, or till <em>that</em>, quarrel have an end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero brooks not that in other fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shield be braced, nor will Gradasso bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That save against himself the Tartar knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should wield the sword Orlando used to wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“See we, in fine, on whom the chance will light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cries Agramant) and further words forbear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Fortune rules the matter let us see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And choose him that of her shall chosen be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And⁠—would ye do what most would me delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be an obligation evermore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You shall by casting lots decide your right:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Premising, he whose lot is drawn before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other, shall upon two quarrels fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So he who wins, on his companion’s score</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall win as well as on his own; and who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loses the battle lose alike for two.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Between Rogero and Gradasso, we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deem there is little difference, rather none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wot whichever shall elected be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms will make his martial prowess known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As for the rest, let doubtful victory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descend on him whom Heaven is pleased to own!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the vanquished knight no blame shall fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But we to Fortune will impute it all.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero and Gradasso, at this say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Agramant, stood silent, and agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he whose lot first issued, the assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should undertake for both in listed mead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus in two scrolls, inscribed in the same way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their names are writ as destined to succeed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These afterwards are cast into an urn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which much they shake and topsy turvy turn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A seely boy then dipt his hand and drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A billet from the vase, and if befell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thereon Rogero’s name the assistants knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Gradasso’s left behind⁠—I cannot tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How joyed renowned Rogero at the view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And can as little say what sorrow fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon Gradasso, on the other side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he parforce his fortune must abide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gradasso every thought and every deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Employs, Rogero to instruct and aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the strife his champion may succeed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And teaches every sleight he has assayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—How best to manage sword and shield at need⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—What strokes are feints, and what with vantage made⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when he should tempt Fortune, when eschew⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reminds him, one by one, in long review.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the drawing lots and king’s award,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What of the day remained the champions spent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As wont, in giving tokens of regard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this or to that other warrior sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people, greedy for the fight, toward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field is gone, and many not content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wending thither ere the dawn of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the place of combat watch all night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The foolish rabble anxiously attends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those goodly champions’ contest for the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A crowd which neither sees nor comprehends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other than that which is before its eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But they who know what boots and what offends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Marsilius and Sobrino, and the wise⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Censure the fight, and monarch that affords</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A field of combat to those martial lords.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor, “what a heavy loss he would sustain”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cease they to royal Agramant to read)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Were Mandricardo or Rogero slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thing by cruel Destiny decreed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since they, to combat against Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of one of these alone have greater need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than of ten thousand more, amid which crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They scarce would find one champion good and true.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant recognized this truth; but thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ill his royal word could be repealed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet Mandricardo and the Child besought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That they the right, conferred by him, would yield:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More; that the question was a thing of nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor worthy to be tried in martial field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prayed them⁠—would they not obey his hest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least somewhile, to let their quarrel rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Five or six months would they the strife delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or more or less, till Charles defeated were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stript of mantle, crown, and royal sway.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But each, though he would willingly forbear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And much desired his sovereign to obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood out against the Moorish monarch’s prayer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since either deemed <em>he</em> would be foully shent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to this treaty first should yield consent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But more than king, than all, who sought in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To soften Agrican’s infuriate son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauteous daughter of King Stordilane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamented, besought him, woe-begone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besought him he would do what all would fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold by the relenting warrior done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Lamenting her, as through the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ever kept in agony and fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas! and what (exclaims she) can I find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which may avail to minister repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If aye, by this or that desire inclined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You don your harness to affront new foes?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What boots it to restore my harassed mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I behold one fearful quarrel’s close,</span>

				<span class="i1">If one as fierce already kindled be?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Woe worth me! I was proud, with little right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So good a king, so stout a cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he should in the fierce and dangerous fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Peril his life, who now, I see to clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a ground of strife so passing light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the same risk prepares to couch the spear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You, more than love for me, to strife impels</span>

			<p>
				<span>“But if the love you force yourself to show,</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">By this I pray you, by that chastening woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which does my spirit, does my heart oppress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be not concerned, because the bird of snow</span>

				<span class="i1">Rogero, pictured on his shield, possess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not wherefore you should joy or grieve</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he the blazoned buckler bear or leave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Much evil may ensue and little gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of the battle you to wage prepare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small guerdon will be bought with mickle pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If from Rogero you his eagle bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if your fortune shifts on listed plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She whom you hold not captive by her hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You cause an evil with such mischief fraught,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Accompanying words with tears and sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such, or such like speech she him did pray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout that livelong night, in piteous wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping her lover’s anger to allay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Mandricardo, sucking from her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those sweet tears, glittering in their humid ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that sweet moan, from lips more deeply dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than crimson rose, himself in tears, replied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alack! my dearest life! take thou no dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alack! for love of Heaven! of thing so light:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if (to my sole harm) with banners spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their following of the Frank or paynim rite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant and Charles united led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This need not cause you matter for affright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What poor account you make of me is clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this one, sole, Rogero breeds such fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And yet should you remember how alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor had I scimetar or sword in hand)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of knights, with a spear’s truncheon overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I singly cleared the field, an armed band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though to his shame and sorrow this he own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso tells to them who make demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was my prisoner in the Syrian tower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet other than Rogero’s is his power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not King Gradasso will the truth deny:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sacripant knows it and your Isolier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say King Sacripant of Circassy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Aquilant, and Gryphon, famous peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hundreds⁠—yea and more⁠—from far and nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made prisoners at that fearful pass whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Baptised or Infidel; and all by me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From prison on the selfsame day set free.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And even yet they marvel evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the great feat which I performed that day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greater than if the squadrons of the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Frank united I had held at bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shall Rogero, new to martial lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me, onto to one, with scathe or scorn appay?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And me shall now this young Rogero scare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Hector’s sword and Hector’s arms I wear?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! as I might have won you from my foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why did I not for you in arms contend?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I so had them my valour shown, I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You would have well foreseen Rogero’s end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For heaven’s sake dry your tears, nor by such woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—An evil omen for my arms⁠—offend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And learn, ’tis Honour pricks me to the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not an argent bird and blazoned shield.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said he; and with reasons passing good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him that dame replied, with saddest face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only would have changed his sullen mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would have moved a pillar from its place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would the champion quickly have subdued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though she was gowned, he locked in iron case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And make him satisfy the Moorish lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Agramant spake further of accord;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And had; but that Aurora⁠—on his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ushering aye the sun⁠—no sooner stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than young Rogero, anxious to display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That rightfully he bore Jove’s beauteous bird,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cut the quarrel short, and lest delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be further interposed, in act or word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where round the palisade the people close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appears in armour and his bugle blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When that loud sound is by the Tartar heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the proud warrior to the strife defies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more of treaty will he hear a word:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From bed upspringing, “Arms,” the monarch cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shows a visage with such fury stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doralice dares no longer peace advise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor speak of treaty or of truce anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now parforce the battle must ensue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Tartar arms himself in haste; with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wonted service of his squires he tarries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This done, he springs upon the steed amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile the champion’s who defended Paris;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-369" id="noteref-369" epub:type="noteref">369</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him with speed towards the listed plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixt for that fierce assay, the courser carries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even then the king and barons thither made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the strife was little time delayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Put on and laced the shining helmets were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And given to either champion was the spear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly the trumpet’s blast was heard in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose signal blanched a thousand cheeks with fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Levelled those cavaliers their lances bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spurring their warlike steeds to the career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in mid champaign, meet with such a shock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Earth appears to rive and Heaven to rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From this side and from that, the eagle flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Jove in air was wonted to sustain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hurtled, but with plumes of different hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those others often on Thessalian plain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-370" id="noteref-370" epub:type="noteref">370</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beamy lances, rested by the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well warranted the warriors’ might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And worse than that encounter had withstood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So towers resist the wind, so rocks the flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Turpin truly writes, into the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upwent the splinters, broke in the career;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For two or three fell flaming from on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had ascended to the starry sphere.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-371" id="noteref-371" epub:type="noteref">371</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knights unsheathed their faulchions from the thigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like those who were little moved by fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For new encounter wheeled, and, man to man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pointing at one another’s vizor ran.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They, pointing at the vizors’ sight, attacked,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor with their faulchions at the steeds took aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each other to unhorse, unseemly act!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since in that quarrel they are nought to blame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those err, nor know the usage, why by pact</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deem they were bound their horses not to maim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without pact made, ’twas reckoned a misdeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And an eternal blot to smite a steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They level at the vizor, which is double,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet resists such mighty blows with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The champions evermore their strokes redouble</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster than pattering hail, which mars the grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bruises branch and leaf, and stalk and stubble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cheats the hopes of the expecting swain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you is known the force of either brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And known the force of either warrior’s hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But yet no stroke well worthy of their might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those peers have dealt, so cautious are the twain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar’s faulchion was the first to bite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which was good Rogero well nigh slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By one of those fell blows which either knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So well could plant, his shield was cleft in twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath, his cuirass opened to the stroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the quick the cruel weapon broke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The assistants’ hearts were frozen at the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So did Rogero’s danger them appal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom the many’s favour, well they know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wishes rest, if not of one and all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then (had Fortune ordered matters so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the most part desired they should befall)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taken had been the Tartar king or slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So had that blow offended all the train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I think that blow was by some angel stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save Rogero from the mischief near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet at the king (nor answer he delayed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He dealt a stroke more terrible than e’er.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Mandricardo’s head he aims his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such the fury of the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such his haste, he less my blame deserves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If slanting from the mark his faulchion swerves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had Balisarda smote him full, though crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Hector’s helm, the enchantment had been vain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-372" id="noteref-372" epub:type="noteref">372</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So reels the Tartar, by that stroke astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the bristle-hand lets go the rein:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrice with his head he threats to smite the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While his unguided courser scowers the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Brigliadoro, whom by name you know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, for his change of master, full of woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Never raged trampled serpent, never so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raged wounded lion, as in fell despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raged Mandricardo, rallying from that blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had deprived of sense the astonied knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as his pride and fury waxes, grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As much, yea more, his valour and his might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He at Rogero makes his courser vault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sword uplifted high for the assault.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Poised in his stirrups stood the Tartar lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And aiming at his foeman’s casque, believed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with the stroke of his descending sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero to the bosom should have cleaved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from that youth, yet quicker in his ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wound beneath his arm the king received,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which made wide daylight in the stubborn mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That clothed the better armpit with its scale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero drawing Balisarda back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out sprang the tepid blood of crimson stain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence Mandricardo’s arm did vigour lack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with less dint descended Durindane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet on the croup the stripling tumbled back,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Closing his eyelids, through excess of pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And memorable aye had been that blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had a worse helmet clothed the warrior’s brow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For this he pauses not, but spurs amain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Mandricardo smites in the right side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here little boots the texture of the chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the well wealded metal’s temper tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against that sword, which never falls in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which was enchanted to no end beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that against it nothing should avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enchanted corselet or enchanted mail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whate’er that sword takes-in it shears outright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the Tartar’s side inflicts a wound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He curses Heaven and raves in such despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less horribly the boisterous billows sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He now prepares to put forth all his might:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The shield, with argent bird and azure ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hurls, with rage transported, from his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grasps with right and left his trenchant brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Marry,” (Rogero cried,) “it needs no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove your title to that ensign vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which now you cast away, and cleft before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can you more your right in it maintain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, he parforce must prove how sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The danger and the dint of Durindane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which smites his front, and with such weight withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mountain lighter than that sword would fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If cleft his vizor through the midst; ’twas well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from the sight diverged the trenchant blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on the saddle’s plated pommel fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet its double steel the faulchion stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It reached his armour (like soft wax, the shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oped, and the skirts wherewith ’twas overlaid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And trenched upon his thigh a grievous wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that ’twas long ere he again waxed sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The spouting blood of either cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their arms had crimsoned in a double drain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence diversly the people guessed, which peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have the better of the warlike twain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But soon Rogero made the matter clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that keen sword, so many a champion’s bane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this he at that part in fury past</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence Mandricardo had his buckler cast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He the left side of his good cuirass gored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found a passage to the heart below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which a full palm above the flank he bored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that parforce the Tartar must forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His every title to the famous sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The blazoned buckler, and its bird of snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yield, together with these seeds of strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Dearer than sword and shield⁠—his precious life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not unavenged the unhappy monarch dies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in the very moment he is smit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sword⁠—for little period his⁠—he plies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good Rogero’s vizor would have split.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he stopt the stroke in wary wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And broke its force and vigour ere it lit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its force and vigour broke: for he, below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The better arm, first smote his Tartar foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Smit was the Child by Mandricardo’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the same moment he that monarch slew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, albeit thick, divides an iron band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good steel cap beneath it; inches two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lies buried in the head the trenchant brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The solid bone and sinew severed through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astound Rogero fell, on earth reversed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his head a stream of life-blood burst.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero was the first who went to ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so much longer did the king delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh every one of those who waited round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weened he the prize and vaunt had borne away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, erred his Doralice, that oft was drowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In tears, and often clad in smiles that day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thanked her God, with hands to Heaven extended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in such wise the fearful fight had ended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when by tokens manifest appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The live man living and the dead man slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The favourers of those knights, with change of cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some weep and some rejoice, an altered train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King, lord, and every worthiest cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crowd round Rogero, who has risen with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him to embrace and gratulate they wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And do him grace and honour without end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Each with Rogero is rejoiced, and feels</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That which he utters in his heart; among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crowd the Sericane alone conceals</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other than what he vouches with his tongue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He pleasure in his countenance reveals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With envy at the conquest inly stung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—were his destiny or chance to blame⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Curses whiche’er produced Rogero’s name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What of Rogero’s favour can be said?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What of caresses, many, true, and kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Agramant? that not without his aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have unrolled his ensigns the wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had to move from Afric been afraid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would have trusted in his host combined.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, now King Mandricardo is no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteems him the united world before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor to Rogero lean the men alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him incline as well the female train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for the land of France had left their own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the troops of Afric or of Spain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Doralice, herself, although she moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for her lover, cold and pale, complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save by the griding curb of shame represt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her voice, perchance, had added to the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say perchance, nor warrant it I dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit the thing may easily be true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such his manners, such his merits are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So beauteous is Rogero’s form to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She (from experience we are well aware)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So prone to follow whatsoe’er is new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That not to play the widow’s lovelorn part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She on Rogero well might set her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though he did well alive, what could be done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Mandricardo, after he was dead?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis fitting she provide herself with one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That her, by night or day, may bravely stead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile to young Rogero’s succour run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king’s physician in his art best read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, having seen the fruits of that fell strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already has ensured Rogero’s life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant bids them diligently lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wounded warrior in his tent, and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is evermore beside him, night and day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him with such love he watches, with such care:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his bed the Tartar’s arms and buckler gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So bade the Moorish king, suspended were;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspended all, save trenchant Durindana,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relinquished to the King of Sericana.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With Mandricardo’s arms, his other weed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was to Rogero given, and given with these</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was warlike Brigliador, whom on the mead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando left, distraught with his disease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Agramant Rogero gave the steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well knowing how that goodly gift would please.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more of this: parforce my strain returns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her that vainly for Rogero burns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant’s torment have I to recount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While for the courier damsel she did stay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With tidings of her love to Alban’s Mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her Hippalca measured back her way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She of Frontino first and Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next of good Rogero had to say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How to the fount anew he had addrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His way, with Richardetto and the rest;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And how the Child, in rescue of the steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had gone with her to find the paynim rude;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And weened to have chastized his foul misdeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from a woman took Frontino good.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how the youth’s design did ill succeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the king had other way pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The reason too why to Mount Alban’s hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero had not come, at full she told;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And fully she to Bradamant exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What to excuse himself Rogero said:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She after drew the letter from her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith entrusted she had thither sped:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With visage which more care than hope confest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paper Bradamant received and read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, but that she expected to have seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s self, more welcome would have been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To find herself with written scroll appaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In good Rogero’s place, whom she attends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marred her fair visage; which such fear portrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Despite and sorrow as her bosom rends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ten times the page she kisses, while the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As oft to him who writes her heart commends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tears alone which trickle from her eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Keep it from kindling at her burning sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Four times, nay six, she that epistle read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And willed moreover that as many more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The message by that damsel should be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who word and letter to Mount Alban bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while unceasing tears the lady shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, I believe, would ever have given o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save by the hope consoled, that she anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should briefly her beloved Rogero view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero’s word was pledged for his return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When fifteen days or twenty were gone by:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So had he after to Hippalca sworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding her boldly on his faith rely.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“From accidents that chance at every turn”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Cried Bradamant) “what warranty have I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas!⁠—and such are commonest in war⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That none the knight’s return for ever bar?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas! alas! Rogero, that above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myself hast evermore been prized by me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would have thought thou more than me could’st love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Any, and most thy mortal enemy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou helpest where to punish would above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And harm’st where thou should’st help; nor do I see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou as worthy praise or blame regard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such tardiness to punish and reward.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I know not if thou knowest⁠—the stones know⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How by Troyano was thy father slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet Troyano’s son, against his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou would’st defend, and keep from harm or stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such vengeance upon him do’st thou bestow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And do his vengers, as their meed obtain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I, descended of his stock, should be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The martyr of the mortal cruelty?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To her Rogero, in his absence, said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady these sad words, and more beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamenting aye; while her attendant maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor once alone, but often, certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The stripling would observe his faith, and prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her⁠—who could do no better⁠—to abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child’s arrival till the time came round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he by promise to return was bound.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The comfort that Hippalca’s words convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Hope, companion of the loving train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant’s fear and sorrow so allay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she enjoys some respite from her pain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This moves her in Mount Alban’s keep to stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever thence that lady stirred again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the day, that day the youthful knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had fixt, who ill observed his promise plight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But in that he his promise ill maintained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No blame upon Rogero should be cast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him one or other cause so long detained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The appointed time parforce he overpast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a sick bed, long time, he, sorely pained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was laid, wherein a month or more he past</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In doubt of death; so deeply him had gored</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile in fight the Tartar monarch’s sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him on the day prefixed the maid attended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other tidings of the youth had read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But those he through Hippalca had commended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that which after Richardetto said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who told, “how him Rogero had defended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And freed the captive pair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-373" id="noteref-373" epub:type="noteref">373</a> to prison led.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tidings, overjoyed, she hears repeat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet blended with some bitter is the sweet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For she had heard as well in that discourse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For might and beauty voiced, Marphisa’s praise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard, how Rogero thither bends his course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together with that lady, as he says,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where in weak post and with unequal force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant the Christian army stays.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such fair companionship the lady lauds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither likes that union nor applauds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor light suspicion has she of that queen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, were Marphisa beauteous, as was said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they together till that time had been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’T were marvel but Rogero loved the maid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet would she not believe; but hung between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hopes and fears, and in Mount Alban stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And close and anxious there, until the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which was to bring her joy or sorrow, lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while Mount Alban’s prince and castellain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, first of that fair brotherhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—I say in honour, not in age, for twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In right of birth before the warrior stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who⁠—as the sun illumes the starry train⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had by his deeds ennobled Aymon’s blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One day at noon, with none beside a page</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To serve him, reached that famous fortilage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hither had good Rinaldo now repaired;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because returning Paris-ward again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Brava, (whither had he often fared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As said, to seek Angelica in vain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He of that pair those evil news had heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Malagigi and his Viviane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How they were to Maganza to be sent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence to Agrismont his way had bent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There, hearing of the safety of that pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of their enemies’ defeat and fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how Rogero and Marphisa were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The authors of their ruin; and how all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His valiant brethren and his cousins are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned, and harboured in Mount Alban’s hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he there embrace the friendly throng</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each hour appears to him a twelvemonth long.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His course to Mont Albano had he ta’en;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, there embracing wife and children dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mother and brethren and the cousins twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(They who were captives to their foe whilere)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A parent swallow seems, amid that train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, with full beak, its fasting youth doth cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With them a day or more the warrior stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then issued forth and others thence conveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Guichard, Duke Aymon’s eldest born, and they,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Richard, Alardo, and Richardet’ combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vivian and Malagigi, wend their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms, the martial paladin behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant, waiting the appointed day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which she, in her desire, too slow opined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigned herself ailing to the brethren true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would she join in arms the banded crew;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, saying that she ailed, most truly said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet ’twas not corporal pain or fever sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was Desire that on her spirit preyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Diseased with Love’s disastrous fit: no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo in Mount Alban’s castle stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him his kinsman’s flower the warrior bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he for Paris journeyed, and how well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He succoured Charles, shall other canto tell.</span>

			<p>
				<span>What sweeter, gladder, state could be possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than falls to the enamoured bosom’s share?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What happier mode of life, what lot more blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than evermore the chains of love to wear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were not the lover, ’mid his joys, distrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that suspicious fear, that cruel care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That martyrdom, which racks the suffering sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That frenzied rage, which jealousy is hight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For by all bitters else which interpose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before enjoyment of this choicest sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love is augmented, to perfection grows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And takes a finer edge; to drink and eat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hunger and thirst the palate so dispose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And flavour more our beverage and our meat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feebly that wight can estimate the charms</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of peace, who never knew the pain of arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That which the heart aye sees, though undiscerned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of human eye, we can support in peace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him long absent, to his love returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A longer absence is but joy’s increase.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Service may be endured, though nought is earned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the hope of guerdon does not cease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For worthy service in the end is paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit its wages should be long delayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scorn, and repulse, and finally each pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of suffering love, his every martyrdom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through recollection, make us entertain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Delights with greater rapture, when they come.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if weak mind be poisoned by that bane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That filthy pest, conceived in Stygian home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though joy ensue, with all its festive pleasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wretched lover ill his comfort measures.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This is that cruel and envenomed wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where neither salve nor portion soothes the smart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor figure made by witch, nor murmured sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor star benign observed in friendly part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor aught beside by Zoroaster found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inventor as he was of magic art.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell wound, which, more than every other woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes wretched man despair, and lays him low!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O! cruel wound! incapable of cure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflicted with such ease on lover’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less by false suspicion than by sure!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O wound! whose pangs so wofully molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They reason and our better wit obscure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from it natural bent our judgment wrest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wound, which against all reason didst destroy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel of Dordona’s every joy!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I speak not of what fatal mischief wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippalca’s and the brother’s bitter blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of fell and cruel tidings brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some few days after; for the former woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weighed with this other, was a thing of nought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This after some digression will I show:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first Rinaldo’s feats I must declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with his troop to Paris made repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The following day they met a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards evening, with a lady by his side;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-374" id="noteref-374" epub:type="noteref">374</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sable his shield, and sable was his gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose ground a bar of silver did divide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As foremost, and of seeming force, the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young Richardetto to the joust defend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, prompt for battle, wheeled his courser round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for the tourney took sufficient ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Between those knights no further parley past:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more question, charged the martial two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo with the friendly troop stood fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And looked to see what issue would ensue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Him from his saddle will I quickly cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If firm the footing, and mine arm prove true;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within himself young Richardetto cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that encounter ends in other wise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him underneath the vizor’s sight offends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger champion, of the sable weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With force so fell, that he the youth extends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above two lances’ length beyond his steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly to venge the knight Alardo wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But falls himself astounded on the mead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore handled, and unhorsed by such a stroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His buckler in the cruel shock is broke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His lance Guichardo levelled, when he spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outstretched upon the field the brethren two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although “Halt, halt,” (renowned Rinaldo cried,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For this third course to me is justly due:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he as yet his helmet had not tied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that Guichardo to the combat flew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He kept his seat no better than the twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith, like them, extended on the plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All to be foremost in the joust contend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Richardo, Malagigi, Viviane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to their strife Rinaldo puts an end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shows himself in arms before the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saying, “ ’Tis time that we to Paris wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For us too long the tourney will detain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I expect till each his course has run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ye are all unseated, one by one.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake the knight, yet spake not in a tone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be o’erheard in what he inly said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thus foul scorn would to the rest have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both now had wheeled, and fierce encounter made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the career Rinaldo was not thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who all the banded kinsmen much outweighed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their spears like brittle glass to pieces went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not an inch the champions backward bent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The chargers such a rough encounter made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That on his crupper sank each staggering horse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s rose so quick, he might be said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarcely to interrupt his rapid course:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger’s broke his spine and shoulder-blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other shocked him with such desperate force.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When his lord sees him slain, he leaves his seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in an instant springs upon his feet;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to his foe, that having wheeled anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached with hand unarmed, the warrior cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Sir, to the goodly courser whom ye slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, whenas he lived, he was my pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem, I ill should render honour due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thus unvenged by my good arm he died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so fall on, and do as best ye may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For we parforce must meet in new assay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him Rinaldo, “If we for thy horse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have to contend in fight, and nought beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Take comfort, for I ween that with no worse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou, in his place, by me shalt be supplied.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Thou errest if thou deem’st his loss the source</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of my regret” (the stranger knight replied);</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But I, since thou divinest not my speech,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee my meaning will more plainly teach.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I should esteem it were a foul misdeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless I proved thee also with the brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, if thou in this other dance succeed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better or worse than me, would understand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, as it please, afoot or on thy steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Attack me, so it be with arms in hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am content all vantage to afford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such my desire to try thee with the sword!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not long Rinaldo paused: he cried, “I plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My promise not to balk thee of the fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for I deem thou art a valiant knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lest thou umbrage take at mine array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These shall go on before, nor other wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside a page, to hold my horse, shall stay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So spake Mount Alban’s lord; and to his band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wend their way the warrior gave command.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To that king paladin with praise replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger peer; alighting on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo to the valet, at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Consigned the goodly steed Bayardo’s rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when his banner he no longer spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now widely distant with the warrior’s train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His buckler braced, his biting faulchion drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the field defied the knight anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now each other they in fight assail:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never seen a feller strife in show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither believes his foeman can avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long, in that fierce debate, against his blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when they knew, well neighed in doubtful scale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they were fitly matched, for weal or woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They laid their fury and their pride apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for their vantage practised every art.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their cruel and despiteous blows resound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Re-echoing wide, what time the valiant twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With cantlets of their shields now strew the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now with their faulchions sever plate and chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet more behoves to parry than to wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If either knight his footing would maintain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the first fault in fence, by either made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will with eternal mischief be appaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One hour and more than half another, stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knights in battle; and the golden sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already was beneath the tumbling flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the horizon veiled with darkness dun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet had they reposed, nor interlude</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been, since that despiteous fight begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt these, whom neither ire nor rancour warms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But simple thirst of fame excites to arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo in himself revolving weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was the stranger knight, so passing stout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That not alone him bravely had gainsaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But oft endangered in that deadly bout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And has so harassed with his furious blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He of its final issue stands in doubt</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—He that the strife was ended would be fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that his knightly honour took no stain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The stranger knight, upon the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As little of his valiant foeman knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in that lord Mount Alban’s chief descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In warfare so renowned all countries through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And upon whom, with such small cause defied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His faulchion he in deadly combat drew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was assured he could not have in fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Experience of a more redoubted wight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He gladly would be quit of the emprize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He undertook to venge his courser’s fall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, could he, without blame, a mean devise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fain withdraw from that disastrous brawl.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So overcast already were the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their cruel strokes well nigh fell harmless all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both blindly strike; more blindly yet those lords</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Parry the stroke, who scarce discern their swords.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He of Mount Alban is the first to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“They should not combat darkling, on the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But should their duel till such time delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As slow Arcturus should have turned his wain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And adds,) “as safely as himself might stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foe in his pavilion, of his train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As duly tended, honoured, and well seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he in any place had ever been.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To pray him has Rinaldo little need:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He courteously accepts him for his host;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither the united warriors speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where lies Mount Alban’s troop in chosen post.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his attendant squire a goodly steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sumptuous housings gorgeously embossed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo takes, with tempered sword and spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these bestows upon the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For Montalbano’s lord the stranger guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The baron recognised, with whom he came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, before they reached their place of rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin had chanced himself to name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (for they brethren were) with love opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His tenderness him wholly overcame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And touched with kind affection, at his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his full eyes the tears of pleasure start.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Guido the savage was that cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, with Marphisa leagued, the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet, and the sons of Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long sailed the sea, as I erewhile have said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From earlier meeting with his kindred dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Pinnabel, the felon knight, delayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seized by that traitor, and by him detained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To enforce the wicked law he had ordained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sir Guido, when he knew his host to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, famed above each famous knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he had burned with more desire to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than ever blind man covets the lost light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In rapture cries, “What fortune tempted me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With you, my lord, to strive in deadly fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom long I have beloved, and love, whose worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I prize above all dwellers upon earth?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Me on the distant bank of Euxine’s flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I Guido am yclept) Constantia bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conceived of the illustrious seed and good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of generous Aymon, as ye likewise are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To visit you and my bold brotherhood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is the occasion, hither I repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, where to honour you I had in thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I see my coming has but mischief wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But that I neither ye nor the others knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must for so foul a fault be my excuse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if I can amend it, bid me do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whate’er thou wilt, nor ought will I refuse.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, on this part and that, between the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of interchanged embraces there was truce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Take you no farther thought upon your side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The battle to excuse,” Rinaldo cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For in complete assurance that you are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A real offset of our ancient tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You could no better testimony bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the tried valour which in you we see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If your demeanour more pacific were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We ill should have believed your ancestry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since neither lion from the doe proceeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor fearful pigeon, hawk or eagle breeds.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While neither they through talk their journey stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither through speed abate their talk, those two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reached the pavilions where the kinsmen lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There good Rinaldo, crying to his crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That this was Guido, whom so many a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They had impatiently desired to view,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much pleased the friendly troop; and, at his sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All like his father deemed the stranger knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I will not tell what welcome to the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made Richardet, Alardo, and those twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What Malagigi, what Sir Aldigier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gallant Vivian, of that kindred train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What every captain, every cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What Guido spake, what they replied again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I for conclusion of my tale will say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was well greeted of the whole array.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ever, I deem, good Guido would have been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dear to his brethren bold; but welcomed more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was now the valiant knight, and better seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That at another time, as needed sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the sun, garlanded with radiance sheen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upraised his visage from the watery floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Guido and his kinsmen, in a band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath Rinaldo’s banner took their stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So one day and another prick the train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they to Paris’ leaguered gates are nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce ten miles distant, on the banks of Seine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, as good Fortune wills it, they descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon and Aquilant, the two that stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their virtuous armour with a different dye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sable was Aquilant’s, white Gryphon’s, weed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good Olivier’s and Sigismonda’s seed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In parley were they by a damsel stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor she of mean condition to behold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in a snowy samyte was arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vesture edged about with list of gold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Graceful and fair; although she was dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And down her visage tears of sorrow rolled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with such mien and act her speech enforced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed of some high matter she discoursed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Guido them, they gallant Guido knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with the pair had been few days before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to Rinaldo; “Behold those! whom few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In valour and in prowess go before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if they join your banner, against you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feebly will stand the squadrons of the Moor.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo vouched what valiant Guido told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How either champion was a warrior bold.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor them he less had recognized at sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because (such was the usage of the pair)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One by a vest all black, and one all white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knows, and by the ornaments they wear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brethren know as well Mount Alban’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And give the warlike kinsmen welcome fair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They both embrace Rinaldo as a friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of their ancient quarrel make an end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They⁠—erst at feud and with sore-hate possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through Truffaldino<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-375" id="noteref-375" epub:type="noteref">375</a>⁠—(which were long to say)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each other with fraternal love carest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now putting all their enmity away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo next Sir Sansonet addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who somewhat later joined that fair array;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (knowing well his force and mighty thew)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Received the cavalier with honour due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she, that gentle damsel, now more near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds renowned Rinaldo, him she knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Acquainted with each paladin and peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She news which sorely grieve the warrior shows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus begin; “My lord, your cousin dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom its safety Church and Empire owes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland, erewhile so honoured and so sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now roves the world, possest with frantic rage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whence woe, so direful and so strange, ensued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot by me to you be signified:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw on earth his sword and armour strewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doffed by that peer, and scattered far and wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I a pious knight and courteous viewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those arms collecting upon every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, in the guise of trophy, to a tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fastened that fair and pompous canoply.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But from the trophied stem the sword withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The son of Agrican that very day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou mayst conceive what mischief may ensue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Charles and to the christened host’s array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From loss of Durindana, if anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The infidels that goodly blade should sway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good Brigliador as well, who roved, forsaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About those arms, was by the paynim taken.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Few days are past, since I in shameful wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw Roland, running naked in his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sending forth piteous shrieks and fearful cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fine, that he is frantic I conclude;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this had I believed, save with these eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That strange and cruel wonder I had viewed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She added next, how from the bridge’s top,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embraced by Rodomont, she saw him drop.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To whosoe’er I deem not Roland’s foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I tell my tale,” (pursued the dame again,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That, of the crowd who hear this cruel woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some one, in pity to his cruel pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May strive the peer in Paris to bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or other friendly place, to purge his brain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well wot I, if such tidings he receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nought unattempted Brandimart will leave.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fair Flordelice was she, the stranger dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That his own self to Brandimart more dear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in pursuit of him to Paris came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That damsel, after, tells the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How hate and strife were blown into a flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between Gradasso and the Tartar peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Roland’s faulchion; fierce Gradasso’s prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When slain in combat Mandricardo lay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By accident, so strange and sad, distrust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo is distraught with ceaseless woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He feels his heart dissolve within his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in the sun dissolves the flake of snow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with unchanged resolve, upon the quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of good Orlando, every where will go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In hopes, if he discover him, to find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some means of cure for his distempered mind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But since his band already had he dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Did him the hand of Heaven or Fortune sway)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He first to put the Saracens to flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And raised the siege of Paris, will assay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But (for it promised vantage) he till night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The assault of their cantonments will delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the third watch or fourth, when heavy sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their senses shall in Lethe’s water steep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His squadron in the wood he placed, and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ambushed, he made them lie the daylight through;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the sun, leaving this nether air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In darkness, to his ancient nurse withdrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fangless serpent now, and goat, and bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other beasts, adorned the heavens anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which by the greater blaze had been concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo moved his silent troop afield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A mile an-end with Aquilant he prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon, Alardo, and Vivian of his race,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guido and Sansonetto, and the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without word spoken, and with stealthy pace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish guard they find with sleep opprest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They slaughter all, nor grant one paynim grace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ere they were by others seen or heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into their midmost camp the squadron spurred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the first charge on that unchristened band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their guard and sentries, taken by surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So broken are by good Rinaldo’s brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No wight is left, save he who slaughtered lies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their first post forced, the paynims understand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No laughing matter is the lord’s emprize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, sleeping and dismayed, their naked swarms</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make small resistance to such warriors’ arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To strike more dread into the Moorish foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mount Alban’s champion, leading the assault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade beat his drums and bade his bugles blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with loud echoing cries his name exalt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He spurs Bayardo, that is nothing slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He clears the lofty barriers at a vault,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trampling down foot, o’erturning cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scatters booth and tent in his career.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is none so bold of all that paynimry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what his stiffened hair stands up on end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing Mount Alban’s and Rinaldo’s cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From earth into the starry vault ascend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him the twin hosts of Spain and Afric fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor time in loading baggage idly spend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will not wait that deadly fury more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to have proved so deeply irks them sore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Guido succeeds; no less their foe pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant sons of warlike Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alardo, Richardet, and the other two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet’s sword and horse a pathway clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well is proved upon that paynim crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The force of Vivian and of Aldigier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus each bestirs himself like valorous knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who follows Clermont’s banner to the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seven hundred men with good Rinaldo speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drawn from Mount Alban and the townships nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—No fiercer erst obeyed Achilles’ lead⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enured to summer and to winter sky:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So stout each warrior is, so good at need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred would not from a thousand fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, better than some famous cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many amid that squadron couch their spears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If good Rinaldo gathers small supplies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From rents or cities, which his rule obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So these he bound by words and courtesies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sharing what he had with his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is none that ever from his service buys</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserter by the bribe of better pay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Montalbano these are left in care,</span>

				<span class="i1">Save pressing need demands their aid elsewhere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Them now in succour of King Charles he stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left with little guard his citadel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the Africans that squadron spurred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That squadron, of whose doughty feats I tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doing by them what wolf on woolly herd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does where Galesus’ limpid waters well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or lion by the bearded goat and rank,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Tidings to Charles Rinaldo had conveyed,</span>

				<span class="i1">To assail, by night, the paynims ill purveyed;”</span>

				<span class="i1">And ready and in arms the king appears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, when his help is needed, comes in aid,</span>

				<span class="i1">With all his peerage, and, beside his peers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brings Monodantes’ son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-377" id="noteref-377" epub:type="noteref">377</a> amid that crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Flordelice the lover chaste and true;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whom by such long and by such tedious way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She sought throughout the realm of France in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here by the cognizance, his old display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afar, by her distinguished from the train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the first sight of her he quits the fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wears a semblance loving and humane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He clipt her round with many a fond caress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kissed a thousand times, or little less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To dame and damsel in that ancient age</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They trusted much, that, in their wandering vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roved, unescorted, many a weary stage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through foreign countries and by hill and plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom they returning hold for fair and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor of their faith suspicion entertain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Brandimart by Flordelice was taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How Roland wandered, of his wits distraught.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Had he such strange and evil tidings heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From other lips, he scarce had these believed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But credited fair Flordelice’s word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whom more wondrous things he had received,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this, as told by other, she averred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This had she seen, and ill could be deceived;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For well as any she Orlando knows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both the when and where that damsel shows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She tells him, “How the perilous bridge’s floor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From cavaliers king Rodomont defends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, on a pompous sepulchre, the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His prisoners’ ravished arms and vest suspends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tells how she saw Orlando, raging sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do fearful deeds,” and her relation ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Describing how the paynim fell reversed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his great peril, in the stream immersed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Brandimart, who the Country loves as dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As man can love a brother, friend, or son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disposed to seek Orlando, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor pain nor peril in the adventure shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till something for the comfort of that peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By wizard’s or by leech’s art be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed as he is, leaps lightly on his steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And takes his way beneath the lady’s lead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thitherward were Orlando she had spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In company the knight and lady made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They daily post till to that bridge they ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Argier’s king maintained, in arms arrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the guard their coming signified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Courser and arms his squires as well conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Brandimart no sooner is at hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Rodomont is armed and at his stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With lofty voice the sovereign of Argier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assorting with his moody rage, ’gan say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“⁠—Whoe’er thou art, sir knight, and whencesoe’er⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought by mistake of purpose or of way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Light from thine horse and doff thy warlike gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To deck this sepulchre, ere thee I slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An offering to its lovely tenant’s spirit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou in thy forced homage have no merit.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Brandimart, at the paynim’s proud discourse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His weapon in the rest, for answer, laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He good Batoldo spurred, his gentle horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the champion with such fury made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As showed that he, for courage and for force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With any warrior in the world had weighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Rodomont as well, with rested spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thundered along the bridge, in fierce career.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The paynim’s courser, ever used to go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that bridge’s fearful pass, where one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell prone parforce into the stream below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Securely to the fierce encounter run:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While, trembling, and irresolute in show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other to the unwonted course is gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quivers the bridge beneath, as it would sink:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Narrow that passage is, unfenced the brink!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With heavy spears, the growth of forest hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saplings rough-hewn, those masters of the just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the perilous bridge encountering sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exchange, on either side, no gentle thrust.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor much their mighty strength or manege-lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avails the steeds; for, prostrate in the dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crumbles each knight and charger in mid-course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whelmed in one fate, the rider and his horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When either steed would nimbly spring from ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the spur galled and gored his bleeding flank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He on that little bridge no footing found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all to narrow was the scanty plank.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence both fall headlong, and the deafening sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Re-echo vaulted skies and grassy bank.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So rang our stream, when from the heavenly sphere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was hurled the sun’s ill-fated charioteer.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-378" id="noteref-378" epub:type="noteref">378</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With all their weight, down hurtled from the steep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Coursers and cavaliers, who sate them well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dived into the river’s darksome deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To search for beauteous nymph in secret cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this the first nor yet the second leap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from the bridge had made that infidel!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, often floundering in its oozy bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well in the soundings of that stream was read.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He where ’tis hand and where ’tis softer knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where shallow is the water, where profound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With breast and flanks above the waves he rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Brandimart assailed on safer ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart, whirling with the current, goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While his steed’s feet the faithless bottom pound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, with his lord, stands rooted in the mud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With risk to both of drowning in the flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whelming them upside-down, the waters flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plunge them in the river’s deepest bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horse is uppermost, the knight below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the bridge looks his lady, sore bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tear employs, and prayer, and suppliant vow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Ah, Rodomont! for love of her, whom dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye worship, do not deed of such despite!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Permit not, sir, the death of such a knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! courteous lord! if e’er you loved withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have pity upon me who love this peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let it suffice that he become thy thrall!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if thou on this stone suspend his gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid whatever spoils adorn the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The best and worthiest will his spoils appear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She ended, and her prayer so well addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It touched, though hard to move, the paynim’s breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Moved by her words, he lent her lover aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So by his courser in the stream immersed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, to his peril sore, was overlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And largely drank, albeit with little thirst.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Rodomont a while his help delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seized the warrior’s sword and helmet first.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him half exhausted from the stream he drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prisoned with that other captive crew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All happiness was in that damsel spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When taken she her Brandimart espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although to see him captive more content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to behold him perish in the tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None but herself she blames for the event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thitherward had been the champion’s guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She having to that faithful warrior shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How at the bridge Orlando she had known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She parts, and has anew already planned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither with good Rinaldo to resort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Guido, Sansonet of doughty hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or other cavalier of Pepin’s court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some warrior good by water and by land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with the Saracen will well assort.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, if no stronger than her baffled knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With better fortune may maintain the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For many days the damsel vainly strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere she encountered any one who bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Semblance of knight, that might afford her aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And free her prisoned lover from the Moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After she long and fruitless search had made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length a warrior crost her way, that wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A richly ornamented vest, whose ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With trunks of cypresses was broidered round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who was that champion, shall be said elsewhere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I to Paris must return, and show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Malagigi and Rinaldo are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victorious o’er the routed Moorish foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To count the flyers were a useless care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or many drowned in Stygian streams below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The darkness rendered Turpin’s labour vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who tasked himself to tell the pagans slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Agramant in his pavilion lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his first sleep awakened by a knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He that the king will be a prisoner, cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Save he with speed betake himself to flight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch looks about him and espies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His paynim bands dispersed in panic fright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked, they far and near desert the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, never halt to snatch the covering shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Uncounselled and confused, the king arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His naked limbs in knightly plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thither Falsiron, the Spaniard, made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grandonio, Balugantes, and their train:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They to the Moorish king the risk displayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of being taken in that press, or slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vouched, “if thence he should in safety fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He well might thank propitious Fortune’s care.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marsilius so, Sobrino so, their fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Express; so, one and all, the friendly band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They warn him “that Destruction is as near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As swift Mount Alban’s lord is nigh at hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if against so fierce a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such a troop, he seeks to make a stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He and his friends in that disastrous strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will surely forfeit liberty or life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But he to Arles and Narbonne may retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such few squadrons as his rule obey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since either is well fortified, and meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warfare to maintain above one day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having saved his person, the defeat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May venge upon the foe, by this delay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His troops may rally quickly in that post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rout in fine King Charles’ conquering host.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant to those lords’ opinion bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though that hard counsel he could ill endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if supplied with wings, towards Arles he went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By roads which offered passage most secure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside safe guides, much favoured his intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His setting out, when all things were obscure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scaping the toils by good Rinaldo spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some twenty thousand of the paynims fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those whom Rinaldo, whom his brethren slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Oliviero’s sons, the valiant twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those who were slaughtered by Mount Alban’s crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The fierce seven hundred, good Rinaldo’s train⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those whom the valiant Sansonet o’erthrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those that in their flight were drowned in Seine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who would count, might count as well what flowers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zephyr and Flora shed, mid April showers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here one conjectures Malagigi bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A part in the alarum of that night:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that he stained the mead with paynim gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor splintered heads; but that the wizard wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Infernal angels, by his magic lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Called from Tartarean caverns into light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose many spears and banners waving wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two kingdoms such as France had scarce supplied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with them such sonorous metal brayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many drums and martial noises sounded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many steeds in that encounter neighed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many cries⁠—with rush of foot confounded⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rose all about, that hill, dale, wood, and glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From distant parts, the deafening din rebounded;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And struck into the Moors such sudden dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They turned and from the field in panic fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their king forgets no, how Rogero lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore wounded, and as yet in evil case.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, with what care they could, he made convey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that dread field, on horse of easy pace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne to the sea by the securest way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They in a bark the suffering warrior place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence commodiously to Arles transport;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither their wasted squadrons make resort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Chased by Rinaldo and King Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred thousand, or well nigh, I ween,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By wood, by mountain, valley, and by plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flying the fury of the Franks are seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More find the passage blocked, and widely stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With crimson what before was white and green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not so Gradasso’s puissant troops was spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who farther from the field had pitched his tent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nay; when he hears it is Mount Alban’s knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom assailed the paynim quarters are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in his heart exults, with such delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, for very joy, leaps here and there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thanks and lauds his God, who him that night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blest with so high a fortune and so rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping to win the horse without a peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bayardo, from the Christian cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gradasso had desired long time before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I think you will have read the tale elsewhere)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To back that courser, which Rinaldo bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Durindana by his side to wear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with a hundred thousand men and more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To France, with this design, had made repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had erewhile to bloody fight defied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even for that good steed, Mount Alban’s pride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hence had that king repaired to the sea-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The place assigned to end their discord fell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all was marred by Malagigi’s lore;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-379" id="noteref-379" epub:type="noteref">379</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, cheating good Rinaldo with a spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sea the champion in a pinnace bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too tedious were the tale at length to tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence evermore Gradasso had opined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle baron was of craven kind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now that Gradasso learns Mount Alban’s peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is he, that storms the camp, in huge delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed, on Alfana leaps the cavalier,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-380" id="noteref-380" epub:type="noteref">380</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And through the pitchy darkness seeks the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erturning all who cross his fierce career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He leaves afflicted and in piteous plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The broken bands of Afric and of France,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All, food alike for his wide-wasting lance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He seeks the paladin, now here now there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Echoing his name as loud as he can shout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thitherward inclines his courser, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bodies are most thickly strown about.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length encounter, sword to sword, the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For broken are alike their lances stout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which shivering in their hands, had flown upright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And smote the starry chariot of the Night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When King Gradasso recognized the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not by the blazoned bearing of his shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But by Bayardo⁠—by that horrid blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which made him seem sole champion of the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to reproach the knight was nothing slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of unworthy action him appealed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he had not kept his ground and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile appointed for the fierce assay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Belike thou hoped,” (said he of Sericane,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If for that time my vengeance thou couldst fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We should not meet in this wide world again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But we are met, thou seest, anew; and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be sure, though thou shouldst seek the Stygian reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or be from earth translated to the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will hunt thee, save that courser thou forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be it through heaven above or hell below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dost thou, as matched with me mistrust thy force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And that thou wert ill paired was seen whilere,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more esteemest life than fame, a course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remains, which thee may from thy peril clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou, if thou in peace resign the horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May’st live, if life be deemed so passing dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But live afoot, unmeriting a steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That dost by chivalry such foul misdeed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Guido the savage, as he spake, was nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Richardetto; and the warlike twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandished alike their trenchant swords on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To teach more wit to him of Sericane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But them Rinaldo stopt with sudden cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor brooked that he should injury sustain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Am I too weak,” (he cried,) “without your aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To answer him that dares my deeds upbraid?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then to the pagan thus; “Gradasso hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wilt thou listen, thou shalt understand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I will prove it manifest and clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I came to seek thee out upon the strand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards on thee will made appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The truth of all I say with arms in hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know then thou liest, if e’er with slanderous speech</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou taxest me with aught in knighthood’s breach.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But warmly I beseech thee, that before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The battle be, thou fully comprehend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My just excuses, that thou may’st no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me for my failure wrongly reprehend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next for Bayardo, as agreed of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis my desire that we afoot contend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even as ordained by thee, in desert place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone in knightly duel, face to face.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Courteous was Sericana’s cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For generous bosoms aye such practise use)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is content to listen to the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he his breach of promise will excuse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him he seeks the river side, and here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In simple words what chanced Rinaldo shews:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the true history removes the veil,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cites all Heaven to witness to his tale.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next calls upon the son of Buovo, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is of that history informed aright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, from point to point, relates anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor more nor less rehearsed) the magic sleight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thus Rinaldo; “What I warrant true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By witness, I with arms in single fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For better proof, will vouch upon thy crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both now and ever, as it likes thee best.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king of Sericane, as loth to leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The second quarrel for the former breach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though doubtful how that tale he should receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes in good part the bold Rinaldo’s speech.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not, as upon the former battle’s eve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They choose their ground on Barcellona’s beach:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But on the morn ensuing, and, fast by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A neighbouring fountain, will the question try.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither Rinaldo will the steed convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There to be placed in common, ’twixt the two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If good Gradasso take his foe or slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wins Bayardo without more ado.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if Gradasso fails in that affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Should he be slain, or else for mercy sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A prisoner to Mount Alban’s valiant lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo shall possess the virtuous sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With mighty marvel and with greater pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin from Flordelice (as shown)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had heard how troubled was his cousin’s brain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the damsel’s lips as well had known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he his arms had scattered on the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heard the quarrel which from thence had grown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fine, how King Gradasso had the brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which won such thousand palms in Roland’s hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they so agreed, Gradasso made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither where, camped apart, his servants lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit warmly by Rinaldo prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would with him in his pavillion stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim king in armour was arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so the paladin, by break of day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the destined fount came either lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field of combat for the horse and sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It seemed Rinaldo’s friends were all in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dreaded much, before it was begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The issue of the fight their cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should wage against Gradasso, one to one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much force, much daring, and much skill appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that fierce king; and since of Milo’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goodly sword was to his girdle tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All cheeks looked pale upon Rinaldo’s side;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And Malagigi more than all the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore doubted the event which would ensue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He willingly himself would have addressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To disappoint the destined fight anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fears if he that deadly strife arrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s utter enmity to rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet wroth with him upon that other score,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he conveyed the warrior from the shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let others nourish idle grief and fears!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo wends afield secure and gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping <em>that</em> shame, which to the knight appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too foul to be endured, to wipe away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that of Altafoglia and Poictiers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He may for ever silence the missay.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-381" id="noteref-381" epub:type="noteref">381</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Boldly, and in his heart secure to win</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That battle’s honour, wends the paladin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When now from either side those warriors meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh at the same time at the fountain-side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So in all points the pair each other greet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With countenance, so kind, so satisfied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem by kindred and by friendship sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo and Gradasso were allied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But how they after closed in fierce affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I till another season shall delay.</span>

					<span>To her that does for her Rogero stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tidings are brought which irk the damsel sore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fair Marphisa caused the youth’s delay;</span>

					<span class="i1">She bent to slay her, grieving evermore,</span>
					<br/>

			<p>
				<span>I recollect that I was bound to sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I promised so, but it escaped my mind)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a suspicion, fraught with suffering</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Bradamant of more displeasing kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made by keener and more venomed sting</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than caused that other wound, wherewith she pined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, hearing Richardet his news impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had pierced her breast, and preyed upon her heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So was I bound to sing, but I begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another song, Rinaldo crossed my way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then those deeds by savage Guido done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kept me employed and caused no small delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so from subject I to subject run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I forgot of Bradamant to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I now remember, and will tell you, ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You of Rinaldo or Gradasso hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But it behoves, ere more of these be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should awhile of Agramant discourse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had from that night’s raging fire conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Arles, the remnant of his scattered force:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since to unite his troops, and furnish aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And victual, ’twas a place of much resource,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seated upon a river, nigh the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Spain in front and Africa before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With horse and foot, of good or evil sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marsilius throughout Spain their loss repairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And each armed back in Barcellona’s port,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Furnished through love or fear, for sea prepares.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moor to council daily calls his court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor care nor cost the watchful monarch spares:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile sore taxes and repeated cess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All Africa’s o’erburdened towns oppress.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He offers Rodomont, if to his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will return, but offers him in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renowned Almontes’ daughter, as a bride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cousin she, her portion Oran’s reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He lures not from his bridge that knight of pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has so many sells, such plate and chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Collected there, from cavaliers o’erthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As serve to hide the monumental stone,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa would not such a course pursue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, the redoubted damsel hearing said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That Agramant, subdued by Charles’s crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—His choicest warriors taken, chased, or dead⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Arles was sheltered with his broken few,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, unbidden by the monarch, sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prompt to assist him with her friendly blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And proffered purse and person in his aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As a free gift to him the martial fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello bore, nor had she done him wrong.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, for ten days and nights, to swing in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had sorely feared, from lofty gallows hung:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But seeing him unhelped by force or prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of any one amid the paynim throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thought foul scorn to stain her generous hands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such base blood, and loosed the losel’s bands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She pardoned every ancient injury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him to Agramant in Arles conveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well may you fancy with what joy and glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch greeted her who brought him aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in Brunello’s fate wills all shall see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In what esteem he holds that warlike maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he in earnest does upon her foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What fierce Marphisa menaced but in show.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hangman hung his corpse in desert field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The craving vulture and the crow to feed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, that erewhile had been his shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the noose that caitiff would have freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven’s justice willed, now lay with wound unhealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could assist the craven in his need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when the news were known, the knot was tied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that Brunello, unassisted, died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while does good duke Aymon’s daughter mourn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because those twenty days so slowly trail:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Which term elapsed⁠—Rogero should return,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be received into her church’s pale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Time halts not more with him to foreign bourne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exiled, with prisoner pent in noisome jail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pines the poor wretch for liberty and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or his loved land, desired and gladsome sight!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Aye sick with hope deferred, the expecting maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Phoebus’ steeds were foundered one while deemed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then that his wheels were out of frame, so stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the wonted term, his chariot seemed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet longer than <em>that</em> day when Faith delayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun, which on the righteous Hebrew beamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or than <em>that</em> night Alcides was conceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She every day and every night believed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How oft of dormouse, badger, or of bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heavy slumber would she fain partake!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she that time in sleep would waste and wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor such prolonged repose desired to break;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor wished the damsel any sound to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until Rogero’s voice should her awake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not alone is this beyond her power;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She cannot close her eyes one single hour.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She here and there, throughout the livelong night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tosses and turns, nor ever finds repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still, impatient for the dawn of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From time to time she to her window goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see if Tithon’s spouse the lily white</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet scatters mingled with the crimson rose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less desires the damsel, when ’tis morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see the golden stars the heaven adorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When, saving some four days, the term was ended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appointed for the youthful warrior’s stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, full of hope, the messenger attended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From hour to hour, that should arrive, and say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Behold Rogero comes;” and oft ascended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A turret, from whose top she might survey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gay champaign, wood, and, mid the wide expanse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A portion of the road, that led to France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When shining arms at distance she perceives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or any thing that speaks a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis her desired Rogero, she believes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her fair eyes and brows are seen to clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If footman, or unarmed, the maid conceives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It is a courier from the youthful peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though fallacious every hope she feeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another and another aye succeeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And then she arms, and will the warrior meet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the hill descends into the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She finds him not, and to Montalban’s seat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hopes he by other road his way has ta’en.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the design, wherewith she moved her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence, she to her fort returns in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor finds him here nor there; meanwhile expired</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The period whose approach she so desired.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—The period so prefixt o’erpast by one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By two, three, six, by eight, by twenty days⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seeing not her spouse, and tidings none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Receiving of the youth, laments ’gan raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had from snake-haired Furies pity won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In those dark realms that Rhadamanthus sways.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She smote her eyes divine, and bosoms fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She rent the tresses of her golden hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Can it be true?”⁠—(she cried)⁠—“Shall I be fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow one, that strives to hide and fly?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteem a man that has me in disdain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pray him that never hears my suppliant cry?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffer who hates me o’er my heart to reign?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that his lofty virtues holds so high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere need some heaven-born goddess should descend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From realms above, his stubborn heart to bend?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Proud youth! he knows my worship and my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor me will have for lover or for slave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cruel stripling knows what pangs I prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet will not aid me till I am in my grave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let me tell my sorrows, lest they move</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him his perverse and evil will to wave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shunning me like malignant asp, that fears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To change his mood, if he the charmer hears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! Love, arrest this wight who runs so free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outstripping my slow feet, or me install</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the condition whence thou tookest me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as I was, ere thine or other’s thrall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Alas! how vain the hope! that thou shouldst be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever to pity moved by suppliant call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sport, yea feed and live, in streams that rise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the distracted lover’s brimming eyes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, woe is me, alas! and, what can I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save my irrational desire lament?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which makes me soar a pitch so passing high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I reach a region, where my plumes are brent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, unsustained, fall headlong from the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ends my woe; on other flight intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again I imp my wings, again I soar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To flame and fall, tormented evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea; rather of myself should I complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than the desire, to which I bared my breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereby was Reason hunted from her reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all my powers by stronger force opprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus borne from bad to worse, without a rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I cannot the unbridled beast arrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who makes me see I to destruction haste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I more bitterness in death may taste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet, ah! why blame myself? Wherein have I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever offended, save in loving thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wonder was it then that suddenly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman’s feeble sense opprest should be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why fence and guard myself, lest bearing high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wise words, and beauty rare should pleasure me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Most wretched is the mortal that would shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To look upon the visage of the sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Besides that me my destiny entrained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Words, worthy credence, moved me much, that drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A picture of rare happiness, ordained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As meed of this fair unless to ensue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If these persuasive words were false and feigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If famous Merlin’s counsel was untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wrath at the wizard may I well profess;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But cannot therefore love Rogero less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Both Merlin and Melissa have I need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To blame, and shall for ever blame the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, to exhibit suckers of my seed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conjured up spirits from infernal reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with this empty hope my fancy feed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me in perpetual bondage to detain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other cause for this can I suppose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that they grudge me safe and sweet repose.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sorrow the maid so wholly occupies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Room has she none for comfort or for rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, maugre her affliction, Hope will rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And form a lodgement in her harassed breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the damsel’s memory still supplies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s parting words to her addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So makes her, in all seeming facts, despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Await from hour to hour the youthful knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For a month’s space beyond those twenty days</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This hope affords fair Bradamant content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence sorrow not on her so heavy weighs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it would else her harassed soul have shent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, one day that along the road she strays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which she oft to meet Rogero went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hears tidings, that of Hope⁠—last comfort left⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Like every other good) her breast bereft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bound homeward from the hostile camp, where lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant, she met a Gascon knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A prisoner to those paynims, from the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fought nigh Paris was the famous fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel prest him all he knew to say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to the point she covets led the knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Asks of Rogero, on that theme abides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Listens to that, not aught inquires besides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of him a full account did he afford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well acquainted with the court; he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How, matched with Mandricardo, strove that lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And layed the martial king in combat dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how, sore wounded by the Tartar’s sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above a month the stripling kept his bed:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had the stranger here but closed his news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well might his tale the missing knight excuse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But then subjoins the Gascon cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How in the Moorish camp a damsel lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By name Marphisa hight, of beauteous cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold and as skilled in arms of every guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who loves Rogero and to him is dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then the host so rarely sundered spies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That every one, throughout the paynim train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deems that betrothed in wedlock are the twain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And hope, when healed shall be the youthful knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The marriage of those lovers will succeed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For sure) with pleasure and sincere delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those tidings paynim prince and monarch read:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, knowing either’s superhuman might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They augur, from their loins will spring a breed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In little season, which shall pass in worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mightiest race that ever was on earth.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What he rehearsed, the Gascon knight believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor without cause believed the news he bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A rumour universally received</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bruited through the squadrons of the Moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had that notion of their love conceived</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From signs of kindness witnessed evermore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For⁠—good or bad⁠—though from one mouth it flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fame to a boundless torrent quickly grows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That she with him had brought the Paynim aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ne’er was seen without the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first foundation of the rumour layed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what confirmed that fame in every ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was, that she, having from the camp conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thief Brunello (as I sang whilere)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if alone to see Rogero brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had to the camp returned, uncalled, unsought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She solely to the camp had ta’en her way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To visit him that on a sick-bed smarted;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor once alone; but often all the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There passed that maid, and but at eve departed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who gave yet greater cause of her to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That⁠—known as one so haughty and hard-hearted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who all the world despised⁠—she now was grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Benign and humble to the Child alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Bradamant the Gascon’s story heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lady suffered such tormenting pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such cruel woe her inmost bosom stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From falling she preserved herself with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She turned her courser round, without a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed with jealousy and fierce disdain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her all hope the wretched damsel spurns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to her chamber breathing wrath returns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Turned on her face, her body on the bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed as she is, the grieving damsel throws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that the sad lament by sorrow bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May be unheard of any, bites the clothes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so, repeating what the stranger said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To such a pitcher her smothered anguish grows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her plaints no longer able to restrain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vents the maid parforce her piteous pain:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who ever can be trusted? woe is me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All false and cruel well may be esteemed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou, Rogero, false and cruel be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I so pious and so faithful deemed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What foul and felon act, what treachery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ever yet by tragic poet dreamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But will fall short of thine, if thou wilt set</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sum of my desert, against thy debts?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wherefore, Rogero, since no cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mates thee in beauteous form and daring feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since thou in matchless valour hast no peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And none with thee in gentleness compete,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why cannot we, ’mid godlike gifts and clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Allow thee truth, thy graces to complete?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The praise of spotless truth to thee allow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To which all other virtues yield and bow?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Knowest thou not, without it, worthless are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All gentle bearing and all martial might?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As there is nothing, howsoever fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That can be seen without the aid of light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Easily mightest thou a maid ensnare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lord as thou was, and idol in her sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her with thy honied words thou might’st have won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To deem that cold and darksome was the sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cruel, what sin can trouble thee, if thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do’st not her murder who loved <em>thee</em> repent?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If held so lightly be a breach of vow⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath what burden will thy heart be bent?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What treatment will thine adversary know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If one who loves like me thou so torment?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Justice is none in heaven, I well may say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Heaven its vengeance for my wrongs delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If of all human sins of deepest dye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be fell ingratitude; if doomed to smart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, the fairest angel of the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was banished into foul and darksome part;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If mighty sins for mighty vengeance cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where due atonement cleanses not the heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beware lest thou beneath such vengeance groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ingrate! that wouldest not thy sin atone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Cruel Rogero, I of theft, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All other sins, may justly thee arraign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou my heart has ravished form my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Of this offence I will not, I complain⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, having made it mine, that thou defied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All right, and took away thy gift again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Restore it; well thou know’st what pains requite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sin, who keeps what is another’s right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou hast left <em>me</em>, Rogero; <em>thee</em> to leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! I neither will nor power possess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But will and power have I my life to reave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scape from this o’erwhelming wretchedness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To die at strife with thee alone I grieve:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, had the gods so pleased my lot to bless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to require my life, when loved of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never so welcome had been death to me.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Resolved to die, ’twas so the damsel cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And starting from her bed, by passion warmed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her left breast her naked sword applied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then recollected she was wholly armed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile her better Spirit, at her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these persuasive words her fury charmed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O lady, born to such illustrious name!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would’st thou conclude thy life with such foul shame?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Were it not better to the field to go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where aye thy breath with glory may be spent?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There, should Rogero chance to lay thee low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to have slain thee haply may repent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, should his faulchion deal the mortal blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What death could ever yield thee more content?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reason it were thou should’st by him be slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who dooms thee living to such passing pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Haply of that Marphisa, too, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou die, thou yet may deadly vengeance take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with dishonest love and treacherous lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did thy beloved Rogero’s fealty shake.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This seemed to please the mournful lady more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than her first thought; and she forthwith bade make</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mantle for her arms, which should imply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her desperation and desire to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The vest is of that colour which is spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In leaf, when gray and yellow are at strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When it is gathered from the branch, or dried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is the green blood, that was it’s parent’s life.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embroidered is the surcoat’s outer side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With stems of cypress which disdain the knife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which shoot not, when by biting steel laid low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A habit well according with her woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She took the courser that was wont to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho, and with him the lance of gold,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady took the lance, but nothing guessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the stupendous virtue it possessed.</span>

				<span class="i1">And Montferrant’s and Clermont’s towers appear:</span>

				<span class="i1">When she, a lady fair, of semblance kind,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three knights were nigh, and⁠—at the pommel hung⁠—</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That lady to the king of France” (replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The squire) “is sent upon an embassy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From <b>The Lost Isle</b>, which lies mid seas that roll</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their restless waves beyond the northern pole.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Some <b>The Lost Isle</b>, some Iceland call the reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof a royal lady fills the throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose charms (before those charms all beauties wane)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are such as Heaven had dealt to her alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The shield you see she sends to Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with the pact and purpose plainly shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should confer it on the knight, whose worth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is, in his judgment, fairest upon earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She, as she deems herself (and it is true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She <em>is</em> the fairest of all womankind),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cavalier, that should in heart and thew</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In France, in royal Charles’s famous court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel hopes to find the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in a thousand feats of high report</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has shown that he excels each puissant peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All three are monarchy who the dame escort,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surpast in martial praise by few or none.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“These three, whose kingdoms at some distance lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet the least distant lie from the <b>Lost Isle</b>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Because few mariners its shore descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As little known, that island so they style),</span>

				<span class="i1">Wooed and yet woo her for a wife, and vie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In valour, and, to win the lady’s smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Illustrious deeds have done, which Fame shall sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Heaven shall circle in its wonted round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet she not these will wed, nor cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That does not, as she deems, all else excell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘Lightly I hold your proof of valour here,’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Those northern monarchs was she wont to tell)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘And if, like sun amid the stars, one peer</span>

				<span class="i1">But therefore hold him not, in fierce alarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of living men the bravest knight at arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘To Charlemagne, whom I esteem and hold</span>

				<span class="i1">As wisest among reigning kings, by me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be dispatched a costly shield of gold,</span>

				<span class="i1">Amid the martial ranks of chivalry.</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will be governed by that king’s award.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘If when King Charles the buckler shall receive</span>

				<span class="i1">Do they to his or other court belong.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him for my spouse and lord will I confess.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Moved by these stirring speeches, hither hie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that wide-distant sea, those monarchs bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved to win the buckler, or to die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath his hand who has that shield of gold.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant ponders much the squire’s reply:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He give his horse the head⁠—his story told⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plies him so with restless heel and hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He overtakes the damsel’s distant band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After him gallops not, nor hurries ought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant, who pursues her road at ease:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much evermore evolving in her thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Things that may chance, she finally foresees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That through the buckler by that damsel brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will follow strife and boundless enmities,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid king Charles’s peerage and the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If with that shield he shall reward the best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This grieved the damsel’s heart, but far above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That grief, the former fear her heard did goad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That young Rogero had withdrawn his love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her, and on the warlike queen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-383" id="noteref-383" epub:type="noteref">383</a> bestowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So buried in the thoughts wherewith she strove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was Bradamant, she heeded nor her road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor took she care where, at the close of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find befitting shelter for the night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when from squall, or other chance, a barge</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drives from the river-side, where late it lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under no mariner or pilot’s charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winds and waves at will transport their prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Rabican with Bradamant, at large,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—She musing on Rogero⁠—wends his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thence, by many miles, was distant wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That mind which should her courser’s bridle guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She raised her eyes at last, and saw the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had turned his back on Bocchus’ towers and wall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-384" id="noteref-384" epub:type="noteref">384</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, like a cormorant, his journey done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into his nurse’s lap beheld him fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond Marocco; and for her to run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tree, for shelter from the rising squall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been a foolish thought: for now ’gan blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A blustering wind, which threatened rain or snow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To better speed fair Bradamant aroused</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her courser, yet but little way did ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When with his flock, which on the champaign browsed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving the fields, a shepherd she espied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him where, well or ill, she might be housed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—With many instances the maid applied⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For never house could such ill shelter yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that in rain ’twere worse to lodge afield.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To her the shepherd said, “I know of none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereto I could direct you, near at hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least six leagues are distant all, but one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Named <b>Tristram’s Tower</b>, throughout the neighbouring land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not to all men is the door undone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For it behoves that they, with lance in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achieve their footing first and the defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to be lodged within its walls pretend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If there be room within, to stranger knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The castellain gives kindly welcome there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But is a lodging claimed by other wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To joust with all new comers makes him swear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If none, he need not move; but arms and fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He must what stranger thither shall repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he that worst his warlike arms shall ply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must wander forth beneath the naked sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If two, three, four, or more, seek shelter, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That first arrive, in peace their quarters take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who follows, has a harder game to play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For war upon those many must he make.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, if one only in that mansion stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with those two, or more, a lance must break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then with as many others as succeed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus he what strength he has shall sorely need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As well, if wife or maid seek that repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Is she alone, is she accompanied),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards another, the most fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is housed; that other must without abide.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant asked the kindly shepherd where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That castle stood; and he with signs replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as words, and pointed with his hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, five or six miles wide, the tower did stand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though Rabican’s good paces merit praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hurry him the damsel had no skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By those so passing foul and broken ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(By season somewhat rainy rendered ill)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, as to reach the tower, ere Night o’erlays</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The world, whose every nook dark shadows fill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, that lady finds the portal barred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And “that she seeks a lodging,” tells the guard.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He answers, “that the place is occupied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By dame and knight already housed, who, met</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About the fire, in that chill evening tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wait till their supper be before them set.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him that maid; “The board is not supplied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem, for them, unless the meal be eat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, say I wait their coming.” (she pursues)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who know and will observe your castle’s use.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The guard his message bore, where at their ease</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reposed the weary cavaliers; his tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not overlikely was those kings to please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For cold and peevish blew the wintry gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now fast fell the rain; yet, forced to seize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their arms, they slowly don the martial mail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest remain within; while they proceed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the damsel, but with little speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three cavaliers they were, of might so tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few champions but to them in prowess yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The same that she that very day, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courier maid, encountered in the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They that in Iceland boasted, in their pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bear away from France the golden shield:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who (for they had the martial maid outrode)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived before her at that lord’s abode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In feats of arms few warriors were more stout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she besure will be among those few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, that on no account will wait without,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fasting and wet, night’s weary watches through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within from window and from lodge, the rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Look forth, and will the joust by moonlight view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which streams from underneath a covering cloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit the furious rain beats fast and loud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such transport as the longing gallant cheers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About to seize the stolen fruits of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, after long delay, the listener hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bolt within its socket softly move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such transport cheered her, of those cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prowess and the pith afire to prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When now the opened portals she descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drawbridge dropt, and issuing knights espied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she beheld, how, of the drawbridge clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those knights, together or scarce sundered, came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She took her ground; and next in fierce career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With flowing bridle, drove the furious dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Levelling against those kings that virtuous spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her cousin’s gift which never missed its aim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose touch each warrior must unseat parforce;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea Mars, should Mars contend in mortal course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king of Sweden, foremost of those knights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In falling too is foremost of the train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such surpassing force his helmet smites</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That spear, which never yet was couched in vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gothland’s good king next meets the maid, and lights</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With feet in air, at distance on the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The third (unhorsed by Aymon’s beauteous daughter)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Half buried lies in mire and marshy water.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When at three strokes she had unhorsed them all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lighting with head on earth and heels in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Retiring from the field, she sought the Hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In search of lodging; but, ere harboured there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To issue forth, at whosoever’s call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is, by the warder’s hest, obliged to swear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lord who well had weighed her famous feats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel with surpassing honour greets.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So does by her the lady, that erewhile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had thither journeyed, with those monarchs three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As I related, sent from the <b>Lost Isle</b>.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To France’s king, upon an embassy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kind as she is and affable of style,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She renders back the stranger’s courtesy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rises to welcome her with smiling air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the fire conducts that warlike fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Bradamant unarms, and first her shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after puts her polished casque away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A caul of shining gold, wherein concealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clustering close, her prisoned tresses lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She with the helmet doffs; and now revealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(While the long locks about her shoulders play,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lovely damsel by that band is seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No fiercer in affray than fair of mien.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when the stage’s curtain is uprolled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid thousand lamps, appears the mimic scene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Adorned with arch and palace, pictures, gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And statues; or, as limpid and serene</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun his visage, glorious to behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unveils, emerging from a cloudy screen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So when the lady doffs her iron case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All paradise seems opened in her face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already so well-grown and widely spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were the bright tresses which the hermit shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, gathered in a knot, behind her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though shorter than their wont, the damsel wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, that castle’s master, plainly read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Who often had beheld her face before)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That this was Bradamant; and now he paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet higher honours to the martial maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With modest and with mirthful talk this while,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seated about the fire, they feed the ear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in this way the weary time beguile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they are heartened with more solid cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If new or ancient were his castle’s style,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Bradamant asks the courteous cavalier)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“By whom begun, and how it took its rise?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus that castellain to her replies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When Pharamond of France possessed the throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His son, prince Clodion, had a mistress rare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And damsel in that ancient age was none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More graceful, beauteous, or more debonair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So loved of Pharamond’s enamoured son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he lost sight no oftener of the fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Io’s shepherd of his charge whilere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For jealous as enamoured was the peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her in this mansion, which his sire bestowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He kept, and rarely issued from his rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him were lodged ten cavaliers, allowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through France to be the boldest and the best.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hither, while in this castle he abode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Tristram and a dame their course addrest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom from a furious giant, in her need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short time before that gentle knight had freed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sir Tristram and his lady reached the Hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When now the sun had Seville left behind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They for admission on the porter call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since they for ten miles round no shelter find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Clodion, that loved much, and was withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore jealous, was determined in his mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No stranger in his keep should ever inn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long as that fair lady lodged therein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When, after long entreaties made in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The castellain refused to house the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He said, ‘What supplication cannot gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hope to make thee do in they despite;’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loudly challenged him, with all his train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those ten which he maintained, to bloody fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Offering, with levelled lance and lifted glaive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove Sir Clodion a discourteous knave;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On pact, if he sate fast, and overthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should be the warder, and his warlike rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in that castle should be lodged alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Clodion with his knights remain without.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Against him goes the king of France’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At risk of death, to venge that galling flout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But falls astound; the rest partake his fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the losers Tristram bars the gate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Entering the tower, he finds her harboured there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof I spake, so dear in Clodion’s eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom <b>She</b> had equalled with the loveliest fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nature, so niggard of such courtesies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her Sir Tristram talks, while fell despair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye racks the houseless prince in horrid wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who prays the conquering knight, with suppliant cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to his arms the damsel to deny.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Though she small worth in Tristram’s sight possess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any, saving Yseult, please his sight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-385" id="noteref-385" epub:type="noteref">385</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other dame to love or to caress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The philtre, drunk erewhile, allows the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet, for he would that foul discourteousness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Clodion with a fit revenge requite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cries, ‘I deem it were foul wrong and sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If so such beauty I should shut the door.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And, should Sir Clodion grieve beneath the tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lodge alone, and company demand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although less beautiful, I have with me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fair and youthful damsel, here at hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, I am well content, his mate shall be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And do in all things, as he shall command.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she that is most fair to the most strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseemeth, in all justice should belong.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Shut out all night, the moody Clodion strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Puffing and pacing round his lofty tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if that prince the sentinel had played</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On them, that slept at ease in lordly bower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, sorer far than wind and cold dismayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lovely lady’s loss in Tristram’s power:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, with pity touched, upon the morrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rendered her back, and so relieved his sorrow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Because,’ he said, and made it plain appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Such as he found her, he returned the fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And though for his discourtesy whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clodion had every scorn deserved to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was content with having made the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outwatch the weary night in open air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accepting not that cavalier’s excuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would have thrown on Love his castle’s use.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘For Love should make a churlish nature kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not transform to rude a gentle breast.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Tristram hence was gone, not long behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remained the enamoured prince who changed his rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first he to a cavalier consigned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tower; whereof that baron he possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On pact, that he and his in the domain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Henceforth this usage ever should maintain;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That cavalier of greater heart and power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should in this hall be harboured without fail:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They that less worthy were should void the tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seek another inn, by hill or dale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fine, that law was fixt, which to this hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endures, as you have seen;” while so his tale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Bradamant recounts that castle’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sewer with savoury meats has heaped the board.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the great hall that plenteous board was laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(None fairer was in all the world beside)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then came where those beauteous ladies stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And them, with torches lit, did thither guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On entering, Bradamant the room surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, that other fair, on every side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who as they gaze about the gorgeous hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filled full of picture, mark each storied wall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So beauteous are the figures, that instead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of eating, on the painted walls they stare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit of meat they have no little need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who wearied sore with that day’s labour are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With grief the sewer, with grief the cook takes heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How on the table cools the untasted fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, there is one amid the crowd, who cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“First fill your bellies, and then feast your eyes.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The guests were placed, and now about to eat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When suddenly bethought that castellain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To house two damsels were a thing unmeet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One lady must dislodge, and one remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fairest stay, and she least fair retreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where howls the wind, where beats the pattering rain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because they separate came, ’tis ordered so;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One lady must remain, one lady go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lord some matrons of his household crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calls, with two elders, in such judgments wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He marks the dames, and bids them of the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Declare which is most beauteous in their eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all, upon examination due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cry, Aymon’s daughter best deserves the prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vouch as she in might those kings outweighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less in beauty she surpassed the maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warder cries to that Islandic dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of her sentence has a shrewd suspicion,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O lady, let it be no cause of blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we observe our usage and condition;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek some other rest must be thine aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, by our universal band’s admission,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though unadorned that martial maid be seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou canst not match her charms and lovely mien.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in a moment’s time a cloud obscure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Steams from the bottom of some marshy dale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the sun’s visage, late so bright and pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mantles all over with its dingy veil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that poor damsel, sentenced to endure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without, the pelting shower and blustering gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is seen to change her cheer, and is no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fair and mirthful maid she was before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The maid turns pale, and all her colour flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who dreads so stern a sentence to obey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But generous Bradamant, in prudent guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who could not bear to see her turned away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cried to that baron, “Partial and unwise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your judgment seems, as well all judgments may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein the losing party has not room</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To plead before the judge pronounces doom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I, who this cause take on me to defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say (whether fairer or less fair I be)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I came not as a woman, nor intend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That now mine actions shall be womanly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, saving I undress, who shall pretend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To say I am or am not such as she?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither should aught be said but what we know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And least of all what works another woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Many, as well as I, long tresses wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet are not therefore women; if, as guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have admittance gained to your repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like woman or like man, is manifest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then why should I the name of woman bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in my actions stand a man confest?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis ruled that woman should a woman chase;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor that a knight a woman should displace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Grant we (what I confess not howsoe’er)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you the woman in my visage read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that in beauty I am not her peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not therefore, deem I, of my valour’s meed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye would deprive me, though in beauteous cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The palm I to that damsel should concede.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere hard, before I yield to her in charms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I should forfeit what I won in arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if it be your usage, that the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who yields in beauty, from your tower must wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here to remain I my design to proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should my resolve have good or evil game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence I infer, unequal were the game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she and I in beauty should contend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if such strife ’twixt her and me ensues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nought can the damsel gain, and much may lose;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And save the gain and loss well balanced be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In every match, the contest is unfair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that by right, no less than courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May she a shelter claim in you repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But are there any here that disagree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to impugn my equal sentence dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold my prompt, at such gainsayer’s will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove my judgment right, his judgment ill!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant⁠—grieved that maid of gentle kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should from that castle wrongfully be sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bide the raging of the rain and wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where sheltering house was none, nor even shed⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With reasons good, in wary speech combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Persuades that lord; but mostly what she said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On ending silences the knight; and he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Allows the justice of that damsel’s plea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when hot summer sun the soil has rived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And most the thirsty plant of moisture drains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weak and wasting flower, well nigh deprived</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that quick sap which circled in its veins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sucks in the welcome rain, and is revived;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, when bold Bradamant so well maintains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courier maid’s defence, her beauteous cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mirth revive, and brighten as whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At length the supper, which had long been dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet was touched, enjoys each hungry guest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any further news of errant knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them, seated at the festive board, molest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All, saving Bradamant, enjoy, whose sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As wont, is still afflicted and opprest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that suspicious fear, that doubt unjust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which racked her bosom, marred the damsel’s gust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The supper done⁠—brought sooner to a close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply from their desire to feast their eyes⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First of the set, Duke Aymon’s daughter rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next the courier maid is seen to rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that the warder signs to one, that goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many torches fires in nimble wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose light on storied wall and ceiling fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What followed shall another canto tell.</span>

				<span class="i1">Were they unhorsed, but by a woman’s spear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now what of Roland’s and Rinaldo’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not without reason held in such renown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ought you to think (she said) when thus in fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye by a female hand are overthrown?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say, if the buckler one of these requite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Better than by a woman ye have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will ye by those redoubted warriors do?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So think not I, nor haply think so you.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This may suffice you all; and need in none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A clearer proof of prowess to display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who desires, if rashly any one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desires, again his valour to assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would add but scathe to shame, now made his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now; and the same to-day as yesterday.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless perchance he thinks it praise and gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By such illustrious warriors to be slain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they by Ulany were certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman’s hand had caused their overthrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with a deeper black than pitch had dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their honour, heretofore so fair of show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than ten her story testified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where one sufficed⁠—with such o’erwhelming woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were they possest, they with such fury burned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They well nigh on themselves their weapons turned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What arms they had upon them, they unbound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cast them, strung by rage and fury sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the moat which girt that castle round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even kept the faulchions which they wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, since a woman them had cast to ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erwhelmed with rage and shame, the warriors swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Themselves of such a crying shame to clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“They, without bearing arms, would pass a year;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And that they evermore afoot would fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Up hill or down, by mountain or by plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, when the year was ended, would they wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knightly mail or climb the steed again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that from other they by force should bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In battle, other steeds and other chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, without arms, to punish their misdeeds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These wend afoot, those others on their steeds.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lodged in a township at the fall of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Duke Aymon’s daughter, journeying Paris-ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hears how King Agramant was foiled in fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good harbourage withal of bed and board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in her hostel found; but small delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This and all comforts else to her afford.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the sad damsel meat and sleep foregoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor finds a resting place; far less repose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But so I will not on her story dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As not to seek anew the valiant twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, by consent, beside a lonely well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had tied their goodly coursers by the rein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of their war to you somedeal will tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A war not waged for empire or domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the best should buckle to his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good Durindana, and Bayardo ride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No signal they, no trumpet they attend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To blow them to the lists, no master who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should teach them when to foin and when to fend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or wake their sleeping wrath; their swords they drew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, one against the other, boldly wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lifted blades, the quick and dext’rous two.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already ’gan the champions’ fury heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fast and hard their swords were heard to beat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None e’er by proof two other faulchions chose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sound and solid, able to endure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three strokes alone of such conflicting foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passing all means and measure; but so pure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So perfect was their temper, from all blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By such repeated trial so secure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They in a thousand strokes might clash on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nay more, nor yet the solid metal fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With mickle industry, with mighty pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And art, Rinaldo, shifting here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avoids the deadly dint of Durindane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well knowing how ’tis wont to cleave and tear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso struck with greater might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But well nigh all his strokes were spent in air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of, if he sometimes smote, he smote on part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Durindana wrought less harm than smart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo with more skill his blade inclined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stunned the arm of Sericana’s lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him oft he reached where casque and coat confined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And often raked his haunches with the sword:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But adamantine was his corslet’s rind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor link the restless faulchion broke or bored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If so impassive was the paynim’s scale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know, charmed by magic was the stubborn mail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Without reposing they long time had been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon their deadly battle so intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, save on one another’s troubled mien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their angry eyes the warriors had not bent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When such despiteous war and deadly spleen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Diverted by another strife, were spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing a mighty noise, both champions turn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good Bayardo, sore bested, discern.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They good Bayardo by a monster view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—A bird, and bigger than that courser⁠—prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above three yards in length appeared to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monster’s beak; a bat in all the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equipt with feathers, black as ink in hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And piercing talons was the winged pest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An eye of fire it had, a cruel look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like ship-sails, two spreading pinions shook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Perhaps it was a bird; but when or where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another bird resembling this was seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not, I, nor have I any where,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except in Turpin, heard that such has been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence that it was a fiend, to upper air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evoked from depths of nether hell I ween;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Malagigi raised by magic sleight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That so he might disturb the champions’ fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So deemed Rinaldo too: and contest sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt him and Malagigi hence begun;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he would not confess the charge; nay swore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even by the light which lights the glorious sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might clear him of the blame he bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had not that which was imputed done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether a fiend or fowl, the pest descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And good Bayardo with his talons rends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quickly the steed, possessed of mickle might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breaks loose, and, in his fury and despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the monster strives with kick and bite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But swiftly he retires and soars in air:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thence returning, prompt to wheel and smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Circles and beats the courser, here and there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wholly unskilled in fence, and sore bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bayardo swiftly from the monster fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bayardo to the neighbouring forest flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeking the closest shade and thickest spray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above the feathered monster flaps, with eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent to mark where widest is the way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that good horse the greenwood threads, and lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last within a grot, concealed from day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the winged beast has lost Bayardo’s traces,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He soars aloft, and other quarry chases.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo and Gradasso, who descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bayardo’s flight, the conqueror’s destined meed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The battle to suspend, on either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they regained the goodly horse, agreed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saved from that fowl which chased him, far and wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conditioning whichever found the steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him anew should to that fountain wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside whose brim their battle they should end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Quitting the fount, they follow, where they view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">New prints upon the forest greensward made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By much Bayardo distances the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose tardy feet their wishes ill obeyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself the king on his Alfana threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That near at hand was tethered in the glade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving his foe behind in evil plight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Never more malcontent and vext in sprite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo ceased in little time to spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bayardo’s traces, who strange course had run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made for thorny thicket, wet or dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tree, rock, or river, with design to shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those cruel claws, which, pouncing from the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him such outrage and such scathe had done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, after labour vain and sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To await him at the fount returned once more;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In case, as erst concerted by the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king should thither with the steed resort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But having sought him there with little gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fared to his camp afoot, with piteous port.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return we now to him of Sericane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He that had sped withal in other sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, not by judgement, guided to his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his rare fortune, heard Bayardo neigh;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And found him shrowded in his caverned lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sore moreover by his fright opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He feared to issue into open air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus of that horse himself the king possest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well he remembered their conditions were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring him to the fount; but little pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now was that knight to keep the promise made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus within himself in secret said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Win him who will, in war and strife, I more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desire in peace to make the steed my own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the world’s further side, did I of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wend hitherward, and for this end alone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having the courser, he mistakes me sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thinks the prize by me will be foregone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him would Rinaldo conquer, let him fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Ind, as I to France have made repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For him no less secure is Sericane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than twice for me has been his France,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pricked for Arles, along the road most plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in its haven found the fleet arrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Freighted with him, the steed and Durindane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A well-rigged galley from that harbour weighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these hereafter!⁠—I, at other call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now quit Rinaldo, king, and France, and all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho in his flight will I pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That made his hippogryph like palfrey flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With reins and sell, so quick the welkin through;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hawk and eagle soar a course less free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er the wide land of Gaul the warrior flew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Pyrenees to Rhine, from sea to sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He westward to the mountains turned aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which France’s fertile land from Spain divide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Arragon he past out of Navarre,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—They who beheld, sore wondering at the sight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then leaves he Tarragon behind him far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his left, Biscay upon his right:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Traversed Castile, Gallicia, Lisbon, are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seville and Cordova, with rapid flight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor city on sea-shore, nor inland plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is unexplored throughout the realm of Spain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beneath him Cadiz and the strait he spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where whilom good Alcides closed the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the Atlantic to the further side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Egypt, bent o’er Africa, to stray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The famous Balearic isles descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Ivica, that in his passage lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Toward Arzilla then he turned the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above the sea that severs it from Spain.</span>

				<span>Morocco, Fez, and Oran, looking down,</span>

				<span class="i1">Which from all cities bear away the crown,</span>

				<span class="i1">No palm or parsley wreath, but crown of gold;</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Capys, Alzerba’s isle, the warrior bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tripoli, Berniche, Ptolomitta viewed,</span>

			<p>
				<span>’Twixt Atlas’ shaggy ridges and the shore,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passing the sandy desert of the Moor,</span>

				<span>Of all those Aethiop monarchs, beyond measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first was this, for riches and for might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he with all his puissance, all his treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! had miserably lost his sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet was this the monarch’s least displeasure:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vexed by a direr and a worse despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harassed, though richest of those Nubian kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By a perpetual hunger’s cruel stings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whene’er to eat or drink the wretched man</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepared, by that resistless need pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith⁠—infernal and avenging clan⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared the monstrous Harpies’ craving brood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, armed with beak and talons, overran</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vessel and board, and preyed upon the food;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what their wombs suffice not to receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foul and defiled the loathsome monsters leave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this: because upborn by such a tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of full-blown honours, in his unripe age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he excelled in heart and nerve, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The riches of his royal heritage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like Lucifer, the monarch waxed in pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And war upon his maker thought to wage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with his host against the mountain went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Egypt’s mighty river finds a vent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon this hill which well-nigh kissed the skies,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-423" id="noteref-423" epub:type="noteref">423</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Piercing the clouds, the king had heard recite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was seated the terrestrial paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where our first parents flourished in delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With camels, elephants, and footmen hies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither that king, confiding in his might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With huge desire if peopled be the land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bring its nations under his command.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>God marred the rash emprise, and from on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent down an angel, whose destroying sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred thousand of that chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slew, and to endless night condemned their lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Emerging, next, from hellish caverns, fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These horrid harpies and assault his board;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which still pollute or waste the royal meat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor leave the monarch aught to drink or eat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And him had plunged in uttermost despair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that to him erewhile had prophesied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The loathsome Harpies should his daily fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leave unpolluted only, when astride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of winged horse, arriving through the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An armed cavalier should be descried.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for impossible appears the thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Devoid of hope remains the mournful king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now that with wonderment his followers spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The English cavalier so make his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er every wall, o’er every turret high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some swiftly to the king the news convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who calls to mind that ancient prophecy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heedless of the staff, his wonted stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through joy, with outstretched arms and tottering feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Comes forth, the flying cavalier to meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within the castle court Astolpho flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, with spacious wheels, on earth descended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king, conducted by his courtly crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the warrior knelt, with arms extended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cried; “Thou angel send of God, thou new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Messiah, if too sore I have offended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For mercy, yet, bethink thee, ’tis our bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To sin, and thine to pardon who repent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Knowing my sin, I ask not, I, to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Such grace I dare not ask⁠—restored to light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For well I ween such power resides in thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Being accepted in thy Maker’s sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let it suffice, that I no longer see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let me with perpetual hunger fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least, expel the harpies’ loathsome horde,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let them more pollute my ravaged board;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I to build thee, in my royal hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A holy temple, made of marble, swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all its portals and its roof of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And decked, within and out, with jewels rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here shall thy mighty miracle be told</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sculpture, and thy name the dome shall bear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So spake the sightless king of Nubia’s reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sought to kiss the stranger’s feet in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor angel”⁠—good Astolpho made reply⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor new Messiah, I from heaven descend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less a mortal and a sinner I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To such high grace unworthy to pretend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay the monsters I all means will try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or drive them from the realm which they offend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I shall prosper, be thy praises paid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To God alone, who sent me to thine aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Offer these vows to God, to him well due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him thy churches build, thine altars rear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discoursing so, together wend the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid barons bold, that king and cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Nubian prince commands the menial crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith to bring the hospitable cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hopes that now the foul, rapacious band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will not dare snatch the victual from his hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Forthwith a solemn banquet they prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within the gorgeous palace of the king.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seated alone here guest and sovereign are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the attendant troop the viands bring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold! a whizzing sound is heard in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which echoes with the beat of savage wing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold! the band of harpies thither flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lured by the scent of victual from the skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All bear a female face of pallid dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seven in number are the horrid band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Emaciated with hunger, lean, and dry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fouler than death; the pinions they expand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ragged, and huge, and shapeless to the eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The talon crook’d; rapacious is the hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fetid and large the paunch; in many a fold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like snake’s, their long and knotted tails are rolled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fowls are heard in air; then swoops amain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The covey well nigh in that instant, rends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The food, o’erturns the vessels, and a rain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of noisome ordure on the board descends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To stop their nostrils king and duke are fain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such an insufferable stench offends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the greedy birds, as wrath excites,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho with his brandished faulchion smites.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At croup or collar now he aims his blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now strikes at neck or pinion; but on all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if he smote upon a bag of tow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The strokes without effect and languid fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while nor dish nor goblet they forego;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor void those ravening fowls the regal hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they have feasted full, and left the food</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waste or polluted by their rapine rude.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That king had firmly hoped the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would from his royal seat the harpies scare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He now, that hope foregone, with nought to cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laments, and sighs, and groans in his despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his good horn remembers him the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose clangours helpful aye in peril are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deems his bugle were the fittest mean</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To free the monarch from those birds unclean;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And first to fill their ears, to king and train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With melted wax, Astolpho gives command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That every one who hears the deafening strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May not in panic terror fly the land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He takes the reins, his courser backs again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grasps the enchanted bugle in his hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the sewer next signs to have the board</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew with hospitable victual stored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The meats he to an open galley bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other banquet spreads on other ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold, as wont, the harpy-squad appears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho quickly lifts the bugle’s round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (for unguarded are their harassed ears)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The harpies are not proof against the sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In terror form the royal dome they speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor meat nor aught beside the monsters heed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After them spurs in haste the valiant peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the winged courser forth is flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving beneath him, in his swift career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The royal castle and the crowded town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bugle ever pealing, far and near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The harpies fly toward the torrid zone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor light until they reach that loftiest mountain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where springs, if anywhere, Nile’s secret fountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Almost at that aerial mountain’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deep under earth, extends a gloomy cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The surest pass for him, as they repeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That would at any time descend to hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hither the predatory troop retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As a safe refuge from the deafening yell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As far, and farther than Cocytus’ shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descending, till that horn is heard no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At that dark hellish inlet, which a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opens to him who would abandon light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The terrifying bugle ceased to bray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The courser furled his wings and stopt his flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, ere Astolpho further I convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Not to depart from my accustomed rite⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since on all sides the paper overflows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall conclude my canto and repose.</span>

				<span>O fierce and hungry harpies, that on blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And erring Italy so full have fed!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-424" id="noteref-424" epub:type="noteref">424</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom, for the scourge of ancient sins designed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply just Heaven to every board has sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Innocent children, pious mothers, pined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hunger, die, and see their daily bread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The orphan’s and the widow’s scanty food⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feed for a single feast that filthy brood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Too foul a fault was his, who did unclose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cave long shut, and made the passage free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence <em>that</em> greediness, <em>that</em> filth arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our Italy’s infection doomed to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then was good life extinguished, and repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So banished, that with strife and poverty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fear and trouble, is she still perplext,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shall for many a future year be vext:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Till she her sons has shaken by the hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from Lethaean sloth to life restored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaiming, “Will none imitate that pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zethes and Calais,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-425" id="noteref-425" epub:type="noteref">425</a> with avenging sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rescue from claws and stench our goodly fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleanse and glad anew the genial board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they king Phineus from those fowls released,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And England’s peer restored the Nubian’s feast?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hunting those hideous birds, that cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye scared them with the bugle’s horrid sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till at the mountain-cave his long career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He closed, and ran the monstrous troop to ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Attentive to the vent he held his ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in that troubled cavern heard rebound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weeping and wailing, and eternal yell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proof certain that its entrance led to hell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho doubts if he within shall wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And see those wretched ones expelled from day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the central pit of earth descend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the infernal gulfs around survey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Why should I fear, that on my horn depend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For certain succour?” (did the warrior say)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Satan and Pluto so will I confound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drive before me their three-headed hound.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He speedily his winged horse forsook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Him to a sapling near at hand he ties)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavern entered next; but first he took</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His horn, whereon the knight in all relies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not far has he advanced before a smoke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obscure and foul, offends his nose and eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ranker than pitch and sulphur is the stench,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not thereat does good Astolpho blench.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But as he more descends into that lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much he finds the smoke and vapour worse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it appears he can no further fare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, backward must retrace his way parforce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! something (<em>what</em> he knows not) he in air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Espies, that seems in motion, like a corse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon whose wasted form long time had beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winter’s rain and summers scorching heat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that dim cavern was so little light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Yea, well-nigh might be said that light was none⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nought sees or comprehends the English knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What wavers so, above that vapour dun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For surer proof, a stroke or two would smite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his good faulchion Otho’s valiant son:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-426" id="noteref-426" epub:type="noteref">426</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then deemed that duke it was a spirit, whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seemed to strike amid the misty gloom.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When him a melancholy voice addressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Ah! without harming other, downward wend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me but too sore the sable fumes molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which hither form the hellish fires ascend.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thereat the duke, amazed, his steps represt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the spirit cried; “So may Heaven send</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A respite from the vapours that exhale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As thou shalt deign to tell thy mournful tale!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And to be known on earth shouldst thou be fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee will I satisfy.” To him the sprite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sweet it seems to me, in fame again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus to return into the glorious light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My huge desire such favour to obtain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forces my words from me in my despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constraining me to tell the things ye seek;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though ’tis annoyance and fatigue to speak.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Lydia, the child of Lydia’s king, am I,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-427" id="noteref-427" epub:type="noteref">427</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To proud estate and princely honours born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned by righteous doom of God on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In murky smoke eternally to mourn:</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">Me he encounters pale and trembling sore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem a vanquished man’s a prisoner’s brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, rather than a victor’s semblance, bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I who perceive he loves, address not now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior as I was resolved before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My vantage I descry, and shift my ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fit the state wherein that knight was found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To curse the warrior’s passion I begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of his crying cruelty complained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since foully by my father had he done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And me would have by violence constrained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with more grace my person would have won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor waited many days, had he maintained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His course of courtship, as begun whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To king and all of us so passing dear;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if the honest suit he hoped to gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been at first rejected by my sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas, he was somedeal of a churlish vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever yielded to a first desire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should not therefore, restive to the rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have left his goodly task, so prompt to ire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sure, passing aye from good to better deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In little time to win the wished-for meed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if my father would not have been won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him I would so earnestly have prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he my lover should have made his son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, had my royal sire my suit gainsayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him in secret that I would have done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith he should have deemed himself appaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But since, it seemed, he other means designed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never to love him had I fixed my mind;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, though I sought him, at my father’s hest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pious love for him had been my guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He might be sure, not long should be possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bliss that I, in my despite, supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the red blood should issue from my breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as his ill will was satisfied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this my wretched person, which alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He so by brutal force should make his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With these, and words like these, I moved the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I such puissance in myself espied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him so contrite made, in desert drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never seen a saint more mortified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before my feet the doleful cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell down, and snatched a poniard from his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, he protested, I parforce should take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for so foul a sin my vengeance slake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To push my mighty victory to an end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I scheme, when him I see in such distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And give him hopes he may even yet pretend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I deservedly his love should bless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he his ancient error will amend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will of his realm my father repossess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will in future time deserve my charms</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By love and service, not by force of arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So promised he to do; and set me free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let me, as I came, untouched, depart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even to kiss my lips he ventured; see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he is yoked securely, if his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love has well touched with the desire of me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he for him need feather other dart!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seeks the Armenian, why by pact should take</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever spoil the conquering armies make;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And him, as best he might, would fain persuade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘To leave to Lydia’s monarch his domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon whose wasted lands his host had preyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rest content with his Armenian reign.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘He would not hear of this,’ (the monarch said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With cheers with fury swolen) ‘nor would refrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From pressing Lydia’s king with armed band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long as he possessed a palm of land;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And if the knight, when a vile woman sues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His purpose shift, let him the evil bear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>He</em> will not, for the warrior’s asking, lose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What he has hardly conquered in a year.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alcestes to the king his suit renews,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next complains, that he rejects his prayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length the Thracian fires, and threatens high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By love or force the monarch shall comply.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So kindling anger waxed between the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It urged them from ill words to worser deed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the king his sword Alcestes drew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though thousands aid the monarch in his need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in despite of all, their sovereign slew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made that day as well the Armenian bleed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Backed by the Thracians’ and Cilicians’ aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other followers, by the warrior paid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His conquest he pursued, and, at his cost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without expense to us, in less than one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short month, the kingdom by my father lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Restored; and, to repair the mischief done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Beside spoil given) he conquered with his host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Taxing or taking what his arms had won⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armenia and Cappadocia which confine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scowered Hyrcania to the distant brine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Him not to greet with triumphs, but to slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning from that warfare, we intend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, fearing failure, our design delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that we find too many him befriend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feeding him aye with hope from day to day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I for the Thracian warrior love pretend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first declare my will that he oppose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prove his valour on our other foes;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And him, now sole, now ill accompanied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On strange and perilous emprize I speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein a thousand knights might well have died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all things happily with him succeed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Victory was ever on his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft with horrid foes of monstrous breed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Giants and with Lestrigons, who brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Damage in our domains, the warrior fought.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Ebro’s sunny bank, or other place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As (hiding murderous hate, while I implore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I exercise my lover still in strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the same fell design upon his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Unable to achieve my first intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I on a scheme of no less mischief fall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through me, all deemed his friends by him are shent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thus bring down on him the hate of all.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Thracian leader never more content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to obey, whatever be the call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is at my bidding ever prompt to smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without regarding who or what the wight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When I perceive that, through the warrior’s mean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguished is my father’s every foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, conquered by himself, that knight is seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Friendless, through us⁠—I now the masque forego:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What I, from him, beneath a flattering mien,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had hitherto concealed, I plainly show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—What deep and deadly hate by bosom fired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that I but to work his death desired.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then, thinking if such course I should pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That public shame would still the deed attend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For men too well my obligations knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would be prompt my cruelty to shend.)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseemed enough to drive him from my view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he should no more my eyes offend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would I more address or see the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor letter would receive or message hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This my ingratitude in him such pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length produced, that mastered by his woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After entreating mercy long in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sickened sore and sank beneath the blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For pain which fits my sin, dark fumes now stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My cheek, and with salt rheum mine eyes o’erflow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus in eternal torment shall I dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For saving mercy helpeth not in hell.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since wretched Lydia spake no more, the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fain discern if more in torment lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, those false ingrates’ curse, the darkness drear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So waxed before him, and obscured the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That not one inch advanced the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, back parforce returns that warrior; nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself from that increasing smoke to save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes for the mouth of the disastrous cave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The motion of his quickly shifting feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More savours of a run than walk or trot.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus mounting the ascent in swift retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho sees the outlet of the grot;</span>

			<p>
				<span>And next to bar the way against that band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose greedy bellies so for victual crave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Picks stones, and trees lays level with his brand,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what might seem a hedge, with busy hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As best he can, constructs before the cave;</span>

				<span>While in that cave Astolpho did remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fumes that from the sable pitch arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only what appeared to sight did stain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But even so searched the flesh beneath his clothes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sought some cleansing stream, long sought in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But found at length a limpid till, which rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of a living rock, within that wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bathed himself all over in the flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then backed the griffin-horse, and soared a flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereby to reach that mountain’s top he schemes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which little distant, with its haughty height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the moon’s circle good Astolpho deems;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, such desire to see it warms the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he aspires to heaven, nor earth esteems.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through air so more and more the warrior strains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he at last the mountain-summit gains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here sapphire, ruby, gold, and topaz glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pearl, jacinth, chrysolite and diamond lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which well might pass for natural flowers which blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Catching their colour from that kindly sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So green the grass! could we have such below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We should prefer it to our emerald’s dye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As fair the foliage of those pleasant bowers!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose trees are ever filled with fruit and flowers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Warble the wanton birds in verdant brake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Azure, and red, and yellow, green and white.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The quavering rivulet and quiet lake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In limpid hue surpass the crystal bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A breeze, which with one breath appears to shake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye, without fill or fall, the foliage light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the quick air such lively motion lends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Day’s oppressive noon in nought offends;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this, mid fruit and flower and verdure there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evermore stealing divers odours, went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made of those mixt sweets a medley rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which filled the spirit with a calm content.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the mid plain arose a palace fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seemed as if with living flames it brent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such passing splendour and such glorious light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shot from those walls, beyond all usage bright.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither where those transparent walls appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which cover more than thirty miles in measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At ease and slowly moved the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And viewed the lovely region at his leisure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed⁠—compared with this⁠—that sad and drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seen by heaven and nature with displeasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the foul world, wherein we dwell below:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So jocund this, so sweet and fair in show!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astound with wonder, paused the adventurous knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to that shining palace he was nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, than the carbuncle more crimson bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed one polished stone of sanguine dye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O mighty wonder! O Daedalian sleight!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What fabric upon earth with this can vie?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let them henceforth be silent, that in story</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exalt the world’s seven wonders to such glory!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An elder, in the shining entrance-hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that glad house, towards Astolpho prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crimson his waistcoat was, and white his pall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vermillion seemed the mantle, milk the vest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">White was that ancient’s hair, and white withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bushy beard descending to his breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his reverend face such glory beamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the elect of Paradise he seemed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, with glad visage, to the paladin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who humbly, from his sell had lighted, cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O gentle baron, that by will divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have soared to this terrestrial paradise!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit nor you the cause of your design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor you the scope of your desire surmise,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hitherward, from your arctic hemisphere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You for instruction, how to furnish aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Charles and to the Church in utmost need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With me to counsel, hither are conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who without counsel from such distance speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, son, ascribe not you the journey made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wit or worth; nor through your winged steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor through your virtuous bugle had ye thriven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that such helping grace from God was given.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We will discourse at better leisure more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you what must be done shall after hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But you, that, through long fast, must hunger sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First brace your strength with us, with genial cheer.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Continuing his discourse, that elder hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised mighty wonder in the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he avouched, as he his name disclosed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he <b>The Holy Gospel</b> had composed;</span>

			<p>
				<span>He of our Lord so loved, the blessed John;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-431" id="noteref-431" epub:type="noteref">431</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom a speech among the brethren went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He never should see death,” and hence the Son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of God with this rebuke <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter shent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In saying, “What is it to thee, if one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tarry on earth, till I anew be sent?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit he said not that he should not die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That so he meant to say we plain descry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Translated thither, he found company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The patriarch Enoch, and the mighty seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Elias; nor as yet those sainted three</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have seen corruption, but in garden, clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of earth’s foul air, will joy eternity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of spring, till they angelic trumpets hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounding through heaven and earth, proclaim aloud</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Christ’s second advent on the silvery cloud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The holy ancients to a chamber lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With welcome kind, the adventurous cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in another then his flying steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sufficiently with goodly forage cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho they with fruits of Eden feed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So rich, that in his judgment ’twould appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In some sort might our parents be excused</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If, for such fruits, obedience they refused.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When with that daily payment which man owes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nature had been contented by the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well of due refreshment as repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For all and every comfort found he here)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now Aurora left her ancient spouse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not for his many years to her less dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rising from bed, Astolpho at his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The apostle, so beloved of God, espied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much that not lawfully could here be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taking him by the hand, to him he read.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To you, though come from France, may be unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What there hath happened,” next the apostle said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Learn, your Orlando, for he hath foregone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The way wherein he was enjoined to tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is visited of God, that ever shends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him whom he loveth best, when he offends:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He, your Orlando, at his birth endowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sovereign daring and with sovereign might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom, beyond all usage, God bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The grace, that weapon him should vainly smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he was selected from the crowd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be defender of his Church’s right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he elected Sampson, called whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Jew against the Philistine to cheer;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He, your Orlando, for such gifts has made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto his heavenly Lord an ill return:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who left his people, when most needing aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then most abandoned to the heathens’ scorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Incestuous love for a fair paynim maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had blinded so that knight, of grace forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That twice and more in fell and impious strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The count has sought his faithful cousin’s life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hence God hath made him mad, and, in this vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Belly, and breast, and naked flesh expose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so diseased and troubled is his brain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That none, and least himself, the champion knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nebuchadnezzar whilom to such pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God in his vengeance doomed, as story shows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent, for seven years, of savage fury full,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To feed on grass and hay, like slavering bull.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But yet, because the Christian paladine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has sinned against his heavenly Maker less,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He only for three months, by will divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is doomed to cleanse himself of his excess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet with other scope did your design</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wending hither the Redeemer bless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that through us the mode you should explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando’s missing senses to restore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Tis true to journey further ye will need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wholly must you leave this nether sphere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the moon’s circle you I have to lead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the planets to our world most near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the medicine, that is fit to speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Insane Orlando’s cure, is treasured here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This night will we away, when over head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her downward rays the silver moon shall shed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In talk the blest apostle is diffuse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this and that, until the day is worn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the sun is sunk i’ the salt sea ooze,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And overhead the moon uplifts her horn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A chariot is prepared, erewhile in use</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scower the heavens, wherein of old was borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Jewry’s misty mountains to the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sainted Elias, rapt from mortal eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Four goodly coursers next, and redder far</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than flame, to that fair chariot yokes the sire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when the knight and he well seated are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Collects the reins; and heavenward they aspire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In airy circles swiftly rose the car,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reached the region of eternal fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose heat the saint by miracle suspends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While through the parted air the pair ascends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The chariot, towering, threads the fiery sphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rises thence into the lunar reign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, in its larger part they find as clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As polished steel, when undefiled by stain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such it seems, or little less, when near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As what the limits of our earth contain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as our earth, the last of globes below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Including seas, which round about it flow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here doubly waxed the paladin’s surprize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see that place so large, when viewed at hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resembling that a little hoop in size,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from the globe surveyed whereon we stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he both his eyes behoved to strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he would view Earth’s circling seas and land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, by reason of the lack of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their images attained to little height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here other river, lake, and rich champaign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are seen, than those which are below descried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here other valley, other hill and plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With towns and cities of their own supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which mansions of such mighty size contain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such never he before of after spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here spacious hold and lonely forest lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where nymphs for ever chased the panting prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, that with other scope had thither soared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pauses not all these wonder to peruse:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But led by the disciple of our Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His way towards a spacious vale pursues;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A place wherein is wonderfully stored</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever on our earth below we lose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Collected there are all things whatsoe’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost through time, chance, or our own folly, here.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor here alone of realm and wealthy dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er which aye turns the restless wheel, I say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of what it is not in the power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Fortune to bestow, or take away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much fame is here, whereon Time and the Hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like wasting moth, in this our planet prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here countless vows, here prayers unnumbered lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made by us sinful men to God on high.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lover’s tears and sighs; what time in pleasure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And play we here unprofitably spend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this, of ignorant men the eternal leisure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vain designs, aye frustrate of their end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Empty desires so far exceed all measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They o’er that valley’s better part extend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There wilt thou find, if thou wilt thither post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever thou on earth beneath hast lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, passing by those heaps, on either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this and now of that the meaning sought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Formed of swollen bladders here a hill did stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence he heard cries and tumults, as he thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These were old crowns of the Assyrian land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Lydian⁠—as that paladin was taught⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grecian and Persian, all of ancient fame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now, alas! well-nigh without a name.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Golden and silver hooks to sight succeed,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To greedy prince and patron; many a snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed in garlands, did the warrior heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who heard, these signs of adulation were;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in cicalas, which their lungs had burst,</span>

				<span>Loves of unhappy end in imagery</span>

				<span class="i1">Then eagles’ talons, the authority</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which great lords their delegates invest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bellows filled every nook, the fume and fee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein the favourites of kings are blest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Given to those Ganymedes that have their hour,</span>

			<p>
				<span>O’erturned, here ruined town and castle lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all their wealth: “The symbols” (said his guide)</span>

				<span class="i1">“Of treaties and of those conspiracies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which their conductors seemed so ill to hide.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpents with female faces, felonies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of coiners and of robbers, he descried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next broken bottles saw of many sorts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The types of servitude in sorry courts.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He marks mighty pool of porridge spilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And asks what in that symbol should be read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hers ’twas charity, by sick men willed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For distribution, after they were dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He passed a heap of flowers, that erst distilled</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—As it appears⁠—none pray to Heaven for more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of sense, whereof a lofty mount</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone surpast all else which I recount.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was as ’twere a liquor soft and thin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, save well corked, would from the vase have drained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laid up, and treasured various flasks within,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Larger or lesser, to that use ordained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That largest was which of the paladin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anglantes’ lord, the mighty sense contained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from those others was discerned, since writ</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the vessel was <b>Orlando’s Wit</b>.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The names of those whose wits therein were pent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thus on all those other flasks espied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much of his own, but with more wonderment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sense of many others he descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, he believed, no dram of theirs had spent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here, by tokens clear was satisfied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That scantily therewith were they purveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So large the quantity he here surveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some waste on love, some seeking honour, lose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their wits, some, scouring seas, for merchandise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some, that on wealthy lords their hope repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And some, befooled by silly sorceries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These upon pictures, upon jewels those;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These on whatever else they highest prize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astrologers’ and sophists’ wits mid these,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many a poet’s too, Astolpho sees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since his consent the apostle signified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who wrote the obscure Apocalypse, his own</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took, and only to his nose applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When (it appeared) it to its place was gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And henceforth, has Sir Turpin certified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That long time sagely lived king Otho’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till other error (as he says) again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deprived the gentle baron of his brain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fullest vessel and of amplest round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which held the wit Orlando erst possessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho took; nor this so light he found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it appeared, when piled among the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before, from those bright spheres, now earthward bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His course is to our lower orb addressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him to a spacious palace, by whose side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A river ran, conducts his holy guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Filled full of fleeces all its chambers were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wool, silk, linen, cotton, in their hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of diverse dyes and colours, foul and fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yarns to her reel from all those fleeces drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the outer porch, a dame of hoary hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On summer-day thus village wife we view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the new silk is reeled, its filmy twine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wind from the worm, and soak the slender line.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A second dame replaced the work when done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other; and one bore it off elsewhere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A third selected from the fleeces spun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mingled by that second, foul from fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What is this labour?” said the peer to John;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the disciple answered Otho’s heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Know that the Parcae are those ancient wives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in this fashion spin your feeble lives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As long as one fleece lasts, life in such wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endureth, nor outlasts it by a thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Death and Nature have their watchful eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the hour when each should to his end be brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The choicest threads are culled for Paradise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, after, for its ornaments are wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fashioned from the strands of foulest show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are galling fetters for the damned below.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On all the fleeces that erewhile were laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the reel, and culled for other care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The names were graved on little plates, which made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of silver, or of gold, or iron, were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These piled in many heaps he next surveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence an old man some skins was seen to bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, seemingly unwearied, hurried sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His restless way retracing evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That elder is so nimble and so prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he seems born to run: he bears away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of those heaps by lapfulls in his vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tickets that the different names display.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherefore and whither he his steps addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you I shall in other canto say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you, in sign of pleasure, will attend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that kind audience ye are wont to lend.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conquers the giant monarch of Argier,</span>

				<span>Madonna, who will scale the high ascent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of heaven, to me my judgment to restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, since from your bright eyes the weapon went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That pierced my heart, is wasting evermore?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet will not I such mighty loss lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that it drain no faster than before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But⁠—ebbing further⁠—I should fear to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as Orlando is described by me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To have anew that judgment, through the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem there is no need for me to fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the moon’s circle, or to Paradise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, I believe, mine is not lodged so high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On your bright visage, on your beauteous eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alabastrine neck, and paps of ivory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wander my wits, and I with busy lip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I may have them back, these fain would sip.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho wandered through that palace wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Observing al the future lives around:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When those already woven he had spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the fatal wheel for finish wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He a fair fleece discerned that far outvied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fine gold, whose wondrous lustre jewels ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could these into a thread be drawn by art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would never equal by the thousandth part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beauteous fleece he saw with wondrous glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equalled by none amid that countless store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when and whose such glorious life should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Longed sore to know. “This,” (said the apostle hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealing nothing of its history,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Shall have existence twenty years before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dating from <b>The Incarnate Word</b>, the year</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall marked my men with M and D appear;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-433" id="noteref-433" epub:type="noteref">433</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, as for splendour and for substance fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This fleece shall have no like or equal, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall the blest age wherein it shall appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be singular in this our world below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because all graces, excellent and rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Nature or which Study can bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or bounteous Fortune upon men can shower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be its certain and eternal dower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Between the king of rivers’ horns,” (he cries,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Stands what is now a small and humble town.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-434" id="noteref-434" epub:type="noteref">434</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before it runs the Po, behind it lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A misty pool of marsh; this⁠—looking down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stream of future years⁠—I recognize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First of Italian cities of renown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only famed for wall and palace rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But noble ways of life and studies fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Such exaltation, reached so suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is not fortuitous nor wrought in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that is may <em>his</em> worthy cradle be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof I speak, shall so the heaven ordain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For where men look for fruit they graff the tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And study still the rising plant to train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And artist uses to refine the gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Designed by him the precious gem to hold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor ever, in terrestrial realm, so fine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fair a raiment spirit did invest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rarely soul so great from realms divine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has been, or will be, thitherward addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that whereof <b>The Eternal</b> had design</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fashion good Hippolytus of Este:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippolytus of Este shall he be hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom so rich a gift of God shall light.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“All those fair graces, that, on many spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have served many wholly to array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are all united for his ornament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of whom thou hast entreated me to say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prop the arts, the virtues is he sent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And should I seek his merits to display,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long a time would last my tedious strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando might expect his wits in vain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas so Christ’s servant with the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discoursed; they having satisfied their view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sight of that fair mansion, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> whence conveyed were human lives, the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issued upon the stream, whose waves appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turbid with sand and of discoloured hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And found that ancient man upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who names, engraved on metal, thither bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I know not if you recollect; of him</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak, whose story I erewhile suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ancient of visage, and so swift of limb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That faster far than forest stag he wended.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With names he filled his mantle to the brim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye thinned the pile, but ne’er his labour ended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in that stream, hight Lethe, next bestowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, rather cast away, his costly load.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say, that when upon the river side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrives that ancient, of his store profuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He all those names into the turbid tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discharges, as he shakes his mantle loose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A countless shoal, they in the stream subside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor henceforth are they fit for any use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, out of mighty myriads, hardly one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is saved of those which waves and sand o’errun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Along that river and around it fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vile crows and ravening vultures, and a crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of choughs, and more, that with discordant cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deafening din their airy flight pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the prey all hurry, when from high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those ample riches they so scattered view:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with their beak or talon seize the prey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet little distance they their prize convey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they would raise themselves in upward flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They have not strength the burden to sustain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that parforce in Lethe’s water light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The worthy names, which lasting praise should gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two swans there are amid those birds, as white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My lord, as is your banner’s snowy grain:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-435" id="noteref-435" epub:type="noteref">435</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who catch what names they can, and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With these return securely to the shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus, counter to that ancient’s will malign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who them to the devouring river dooms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some names are rescued by the birds benign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wasteful Oblivion all the rest consumes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now swim about the stream those swans divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now beat the buxom air with nimble plumes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till, near that impious river’s bank, they gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hill, and on that hill a hallowed fane.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Immortality ’tis sacred; there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lovely nymph, that from the hill descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the Lethean river makes repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes from those swans their burden, and suspends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The names about an image, raised in air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a shaft, which in mid fane ascends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There consecrates and fixes them so fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all throughout eternity shall last.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of that old sire, and why he would dispense</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Idly, all those fair names, as ’twould appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of the birds and holy place, from whence</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The nymph was to the river seen to steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The solemn mystery, and the secret sense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho, marvelling, desired to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prayed the man of God would these unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to the warrior thus their meaning told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There moves no leaf beneath, thou hast to know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here above some sign thereof we trace;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-436" id="noteref-436" epub:type="noteref">436</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since all, in Heaven above or Earth below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must correspond, though with a different face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ancient, with his sweeping beard of snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By nought impeded and so swift of pace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Works the same end and purpose in our clime,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As are on earth below performed by Time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The life of man its final close attains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When on the wheel is wound the fatal twine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There fame, and here above the mark remains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For both would be immortal and divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for that bearded sire’s unwearied pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his below, that for their wreck combine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One drowns them, as thou seest, mid sand and surges.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one in long forgetfulness immerges.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And even, as here above, the raven, daw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vulture, and divers other birds of air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All from the turbid water seek to draw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The names, which in their sight appear most fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even thus below, pimps, flatterers, men of straw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Buffoons, informers, minions, all who there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flourish in courts, and in far better guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better odour, than the good and wise;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And by the crowd are gentle courtiers hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because they imitate the ass and swine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the just Parcae or (to speak aright)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Venus and Bacchus cut their master’s twine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—These base and sluggish dullards, whom I cite⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Born but to blow themselves with bread and wine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In their vile mouths awhile such names convey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then drop the load, which is Oblivion’s prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But as the joyful swans, that, singing sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Convey the medals safely to the fane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So they whose praises poets well repeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are rescued from oblivion, direr pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than death. O Princes, wary and discreet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That wisely tread in Caesar’s steps, and gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Authors for friends! They, doubt it not, shall save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your noble names from Lethe’s laxy wave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rare as those gentle swans are poets too,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will your horse and armour have (she cried),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And taking down all others from the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hang on the tomb alone those arms of pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will that you release each warlike thrall.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“The pact is just (King Rodomont replied),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But those, my prisoners, are not here confined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And therefore cannot be to you consigned.</span>

				<span>King Rodomont prepares his course to run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Comes on at speed; and with such mighty sound</span>

				<span class="i1">Echoes that bridge, the thundering noise might stun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ears of many distant from the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The golden lance its wonted work has done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that fierce Moor, in tourney so renowned,</span>

				<span>Scarce for her horse the martial damsel can</span>

				<span class="i1">Find space to pass, when she has thrown her foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And little lacked, and mighty risk she ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of falling into that deep stream below:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, born of wind and flame, good Rabican</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So dextrous was, and could so lightly go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He picked a path along the outer ledge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And could have paced upon a faulchion’s edge.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The damsel wheeled, towards the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returned, and him bespoke in sportive way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who is the loser now to thee is clear,</span>

				<span class="i1">Amazed, that woman him on earth should lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cannot, or he will not speak; and lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth, like one astound, in idiot guise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Silent and sad, he raised himself from ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when he some few paces thence had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His shield unbraced and helm and mail unbound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He flung against the tomb; and thence, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afoot the moody monarch left that ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not till he had given command to one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Of his four squires was he) to do his hest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relating to those captives, as exprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He parts; and save that in a caverned cell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He dwelt, no further news of him were known:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile the harness of that infidel</span>

				<span class="i1">Bradamant hung upon the lofty stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having thence removed all plate and shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith (as by the writing it was shown)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavaliers of Charles their limbs had drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She moved not, nor let other move, the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Besides the arms of Monodantes’ heir</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were those of Sansonet and Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, bound in search of good Orlando, were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither conducted by the road most near.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The day before here taken was the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sent by that proud paynim to Argier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These warriors’ arms the martial maid bade lower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that fair tomb, and stored them in the tower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All others, taken from the paynim train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant left suspended from the stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid these a king’s, that idly and in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had thither, seeking Frontalatte, gone:</span>

				<span class="i1">I say his arms, that ruled Circassia’s reign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, after wandering long, by date and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here to his grief another courser left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lightly went his way, of arms bereft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stript of his armour and afoot, did part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That paynim monarch from the bridge of dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Rodomont permitted to depart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those other knights that in his faith were bred:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to his camp to wend he had no heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For there he was ashamed to show his head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, in such fashion, thither to return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After his boasts, had been too foul a scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet still with new desire the warrior burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek her, fixed alone in his heart’s core;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such the monarch’s chance, he quickly learned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I cannot tell you who the tidings bore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She was towards her native land returned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, as Love spurs and goads him evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bowns him straight her footsteps to pursue:</span>

				<span class="i1">To mournful Flordelice the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She that still held her weeping visage low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned her, and courteously that lady prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell her whither she designed to go.</span>
				<br/>

				<span>“Which bark (I hope) and fitting company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To carry me to Afric may afford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will I halt upon my way, till I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once more rejoin my husband and my lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All means and measures there resolved to try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That may release him from his jailer’s ward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And should the Saracen deceitful prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others, and others yet, I mean to move.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My company (replied the martial fair)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For some part of the road, I offer thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till we have sight of Arles; then to repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, will pray you, for the love of me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find King Agramant’s Rogero there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose glorious name is spread o’er land and sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And render to that knight this goodly horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence the proud Moor was flung in martial course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Say thus, from point to point, ‘A cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That would in combat prove his chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the world at large would fain make clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy breach of faith with him, that thou may’st be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ready and well prepared for the career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave me this horse, that I might give it thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bids thee promptly mail and corslet dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wait him, who with thee will wage the fight.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Say this and nought beside, and would he hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My name, declare that ’tis to thee unknown.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wonted kindness cried that dame, “I ne’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In spending life itself, not words alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should weary in your service; since whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You would in my behalf as much have done.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her Aymon’s daughter thanked in courteous strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to her hand consigned Frontino’s rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through long days’ journey, by that river-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together go the lovely pilgrim pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till they see Arles, and hear the hollow roar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of billows breaking on the sea-beach bare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almost without the suburbs, and before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The furthest barrier, stops the martial fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To furnish Flordelice what time might need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the conveyance of Rogero’s steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She forward rode, within the enclosure sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And o’er the bridge and through the gateway wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (furnished with a guide, who thither led)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To young Rogero’s inn; and there descended.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to the Child, as bid, her message said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave the courser, to her care commended:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then (for she waits not for an answer) speeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In haste to execute her proper needs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero stands confused; he finds no end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his perplexing thoughts, and cannot see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who should defy him, who that message send,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To speak him ill, and do him courtesy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thus as faithless him should reprehend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or any reprehend, whoe’er it be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor knows he nor imagines; least of all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Bradamant the knight’s suspicions fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To think ’twas Rodomont the youthful peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was more inclined than any other wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wherefore even from him he this should hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Muses, nor can the cause divine aright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save him, in all the world the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows not of one, that has him at despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile Dordona’s lady craved the field;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loud that martial damsel’s bugle pealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Agramant and King Marsilius flew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The news, that one craved battle on the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpentine stood by chance before the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gained their leave to don his plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vowed to take that haughty man; the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of people over wall and rampart strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor child nor elder was there, but he pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see which champion should bestir him best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In beauteous arms and costly surcoat drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpentine of the star to combat sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ground he at the first encounter prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if equipt with wings, his courser fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel flew his charger to arrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the bride to that paynim led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaiming; “Mount, and bid your monarch send</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A knight that better can with me contend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Moorish king, that on the rampart’s height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood, with a mighty following, next the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marking the joust, much marvelled at the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the foe’s courtesy to him of Spain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-442" id="noteref-442" epub:type="noteref">442</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He takes him not, although he may of right,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cries i’ the hearing of the paynim train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpentine comes, and, as the maid commands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A better warrior of that king demands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Grandonio de Volterna, fierce of mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in all Spain the proudest cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The second for that fell encounter stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such favour had his suit obtained whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To thee thy courtesy shall do no good,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He threats, “for if unhorsed in the career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A prisoner to my lord shalt thou be led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, if I fight as wonted, thou art dead.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She cries, “I would not thy discourtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should make me so forget my courteous vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that aforehand I should caution thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Back to thy fortress to return again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere on hard earth thy bones shall battered be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Go tell thy king no champion of thy grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I seek, but hither come to crave the fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With warrior that is worthy of my might.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant’s sharp and stinging answer stirred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim’s fury to a mighty flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that, without the power to speak a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wheeled his courser, filled with rage and shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheeling as well, at that proud paynim spurred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her horse with levelled lance the warlike dame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the charmed weapon smites Grandonio’s shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With heels in air, he tumbles on the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him the high-minded damsel gave his horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said, “Yet was this fate to thee foreshown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Instead of craving thus the knightly course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better mine embassy wouldst thou have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some other knight, that equals me in force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I pray thee bid the Moorish king send down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor weary me, by forcing me to meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Champions like thee, untried in martial feat.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They on the walls, that know not who the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the joust so well maintains his seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Name many a warrior, famous in career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That often make them shake in fiercest heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart many deem the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More guesses in renowned Rinaldo meet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many would deem Orlando was the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that they knew his pitiable plight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The third encounter craved Lanfusa’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-443" id="noteref-443" epub:type="noteref">443</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cried, “Not that I better hope to fare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that to warriors who this course have run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My fall may furnish an excuse more fair.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, with all arms that martial jousters don,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clothed him, and of a hundred steeds that were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ready for service, kept in lordly stall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For speed and action chose the best of all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He bowned him for the tournay, on his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first saluted her and she the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If ’tis allowed to ask,” (the lady cried,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Tell me in courtesy how ye are hight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this Ferraù the damsel satisfied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who rarely hid himself form living wight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Ye will I not refuse,” (subjoined the dame,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Albeit I to meet another came.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—“And who?” the Spaniard said:⁠—the maid replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Rogero”; and pronounced the word with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in so saying, her fair face was dyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All over with the rose’s crimson grain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She after added, “Hither have I hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove how justly famed his might and main.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other care have I, no other call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with that gentle youth to try a fall.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spoke the word in all simplicity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which some already may in malice wrest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù replied, “Assured I first must be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of us two is schooled in warfare best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If what has chanced to many, falls on me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hither, when I return, shall be addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mend my fault, that gentle cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom you so desire to break a spear.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Discoursing all this while, the martial maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spake with her beavor up, without disguise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ferraù, as that fair visage he surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perceived he was half vanquished by its eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to himself, in under tone, he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He seems an angel sent from Paradise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though he should not harm me with his lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am already quelled by that sweet glance.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They take their ground, and to the encounter ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like those others, Ferraù goes to ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His courser Bradamant retained, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Return, and keep thy word with me as bound.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shamed, he returned, and by his monarch’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among his peers, the young Rogero found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let the stripling know the stranger knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without the walls, defied him to the fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero (for not yet that warrior knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What champion him in duel would assail)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh sure of victory, with transport glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bids his followers bring his plate and mail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor having seen beneath those heavy blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest dismounted, makes his spirit quail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But how he armed, how sallied, what befell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That knight, in other canto will I tell.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Where’er they be, all hearts of gentle strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still cannot choose but courtesy pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For they from nature and from habit gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What they henceforth can never more undo.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike the heart that is of churlish vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er it be, its evil kind will shew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nature inclines to ill, through all her range,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And use is second nature, hard to change.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Among the warriors of antiquity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much gentleness and courtesy appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Virtues but seldom seen with us; while we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of evil ways, on all sides, see and hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hippolytus, when you, with ensignry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Won from the foe, and with his captive gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Adorned our temples; and his galleys bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laden with prey, to your paternal shore;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All the inhuman deeds which wrought by hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Moor, or Turk, or Tartar ever were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Yet not by the Venetians’ ill command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That evermore the praise of justice bear,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were practised by that foul and evil band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of soldiers, who their mercenaries are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those so many fires not now I tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on our farms and pleasant places fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though a foul vengeance in that blow was meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mainly at you, who being at Caesar’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Padua by his leaguering host was pent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas known, that oft, through you, was turned aside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than one ravening flame, and oft was spent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fire, in fane and village blazing wide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the destined mischief ye withstood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to your inborn courtesy seemed good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This will I pass, nor their so many more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discourteous and despiteous doings tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save one alone, whereat from rock-stone hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whene’er the tale is told warm tears might well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That day you sent your family before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, my lord, where, under omens fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your foes into a well-protected seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abandoning their barks, had made retreat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Hector and Aeneas, mid the flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fire to the banded fleet of Greece applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I Hercules and Alexander viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Urged by too sovereign ardour, side by side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spurring before all others in their mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even within the hostile ramparts ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prick so far, the second ’scaped with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the foremost closed the opposing train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Feruffine ’scaped, the good Cantelmo left,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What counsel, Sora’s duke, was thine, what heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thy bold son thou saw’st, of helm bereft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid a thousand swords, when⁠—dragged apart⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou saw’st his young head from his shoulders cleft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A shipboard, on a plank? I, on my part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marvel, that seeing but the murder done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slew thee not, as the faulchion slew thy son.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cruel Sclavonian! say, whence hast thou brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy ways of warfare? By what Scythian rite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay the helpless prisoner is it taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who yields his arms, nor fends himself in fight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was it a crime he for his country fought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill upon thee the sun bestows his light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remorseless era, which hast filled the page</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Atreus’, Tantalus’, Thyestes’ rage!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Barbarian! thou madest shorter by the head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The boldest of his age, on whom did beam</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun ’twixt pole and pole, ’twixt Indus’ bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where he sinks in Ocean’s western stream;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose years and beauty might have pity bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Anthropophagus, in Polypheme;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not thee; that art in wickedness outdone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By any Cyclops, any Lestrigon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I ween, mid warriors in the days of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No such example was; they all, in field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were full of gentleness and courteous lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor against conquered foe their bosom steeled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only gentle Bradamant forbore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To harm the knights whom, smitten on the shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her lance unhorsed; but for the vanquished crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Detained their steeds, that they might mount anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I of that lady fair, of mickle might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told you above, how she had overthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serpentine of the Star in single fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grandonio and Ferraù, and then upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their coursers had replaced each baffled knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I told moreover how the third was gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero to defy to the career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her call, who seemed a cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero heard the call in joyous vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade his arms be brought; now while in view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Agramant he donned the plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those lords the former question moved anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who was the knight, that on the martial plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The manage of the lance so quaintly knew?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of Ferraù, who spake with him whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Craved, if to him was known that cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Be ye assured,” to them Ferraù replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He is not one of those I hear you cite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me (for I his open face descried).</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s youthful brother seemed the knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But since his doughty valour I have tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wot not such is Richardetto’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I ween it is his sister, who, I hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resembles much in mien that martial peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The damsel equals well, so Rumour tells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, and every paladin in fray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But brother she and cousin<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-444" id="noteref-444" epub:type="noteref">444</a> both excels,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Measured by that which I have seen to-day.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing him, while upon her praise he dwells,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the sky reddens with the morning ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s face is flushed with crimson hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his heart throbs, nor knows he what to do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stung, at these tidings, by the amorous dart⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within, new fire inflames the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strait, together with the burning smart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shoots through his bones a chill, produced by fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fear, that new wrath had stifled in her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That mighty love, wherewith she burned whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Confused he stands, irresolute and slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And undecided if to stay or go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now fierce Marphisa, who was there, and prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By huge desire to meet the stranger wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And armed withal (for, save in iron vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her seldom would you find by day or night),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing Rogero is in armour drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing to lose the honour of the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If first that champion with the stranger vies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinks to prevent the youth and win the prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She leapt upon her horse, and thither hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Aymon’s daughter on the listed plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With palpitating heart, upon her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waited Rogero; whom the damsel fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would make her prisoner, and but schemed to guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her lance in mode the stripling least to pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa from the city portal fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on her gallant helm a phoenix wears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether the maid would publish, in her pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she was single in the world, for might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or whether by that symbol signified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she would live, exempt from bridal rite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her closely Aymon’s martial daughter eyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When seeing not those features, her delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She craves the damsel’s name before they move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hears that it is she who joys her love:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Or rather she, that gentle lady thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had joyed her love; and whom she hated so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to Death’s door her anger would have brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless she venged her sorrow on the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wheeled her courser round, with fury fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less with desire to lay her rival low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than with the lance to pierce her in mid breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put her every jealousy at rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Parforce to ground must go the royal maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove it hard or soft the listed plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be with such unwonted scorn appaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she is nearly maddened by disdain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce was she thrown, before her trenchant blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She bared, and hurried to avenge the stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cried Aymon’s daughter, no less proud of heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What art thou doing? Thou my prisoner art.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Though I have courtesy for others, none”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(She said) “from me, Marphisa, shalt thou find.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since evermore I hear of thee, as one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pride and every churlishness inclined.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, at these words, was heard to groan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As roars in some sea-rock the prisoned wind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She screamed an answer; but its sense was drowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such rage confused that damsel) in the sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She whirls this while her faulchion, and would fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wound horse or rider in the paunch or breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Aymon’s watchful daughter turns the rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on one side her courser leaps; possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With furious anger and with fierce disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She at her opposite her lance addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hardly touched the damsel, ere, astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa fell, reversed upon the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarce down, Marphisa started from the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent fell mischief with her sword to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant couched her golden spear again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet again the damsel overthrew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet Bradamant, though blest with might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was not so much the stronger of the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to have flung the maid in every just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that such power was in the lance’s thrust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while some knights (some knights upon our side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say) forth issuing from the city, go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the field of strife, which did divide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The squadrons, here and there, of either foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Not half a league of one another wide⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing their knight such mighty prowess show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>Their</em> knight, but whom no otherwise they knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than as a warrior of the Christian crew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Troyano’s generous son, who had espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This band approaching to the city-wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For due defence would every means provide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every peril, every case forestall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And orders many to take arms, who ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth from the ramparts, at the monarch’s call.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With them Rogero goes, in armour cased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Balked of the battle by Marphisa’s haste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The enamoured youth, with beating heart, intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood by, the issue of the just to view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For his dear cousin fearing the event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he well Marphisa’s valour knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—At the beginning I would say⁠—when, bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On mischief, fiercely closed the furious two:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when that duel’s turn the stripling eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stands amazed and stupid with surprise;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when he saw unfinished was the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the first onset, like the justs whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Misdoubting some strange accident, in sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore vexed, this while remained the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To either maid wished well that youthful knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For both were loved, but not alike were dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For <em>this</em> the stripling’s love was fury, fire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For <em>that</em> ’twas rather fondness than desire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If so Rogero could with honour do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He willingly the warriors would divide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his companions, in the fear to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Victory with King Charles’s knight abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteeming him the better of the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Break in between and turn their arms aside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the other part, the Christian foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Advance, and both divisions come to blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On this side and that other, rings the alarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in those camps is sounded every day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding the unmounted mount, the unarmed arm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all their standards seek, without delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, under separate flags, the squadrons swarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than one shrilling trump is heard to bray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as their rattling notes the riders call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rousing the foot, beat drum and ataball.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As fierce as thought could think, ’twixt either host</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kindled the fell and sanguinary fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The daring damsel, fair Dordona’s boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore vexed and troubled, that in the affray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She cannot compass what she covets most,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Marphisa with avenging steel to slay⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here, not there, amid the medley flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping to see the youth for whom she sighs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By the eagle argent on the shield of blue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She recognized Rogero, mid the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With eyes and thought intent, she stops to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior’s manly shoulders and his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair face and movements full of graceful shew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then the maid, with mickle spite possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking another joys the stripling’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus speaks, as sovereign rage and fury move.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Shall then another kiss those lips so bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sweet, if those fair lips are lost to me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! never other shall in thee delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For it not mine, no other’s shalt thou be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than die alone and of despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I with this hand will slay myself and thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That if I lose thee here, at least in hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thee I to eternity may dwell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If thou slay’st me, there is good reason, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The comfort too of vengeance should obtain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that all edicts and all equity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The death of him that causes death ordain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, since you justly, I unjustly, die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deem I that thine is equal to my pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I him who seeks my life, alas! shall spill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou her that loves and worships thee wouldst kill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My hand, why hast thou not the hardiment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rive with steel the bosom of my foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That me so many times to death has shent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under the faith of love, in peaceful show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, who to take my life can now consent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor even have pity of my cruel woe?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dare, valiant heart, this impious man to slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let his death my thousand deaths appay!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said, she spurred at him amid the throng;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, first⁠—“Defend thee, false Rogero!”⁠—cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“No more, if I have power, in spoil and wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Done to a virgin heart, shalt thou take pride.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing that voice the hostile ranks among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deems⁠—and truly deems⁠—he hears his bride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose voice the youth remembers in such wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> mid a thousand would he recognize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her further meaning well did he divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weening that him she in that speech would blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For having broke their pact; and⁠—with design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The occasion of his failure to proclaim⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his desire for parley made a sign:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she, with vizor closed, already came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raging and grieved, intent, with vengeful hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fling the youth; nor haply upon sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, when he saw her so offended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixed himself firmly in his arms and seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rests his lance, but holds the stave suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that it shall not harm her when they meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She that to smite and pierce the Child intended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pitiless, and inflamed with furious heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has not the courage, when she sees him near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fling, or do him outrage with the spear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Void of effect, ’tis thus their lances go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it is well; since Love with burning dart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tilting this while at one and the other foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has lanced the enamoured warriors in mid-heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unable at the Child to aim her blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady spent her rage in other part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mighty deeds achieved, which fame will earn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While overhead the circling heavens shall turn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above three hundred men in that affray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In little space by her dismounted lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone that warlike damsel wins the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her alone the Moorish people fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her Rogero, circling, threads his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And says; “Unless I speak with you I die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hear me, for love of heaven!⁠—what done I done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! that ever mine approach ye shun?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when soft southern breezes are unpent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which with a tepid breath from seaward blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The snows dissolve, and torrents find a vent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ice, so hard erewhile, is seen to flow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At those entreaties, at that brief lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s sister’s heart is softened so;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith compassionate and pious grown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which anger fain had made more hard than stone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Would she not, could she not, she nought replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But spurred aslant the ready Rabicane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, signing to Rogero, rode as wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As she could wend from that embattled train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to a sheltered valley turned aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein embosomed was a little plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the mid lawn a wood of cypress grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose saplings of one stamp appeared to view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within that thicket, of white marble wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is a proud monument, and newly made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he that makes enquiry, here is taught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In few brief verses who therein is laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But of those lines, methinks, took little thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair Bradamant, arriving in that glade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero spurred his courser, and pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And overtook that damsel in the wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But turn we to Marphisa, that anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">During this space was seated on her steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sought again the valiant champion, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the first onset cast her on the mead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw, how from the mingling host withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, after that strange knight to speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deemed the youth pursued in love; she thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He but to end their strife and quarrel sought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She pricks her horse behind the two, and gains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well nigh as soon as they, that valley; how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her coming thither either lover pains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lives and loves, untaught by me, may know:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But sorest vext sad Bradamant remains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholding her whence all her sorrows flow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who shall persuade the damsel but that love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For young Rogero brings her to that grove?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And him perfidious she anew did name.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“Perfidious, was it not enough (she said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I should know thy perfidy from fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But must the witness of thy guilt be made?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I wot, to drive me from thee is thine aim;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I, that thy desires may be appaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will die; but strive, in yielding up my breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She too shall die, the occasion of my death.”</span>

				<span>Angrier than venomed viper, with a bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, she upon Marphisa flies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plants so well the spear, that she, astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell backward on the champaigne in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh half her helm was buried in the ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was the damsel taken by surprise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, did her best the encounter to withstand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet with her helmed head she smote the sand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant who will die, or in that just</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will put to death Marphisa, rages so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She has no mind again with lance to thrust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again that martial maid to overthrow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But thinks her head to sever from the bust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where it half buried lies, with murderous blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Away the enchanted lance that damsel flings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unsheathes the sword, and from her courser springs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But is too slow withal; for on her feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She finds Marphisa, with such fierce disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed, at being in that second heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So easily reversed upon the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She hears in vain exclaim, in vain entreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, who beholds their strife with pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So blinded are the pair with spite and rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they with desperate fury battle wage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At half-sword’s engage the struggling foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—such their stubborn mood⁠—with shortened brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They still approach, and now so fiercely close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They cannot choose but grapple, hand to hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her sword, no longer needful, each foregoes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And either now new means of mischief planned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero both implores with earnest suit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But supplicates the twain with little fruit.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he entreaties unavailing found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth prepared by force to part the two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their poniards snatched away, and on the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath a cypress-tree, the daggers threw.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they no weapons have wherewith to wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With prayer and threat, he interferes anew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But vainly; for, since better weapons lack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each other they with fists and feet attack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero ceased not from his task; he caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By hand or arm, the fiercely struggling pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till to the utmost pitch of fury wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fell Marphisa’s angry passions were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, that this ample world esteemed at nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the Child’s friendship had no further care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plucked from the foe, she ran to seize her sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fastened next upon that youthful lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Like a discourteous man and churl ye do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, to disturb another’s fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A deed (she cried) this hand shall make ye rue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which I intend, shall vanquished both.” The knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought fierce Marphisa’s fury to subdue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gentle speech; but full of such despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He found her, and inflamed with such disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All parley was a waste of time and pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At last his faulchion young Rogero drew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ire as well had flushed that cavalier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is it my belief, that ever shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Athens or Rome, or city whatsoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Witnessed, which ever so rejoiced the view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As this rejoices, as this sight is dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Bradamant, when, through their strife displaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Every suspicion from her breast is chased.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant took her sword, and to descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The duel of those champions stood apart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The god of war, descended from the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She deemed Rogero, for his strength and art:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he seemed Mars, Marphisa to the eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed an infernal Fury, on her part.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis true, that for a while the youthful knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against that damsel put not forth his might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He knew the virtues of that weapon well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such proof thereof the knight erewhile had made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er it falls parforce is every spell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Annulled, or by its stronger virtue stayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence so Rogero smote, it never fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon its edge or point, but still the blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descended flat: he long this rule observes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet once he from his patient purpose swerves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that, a mighty stroke Marphisa sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meaning to cleave the brainpan of her foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He raised the buckler to defend his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the sword smote upon its bird of snow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor broke nor bruised the shield, by spell bested;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his arm rang astounded by the blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor aught but Hector’s mail the sword had stopt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose furious blow would his left arm have lopt;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And had upon his head descended shear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereat designed to strike the savage fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce his left arm can good Rogero rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can scarce the shield and blazoned bird upbear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All pity he casts off, and ’twould appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in his eyes a lighted torch did glare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As hard as he can smite, he smites; and woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee, Marphisa, if he plants the blow!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I cannot tell you truly in what wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That faulchion swerves against a cypress-stock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such close-serried ranks the saplings rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Buried above a palm within the block.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As this the mountain and the plain that lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath it, with a furious earthquake rock;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from that marble monument proceeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A voice, that every mortal voice exceeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The horrid voice exclaims, “Your quarrel leave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’twere a deed unjust and inhumane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That brother should of life his sister reave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or sister by her brother’s hand be slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero and Marphisa mine, believe!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tale which I deliver is not vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seed of one father, on one womb ye lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And first together saw the light of day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Galaciëlla’s children are ye, whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to Rogero, hight the second, bare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose brothers, having, by unrighteous doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of your unhappy sire deprived that fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not heeding that she carried in her womb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye, who yet suckers of their lineage are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her in a rotten carcase of a boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To founder in mid ocean, set afloat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But Fortune, that had destined you whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet unborn, to many a fair emprize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your mother to that lonely shore did steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which overright the sandy Syrtes lies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, having given you birth, that spirit dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith ascended into Paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A witness of the piteous case was I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Heaven had willed, and such your destiny!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I to the dame as descent burial gave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As could be given upon that desert sand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye, well enveloped in my vest, I save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bear to Mount Carena from the strand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And make a lioness leave whelps and cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issue from the wood, with semblance bland.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye, twice ten months, with mickle fondness bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from her paps the milky mother fed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Needing to quit my home upon a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And journey through the country, (as you can</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply remember ye) we are on our way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were overtaken by an Arab clan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those robbers thee, Marphisa, bore away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While young Rogero ’scaped, who better ran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bereaved of thee, they woful loss I wept,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with more watchful care thy brother kept.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rogero, if Atlantes watched thee well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While yet he was alive, thou best dost know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I the fixed stars had heard of thee foretell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou shouldst perish by a treacherous foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Christian land; and still their influence fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ended, laboured to avert the blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor having power in fine thy will to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I sickened sore, and of my sorrow died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But here, before my death, for in this glade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I knew thou should’st with bold Marphisa fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I with huge stones, amassed by hellish aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had this fair monument of marble dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I to Charon with loud outcries said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘I would not he should hence convey my sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till here, prepared in deadly fray to strive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero and his sister should arrive.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thus has my spirit for this many a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waited thy coming in these beauteous groves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So be no more to jealous fears a prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O Bradamant, because Rogero loves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But me to quit the cheerful realms of day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seek the darksome cloisters it behoves.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here ceased the voice; which in the Child amazed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those two damsels mighty marvel raised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gladly a sister in the martial queen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, she in him a brother knows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who now embrace, nor move her jealous spleen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with the love of young Rogero glows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And citing what, and when, and where had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their childish deeds, as they to memory rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In summing up past times, more sure they hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The things whereof the wizard’s spirit told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero from Marphisa does not hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Bradamant to him at heart is dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by what obligations he is tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In moving words relates the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ceases till he has, on either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turned to firm love the hate they bore whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, as a sign of peace, and discord chased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, at his bidding, tenderly embraced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa to Rogero makes request</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To say what sire was theirs, and what their strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he died; by banded foes opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or at close barriers, was the warrior slain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who it was had issued the behest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To drown their mother in the stormy main?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For of the tale, if ever heard before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little or nothing she in memory bore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of Trojan ancestors are we the seed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through famous Hector’s line,” (Rogero said,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For after young Astyanax was freed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-445" id="noteref-445" epub:type="noteref">445</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From fierce Ulysses and the toils he spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving another stripling in his stead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his own age, he out of Phrygia fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, after long and wide sea-wandering, gained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sicily’s shore, and in Messina reigned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Part of Calabria within Faro held</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior’s heirs, who after a long run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of successors, departed thence and dwelled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Mars’ imperial city: more than one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Famed king and emperor, who that list have swelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Rome and other part has filled the throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from Constantius and good Constantine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stretched to the son of Pepin, is their line.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rogero, Gambaron, Buovo hence succeed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that Rogero, second of the name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who filled our fruitful mother with his seed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As thou Atlantes may’st have heard proclaim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of our fair lineage many a noble deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shalt thou hear blazed abroad by sounding Fame.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Of Agolant’s inroad next the stripling told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Agramant and with Almontes bold;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And how a lovely daughter, who excelled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In feats of arms, that king accompanied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So stout she many paladins had quelled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how, in fine, she for Rogero sighed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for his love against her sire rebelled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was baptised, and was Rogero’s bride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how a traitor loved (him Bertram name)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His brother’s wife with an incestuous flame;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And country, sire, and brethren two betrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping he so the lady should have won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Risa open to the foe he laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom all scathe was on those kinsmen done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Agolant’s two furious sons conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their mother, great with child, and six months gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aboard a helmless boat, and with its charge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In wildest winter, turned adrift the barge.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valiant Marphisa, with a tranquil face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard young Rogero thus his tale pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joyed to be descended of a race</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from so fair a font its waters drew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence Clermont, whence renowned Mongrana trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their noble line, the martial damsel knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blazoned through years and centuries by Fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unrivalled, both, in arms of mighty name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When afterwards she from her brother knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant’s uncle, sire, and grandsire fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In treacherous wise, the first Rogero slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And brought to cruel pass Galacielle,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa could not hear the story through:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him she cries, “With pardon, what you tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brother, convicts you of too foul a wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In leaving thus our sire unvenged so long.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Could’st thou not in Almontes and Troyane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As dead whilere, your thirsty faulchion plant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By you those monarch’s children might be slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are you alive, and lives King Agramant?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never will you efface the shameful stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ye, so often wronged, not only grant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Life to that king, but as your lord obey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lodge in his court, and serve him for his pay?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Here heartily in face of Heaven I vow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> Christ my father worshipped, to adore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And till I venge my parents on the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wear this armour, and I will deplore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your deed, Rogero, and deplore even now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you should swell the squadrons of the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or other follower of the Moslem faith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save sword in hand, and to the paynim’s scathe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ah! how fair Bradamant uplifts again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her visage at that speech, rejoiced in sprite!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero she exhorts in earnest vein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To do as his Marphisa counsels right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bids him seek the camp of Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And have himself acknowledged in his sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who so reveres and lauds his father’s worth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He even deems him one unmatched on earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In the beginning so he should have done,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Warily young Rogero answer made,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“But, for the tale was not so fully known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As since, the deed had been too long delayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, seeing it was fierce Troyano’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That had begirt him with the knightly blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, as a traitor, well might be abhorred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he slew one, accepted as his lord.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, as to Bradamant whilere, he cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He will all measures and all means assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereby some fair occasion may arise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave the king; and had there been delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he whilere had done in otherwise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She on the Tartar king the fault must lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How sorely handled that redoubted foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had left him in their battle, she must know;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And she, that every day had sought his bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must of this truth the fittest witness be.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much upon this was answered, much was said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between those damsels, who at last agree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as their last resolve, last counsel read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should rejoin the paynim’s ensignry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he found fair occasion to resort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Agramant’s to Charles’s royal court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Bradamant the bold Marphisa cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Let him begone, nor doubt am I, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many days pass, will manage in such wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Agramant shall be his lord no more.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So says the martial damsel, nor implies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The secret purpose which she has in store.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Making his congees to the friendly twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To join his king Rogero turns the rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When a complaint is heard from valley near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All now stand listening, to the noise attent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to that plaintive voice incline their ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A woman’s (as ’twould seem) that makes lament.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I this strain would gladly finish here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, that I finish it, be ye content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For better things I promise to report,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ye to hear another strain resort.</span>

					<span>Lament and outcry loud of some that mourn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attract Rogero and the damsels two.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They find Ulania, with her mantle shorn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Marganor, amid her moaning crew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon that felon knight, for his foul scorn,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>

			<p>
				<span>If, as in seeking other gift to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For Nature, without study, yieldeth nought)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With mighty diligence, and mickle pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Illustrious women day and night have wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if with good success the female train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a fair end no homely task have brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So⁠—did they for such other studies wake⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As mortal attributes immortal make;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, if they of themselves sufficient were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their praises to posterity to show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor borrowed authors’ aid, whose bosoms are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With envy and with hate corroded so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That oft they hide the good they might declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tell in every place what ill they know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To such a pitch would mount the female name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As haply ne’er was reached by manly fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To furnish mutual aid is not enow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many who would lend each other light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men do their best, that womankind should show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever faults they have in open sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would hinder them of rising from below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sink them to the bottom, if they might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say the ancients; as if glory, won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By woman, dimmed their own, as mist the sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But hands or tongue ne’er had, nor has, the skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does voice or lettered page the thought impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though each, with all its power, increase the ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Diminishing the good with all its art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So female fame to stifle, but that still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The honour of the sex survives in part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet reacheth not its pitch, nor such its flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that ’tis far below its natural height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not only Thomyris and Harpalicé,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who brought Hector, who brought Turnus aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who, to build in Lybia crost the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Tyrian and Sidonian band obeyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only famed Zenobia, only she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who Persian, Indian, and Assyrian frayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only these and some few others merit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their glory, that eternal fame inherit:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Faithful, chaste, and bold, the world hath seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Greece and Rome not only, but where’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Sun unfolds his flowing locks, between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Hesperides and Indian hemisphere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose gifts and praise have so extinguished been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We scarce of one amid a thousand hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this because they in their days have had</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For chroniclers, men envious, false, and bad.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But ye that prosper in the exercise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of goodly labours, aye your way pursue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor halt, O women, in your high emprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For fear of not receiving honour due:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, as nought good endures beneath the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So ill endures no more; if hitherto</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfriendly by the poet’s pen and page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They now befriend you in our better age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Erewhile Marullo<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-446" id="noteref-446" epub:type="noteref">446</a> and Pontante for you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Declared, and⁠—sire and son⁠—the Strozzi twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Capello, Bembo, and that writer, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has fashioned like himself the courtier train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Lewis Alamanni, and those two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beloved of Mars and Muses, of their strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descended, who the mighty city rule,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Mincius parts, and moats with marshy pool.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-447" id="noteref-447" epub:type="noteref">447</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One of this pair (besides that, of his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He honours you, and does you courtesies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes Parnassus and high Cynthus’ hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resound your praise, and lift it to the skies)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The love, the faith, and mind, unconquered still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid threats of ruin, which in steadfast wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him his constant Isabel hath shown,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-448" id="noteref-448" epub:type="noteref">448</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Render yet more your champion than his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So that he never more will wearied be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With quickening in his verse your high renown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if another censures you, than he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prompter to arm in your defence is none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor knight, in this wide world, more willingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Life in the cause of virtue would lay down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Matter as well for other’s pen he gives,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in his own another’s glory lives;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And well he merits, that a dame so blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Blest with all worth, which in this earthly round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is seen in them who don the female vest,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him hath evermore been faithful found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a sure pillar of pure truth possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her, despising Fortune’s every wound.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-449" id="noteref-449" epub:type="noteref">449</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy of one another are the twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor better ere were paired in wedlock’s chain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>New trophies he on Oglio’s bank has shown;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-450" id="noteref-450" epub:type="noteref">44</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he, mid bark and car, amid the gleam</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fire and sword, such goodly rhymes hath strown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As may with envy swell the neighbouring stream.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Hercules Bentivòglio next is blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The noble strain, your honour’s noble theme;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reynet Trivulzio and Guidetti mine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Molza, called of Phoebus and the Nine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There’s Hercules of the Carnuti,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-451" id="noteref-451" epub:type="noteref">451</a> son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of my own duke, who spreads his every plume</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Soaring and singing, like harmonious swan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And even to heaven uplifts your name; with whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is my lord of Guasto, not alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A theme for many an Athens, many a Rome;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his high strain he promises as well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your praise to all posterity to tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And beside these and others of our day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who gave you once, or give you now renown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This for yourselves ye may yourselves purvey:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many, laying silk and sampler down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the melodious Muses, to allay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their thirst at Aganippe’s well, have gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still are going; who so fairly speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we more theirs than they our labour need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If I of these would separately tell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And render good account and honour due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than one page I with their praise should swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ought beside would this day’s canto shew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if on five or six alone I dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I may offend and anger all the crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What then shall I resolve? to pass all by?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or choose but one from such a company?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One will I choose, and such will choose, that she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All envy shall so well have overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other woman can offend be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If, passing others, her I praise alone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor joys this one but immortality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through her sweet style (and better know I none);</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But who is honoured in her speech and page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall burst the tomb, and live through every age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Phoebus to his silvery sister shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His visage more, and lends her brighter fires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Venus, Maja, or to star that glows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone, or circles with the heavenly choirs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So he with sweeter eloquence than flows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From other lips, that gentle dame inspires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gives her word such force, a second sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seems in our days its glorious course to run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Mid victories born, Victoria is her name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-452" id="noteref-452" epub:type="noteref">452</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well named; and whom (does she advance or stay)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Triumphs and trophies evermore proclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Victory heads or follows her array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another Artemisia is the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renowned for love of her Mausolus, yea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By so much greater, as it is more brave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To raise the dead, than lay them in the grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If chaste Laodamia, Portia true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evadne, Argìa, Arria,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-453" id="noteref-453" epub:type="noteref">453</a> and many more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Merited praise, because that glorious crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Coveted burial with their lords of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How much more fame is to Victoria due?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from dull Lethe, and the river’s shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which nine times hems the ghosts, to upper light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has dragged her lord, in death and fate’s despite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If that loud-voiced Maeonian trump whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Macedonian grudged Achilles, how,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Francis Pescara, O unconquered peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would he begrudge thee, were he living now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That wife, so virtuous and to thee so dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy well-earned glory through the world should blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that thy name through her should so rebound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou needst not crave a clearer trumpet’s sound!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If all that is to tell, and all I fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would of that lady tell, I wished to unfold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though long, yet not so long, would be the stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that large portion would be left untold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While at a stand the story would remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fierce Marphisa and her comrades bold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To follow whom I promised erst, if you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would but return to hear my song anew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now, being here to listen to my say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because I would not break my promise, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until my better leisure, will delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her every praise at length to certify.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that I think she needs my humble lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with such treasure can herself supply:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But simply to appay my single end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gentle dame to honour and commend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ladies, in fine I say, that every age</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy of story, many a dame supplies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that, through jealous authors’ envious rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unchronicled by fame, each matron dies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But will no more; since in the historic page</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your virtues ye, yourselves, immortalize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had those two damsels in this art been read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their every warlike deed had wider spread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant and Marphisa would I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose bold, victorious deeds, in battle done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I strive to bring into the light of day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But nine in ten remain to me unknown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I what I know right willingly display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well, that all fair actions should be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well that, gentle ladies, I am bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye whom I love and honour, to content.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As said, in act to go Rogero stood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, having taken leave, the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Withdraws his trenchant faulchion from the wood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which holds no more the weapon, as whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, sounding loud amid that solitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cry, not distant far, arrests the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then thitherward he with those damsels made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prompt, if ’twere needed, to bestow his aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They rode an-end; and louder waxed the sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plainer were the plaintive words they heard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in a valley they three women found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Making that plaint, who in strange garb appeared:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For to the navel were those three ungowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Their coats by some uncourteous varlet sheared⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knowing not how better to disguise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their shame, they sate on earth, and dared not rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As Vulcan’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-454" id="noteref-454" epub:type="noteref">454</a> that sprang (as it is versed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of the dust, without a mother made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom⁠—so Minerva bade⁠—Aglauros nursed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sovereign care, too bold and curious maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seated in car, by him constructed first</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hide his hideous feet, was erst conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that which never is to sight revealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sitting, those mournful damsels kept concealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At that dishonest sight and shameful, glows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each martial damsel’s visage, overspread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the rich dyes of Paestum’s crimson rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When vernal airs their gentle influence shed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant marked them; and that one of those</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was Ulany, the damsel quickly read;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ulany, that was sent with solemn train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the <b>Lost Isle</b> to royal Charlemagne;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And recognised the other two no less;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From them she saw, when she saw Ulany;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now to her directed her address,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the most honoured of those ladies three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Demanding, who so full of wickedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So lawless was and so unmannerly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he those secrets to the sight revealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Nature, as she could, ’twould seem, concealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ulany, that in Bradamant descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Known both by voice and ensignry⁠—the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who some few days before those knights of pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her victorious lance on earth had laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How, in a town not far remote”⁠—replied⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“An evil race, by pity never swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides that they their raiment thus had shorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had beat them, and had done them other scorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What of the shield became,” she cannot say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor knows she those three monarchs’ destiny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who guided her so long upon her way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If killed, or led into captivity;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And says, “that she herself has ta’en her way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit to fare afoot sore irksome be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To appeal to royal Charlemagne, assured</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him such outrage will not be endured.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To hear, yet more to see, so foul a wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disturbed the Child and damsels’ placid air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And beauteous visage, whose bold hearts and strong</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less compassionate than valiant were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They now, all else forgetting, ere the tongue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Ulany prefers demand, or prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they would venge them on their cruel foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In haste towards the felon’s castle go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With one constant, the maids and cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By their great goodness moved, from plate and mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had stript their upper vests, well fitting gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those miserable ladies’ shame to veil.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant suffers not, that, as whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sad Ulany shall tramp by hill and dale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But seats her on her horse’s croup; so do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her comrades by those other damsels two.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To gentle Bradamant Ulania showed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The nearest way to reach the castle height;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While comfort Bradamant on her bestowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Promising vengeance for that foul despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They leave the vale, and by a crooked road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And long ascend, now wheeling left, now right:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor till the sun is hidden in the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon their weary way repose the three.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They to a hamlet on the summit wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scaling the mountain’s steep and rugged side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such good shelter and good supper found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As could by such rude quarters be supplied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arriving there, they turned their eyes around,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And full of women every place espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some old, some young; nor, mid so large a clan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared the visage of a single man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not more bold Jason wondered,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-455" id="noteref-455" epub:type="noteref">455</a> and the train</span>

				<span class="i1">Seeing those dames that had their husbands slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fathers and sons and brethren⁠—so that through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All Lemnos’ pleasant isle, by hill or plain,</span>

				<span class="i1">Of manly visage they beheld not two⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than here Rogero, and the rest who go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With good Rogero, wonder at this show.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The martial damsels bid for Ulany,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those who came with her, provide attire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gowns that eve are furnished for the three,</span>

				<span class="i1">If meaner than their own, at least entire.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where are the men; in that he none descries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus to him that village wife replies:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What haply is to you a wonderment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This crowd of womankind, where man is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To us is grave and grievous punishment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, banished here, live wofully alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, that such exile us may more torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From those so loved, as brother, father, son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A long divorce and cruel we sustain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As our fell tyrant pleases to ordain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sent to these confines from his land, which lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But two leagues distant thence, where we were born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Us in this place the fell barbarian sties,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having first done us many a brutal scorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And has with death and all extremities</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threatened our kinsmen and ourselves forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If they come hither, or he hears report</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We harbour them, when hither they resort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He to our name is such a deadly foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will not have us nearer than I shewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now have us of our kin approached, as though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Infection from the female sex ensued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already have the greenwood trees laid low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their leafy honours twice, and twice renewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since our lord’s fury to such pitch arose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now is there one his frenzy to oppose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For he has spread such passing fear among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people, death can cause no worse affright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, beside his natural love of wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is endowed with more than human might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He than a hundred other men more strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In body is of a gigantic height:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor us his vassals he molests alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But worse by him to stranger dame is done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If your own honour, sir, and of those three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath your charge, to you in aught is dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twill safer, usefuller, and better be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To leave this road, and by another steer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This leads you to <em>his</em> tower, described by me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To prove the savage use that cruel peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has there established, to the shame and woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of dame or cavalier, who thither go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This castellain or tyrant, Marganor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So name the felon knight), than whom more fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nero was not, nor other heretofore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If other be, whose actions Fame doth swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thirsts for man’s blood, but thirsts for woman’s more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than wolf for blood of lambs; and bids expel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With shame all females, that, in evil hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their fortune has conducted to his tower.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How in that impious man such fury grew,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Asked young Rogero and those damsels twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prayed she would in courtesy pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Yea, rather from the first her tale explain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That castle’s lord (the woman said anew)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was always cruel, fierce, and inhumane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet for a while his wicked heart concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor what he was so suddenly revealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For in the lifetime of his sons, a pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That differed much from the paternal style,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Since they the stranger loved; and loathers were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of cruelty and other actions vile)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flourished the courtesies and good customs there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there were gentle deeds performed this while:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, albeit avaricious was the sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never crossed the youths in their desire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The cavaliers and dames who journeyed by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That castle, there so well were entertained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they departed, by the courtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those two kindly brothers wholly gained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the holy orders of fair chivalry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-456" id="noteref-456" epub:type="noteref">456</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike the youthful pair had been ordained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cylander one, Tanacro hight the other;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold, and of royal mien each martial brother;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And truly were, and would have been alway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy of every praise and fame, withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had they not yielded up themselves a prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that uncurbed desire, which Love we call;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which they were seduced from the right way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into foul Error’s crooked maze; and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The good that by those brethren had been wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waxed, in a moment, rank, corrupt and naught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It chanced, that in their father’s fortilage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A knight of the Greek emperor’s court did lie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him his lady was; of manners sage;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor fairer could be craved by wishful eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her Cylander felt such amorous rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deemed, save he enjoyed her, he should die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deemed that, when the lady should depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His soul as well would from his body part:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, for he knew ’twas useless to entreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Devised to make her his by force of hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed, and in silence, near his father’s seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where must pass knight and lady, took his stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through natural daring and through amorous heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with too little thought the matter planned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that, when he beheld the knight advance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He issued, to assail him, lance to lance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To overthrow him, at first shock he thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to win dame and palm in the career;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that Greek knight, in warlike strife well-taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shivered, like glass, his breast-plate with the spear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bitter tidings to the sire were brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bade bear home the stripling on a bier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, finding he was dead, loud mourning made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him in earth, beside his fathers, laid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet harbourage and welcome as before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he who sought it; neither more nor less:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because Tanacro in his courteous lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equalled his brother as in gentleness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither that very year, from foreign shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A baron and his wife their steps address:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A marvel he of valour, and as fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As could be said, is she, and debonnair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No fairer was the dame than chaste and right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well deserving every praise; the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Derived of generous stock, and bold in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As ever champion, of whose fame we hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ’tis well fitting, that such valiant wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should joy a thing so excellent and dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olindro he, the lord of Lungavilla,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, his lady wife, yclept Drusilla.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“No less for her the young Tanacro glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than for that other burned Cylander sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who brought erewhile to sad and bitter close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wicked love he to that lady bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy, hospitable laws he chose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To violate no less than he, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would endure, that him, with venomed sting,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His new desire to cruel death should bring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But he, because he has before his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The example of his elder brother slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinks to bear off the lady in such wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That bold Olindro cannot venge the stain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Straight spent in him, not simply weakened, lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The virtue, wont Tancaro to sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above that flood of vice, in whose profound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And miry waters Marganor lay drowned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That night, he in deep silence bade array</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A score of armed men; and next conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into some caverns, bordering on the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And distant from the tower, his ambuscade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The roads were broken, and the following day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olindro from all sides was overlaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though he made a brave defence and long,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wife and life was plundered by that throng.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Olindro slain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-457" id="noteref-457" epub:type="noteref">457</a> they led his lady fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A captive thence, o’erwhelmed with sorrow so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she refused to live, and made her prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tanacro, as a grace, would death bestow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved to die, she leapt, in her despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From a high bank into a vale below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But death was to the wretched dame refused;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lay with shattered head and sorely bruised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She could not to the castle be conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other guise than borne upon a bier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her (so Tanacro bids) prompt leeches aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he will not lose a prey so dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And while to cure Drusilla they essayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Busied about their spousals was the peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that so chaste a lady and so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wife’s and not a leman’s name should wear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He had no other thought, no other aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other care, nor spake beside of ought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw he had wronged her, and took all the blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as he could, to amend his error wrought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all was vain; the more he loved the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The more be to appease her anger sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much more was her hate; so much more will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much more thirst had she that youth to kill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet hatred blinded not her judgment so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what the dame could clearly comprehend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she, if she would strike the purposed blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must feign, and secret snares for him extend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her desire beneath another show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Which is but how Tanacro to offend)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must mask; and make him think, that overblown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is her first love, and turned to him alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her face speaks peace; while vengeance inwardly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her heart demands, and but to this attends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She many things revolves, accepts, puts by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, as of doubtful issue, some suspends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming she can, if she resolves to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Compass her scheme, with this resolve she ends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better how can she expend her breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in avenging dear Olindro’s death?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She showed herself all joyful, on her part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And feigned that she desired those nuptials sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only showed an unreluctant heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all delay and hindrance overbore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Painted and tired above the rest with art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem, she of her husband thinks no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ’tis her will, that in her country’s wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tanacro shall their wedding solemnize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The custom howsoever was not true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which as her country’s use she certified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, because never thought within her grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which she could spend on any thing beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A falsehood she devised, whence hope she drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of killing him by whom her husband died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told Tanacro⁠—and the manner said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How in her country’s fashion she would wed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘The widow that a husband’s bed ascends,</span>

				<span class="i1">Must soothe with solemn office, mass and prayer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the holy temple making her amends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where her first husband’s bones entombed are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—That sacrifice performed⁠—to bind their vows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The nuptial ring the bridegroom gives the spouse.</span>

				<span class="i1">Then from the flask into a cup pour out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And give the blessed wine to them that wed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ’tis the spouse’s part to take the cup;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And first that vessel’s cordial beverage sup.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The unsuspecting youth, who takes no heed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What nuptials, ordered in her wise, import,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At her own pleasure bids the dame proceed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that she cut his terms of waiting short;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor does the miserable stripling read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She would avenge Olindro in that sort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on one object is so sore intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees but that, on that alone is bent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“An ancient woman, seized with her whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And left, withal, obeyed Drusilla, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That beldam called and whispered in her ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So as that none beside could hear the two⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘A poison of quick power for me prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as, I know, thou knowest how to brew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bottle it; for I have found a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The traitorous son of Marganor to slay;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And me and thee no less can save,’ (she said,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘And this at better leisure will explain.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The woman went her ways, the potion made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the palace bent her steps again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A flask of Candian sweet wine she purveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith Drusilla sheathed that deadly bane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kept the beverage for the nuptial day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For now had ceased all hindrance and delay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On the fixt day she seeks the temple, dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With precious jewels and with goodly gear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where her lord’s tomb, befitting such a knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Built by her order, two fair pillars rear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy office there, with solemn rite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is sung, which men and women troop to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—gay, beyond his usage⁠—with his heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begirt by friends, Sir Marganor is there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When the holy obsequies at last were o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the priest was blest the poisoned draught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He into a fair golden cup did pour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wine, as by Drusilla had been taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She drank what sorted with her sex; nor more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than would effect the purpose which she sought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to the bridegroom, with a jocund eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Handed the draught, who drained the goblet dry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The cup returned⁠—Tanacro, blithe and gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opened his arms Drusilla to embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then altered was her sweet and winning way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to a tempest that long calm gave place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thrust him back, she motioned him away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seemed to kindle in her eyes and face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the youth, with broken voice and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘Traitor, stand off,’⁠—the furious lady said;⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Shalt thou then joy and solace have from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I tears from thee, and punishment and woe?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now these mine hands shall make an end of thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, if thou know’st it not, for poison know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much grieve I that thou should’st too honoured be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the executioner who deals the blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should’st die a death too easy: since I wot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thee too shameful hand or pain is not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘In seeing this thy death, it gives me pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My sacrifice should be completed ill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For could I do by thee as I were fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing should lack that purpose to fulfill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May my sweet consort not the work disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for the imperfect deed accept the will!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, without power to compass what I would,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have been fain to slay thee as I could!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And that deserved punishment, which I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot, as I desire, on thee bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hope thy soul shall have; hope to be nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see thee suffer, in the realms of woe.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her turbid eyes then raising to the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With joyous face all over in a glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(She cried) ‘Olindro, take this victim’s life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the good will of thine avenging wife;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And of our lord for me the grace obtain,</span>

				<span class="i1">If he reply, none cometh to your reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without desert; say such I bring with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who this fell impious monster, in his fane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Offer, as my first-fruits; and what can be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A greater merit than to have supprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such loathsome and abominable pest?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her life, together with her speech, was spent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, even dead, her face appeared to glow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With joy, at having dealt such punishment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him, that laid her cherished husband low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If fierce Tanacro’s spirit did prevent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of follow hers, I wiss not; but, I trow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prevented, for on him that venom rank</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet faster wrought, because he deeper drank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Marganor, who beheld his only son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fall and expire, his outstretched arms between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well nigh had with Tanacro died, o’erthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that so sudden grief and unforeseen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two sons he had, and now was left alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brought to that pass he by two wives had been;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> was the cause one spent his vital breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her own hand, that dealt the other death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Love, pity, sorrow, anger, and desire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of death and vengeance, all together rend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rack the childless and unhappy sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who groans like sea, when wind and waves contend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the dame, with vengeful thoughts afire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He goes, but sees that life is at an end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, goaded by his rage and hatred hot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeks to offend her corse that feels it not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As serpent, by the pointed spear pinned down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixes his teeth in it, with fruitless spire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or as the mastiff runs towards a stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which has been flung by some wayfaring wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gnaws it in his rage, nor will be gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he venge himself; ’tis so the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than any mastiff, any serpent, worse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Offends Drusilla’s cold and lifeless corse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, for he venteth not, nor slakes his mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By foul abuse upon the carcase done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the women, a large multitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He springs, and there shows mercy unto none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mown are we with his impious sword, as strewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is grass with scythe, when dried by summer sun.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is no ’scape; for straightways of our train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are full a hundred maimed, and thirty slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He of his vassals is so held in dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is no man who dares to lift his eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The women with the meaner sort are fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whosoever can, the temple flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His friends against the furious fit make head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last, with kind constraint and suppliant cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, leaving every thing in tears below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him in his castle on the rock bestow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His wrath enduring still, to send away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wretch determines all the female band:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, his will us utterly to slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His people and his friends, with prayer, withstand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he bids punish, on that very day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An order for us all to leave his land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Placed such his pleasures on these confines: woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To them that nearer to his castle go!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thus husbands from their wives divided are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mothers from sons: if hither to resort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Despite that order, any one should dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let none know this, who might the deed report!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For sorely mulcted for the transgression were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many, and many slain in cruel sort.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A statute for his town next made the peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fouler law we neither read nor hear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It wills, all women found within the vale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For thither even yet will some descend,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His men with rods shall on the shoulders whale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And into exile from those countries send;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first their gowns shall clip, and parts unveil</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That decency and natural shame offend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if with escort of an armed knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Any wend thither, they are slain outright.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Those that an armed warrior’s escort have,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By this ill man, to piety a foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are dragged as victims to his children’s grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where his own hand inflicts the murderous blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stript ignominiously of armour, glaive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And steed, their champions to his prisons go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this can he compel; for, night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand men the tyrant’s hest obey;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I will add, moreover, ’tis his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does he free any one, he first shall swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the holy wafer, that he still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To woman, while he lives, will hatred bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If then these ladies and yourself to spill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seem good to you, to yonder walls repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put to proof withal, if prowess more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or cruelty prevails in Marganor.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, in those maids of martial might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First she such pity moved and then disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they (had it been day instead of night)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would then have gone against that castellain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There rest the troop; and when Aurora’s light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Serves as a signal to the starry train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they should all before the sun recede,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They don the cuirass and remount the steed:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now, in act to go, that company</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind them hear the stony road resound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a long trample, when those warlike three</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Look down the vale and roll their eyes around;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they from thence, a stone’s-throw distant, see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A troop, which through a narrow pathway wound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A score they are perhaps in number, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On horseback, or on foot, their way pursue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They with them on a horse a woman haul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Whom stricken sore in years her visage shows,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In guise wherein some doleful criminal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned to gallows, fire, or prison goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, notwithstanding that wide interval,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is by her features known, as well as clothes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They of the village, mid the cavalcade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know her for fair Drusilla’s chamber maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The chamber wench, made prisoner with his prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the rapacious stripling, as I shewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who being trusted with that ill emprize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The poisoned draught of foul effect had brewed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the others she and those solemnites</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had kept away, suspecting what ensued:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, this while, from that lordship had she fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she in safety hoped to hide her head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>News being after to her foeman brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she retired in Ostericche lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, with intent to burn the woman, sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have her in his power by every way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finally unhappy Avarice, bought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By costly presents, and by proffered pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wrought on a lord, assured upon whose lands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beldam lived, to put her in his hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He on a sumpter horse the prisoner sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Constance-town, like merchandise addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fastened and bound in manner to prevent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The use of speech, and prisoned in a chest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whence that rabble, <em>his</em> ill instrument,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has all pity banished from his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had hither brought her, that his impious rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cruel man might on the hag assuage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the flood, swoln with Vesulo’s thick snows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The farther that it foams upon its way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with Ticino and Lambra, seaward goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ada, and other streams that tribute pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much more haughty and impetuous flows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero so, the more he hears display</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marganor’s guilt, and so that gentle pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of damsels filled with fiercer choler are.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Them with such hatred, them with such disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the wretch so many crimes incense,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they will punish him, despite the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or armed men arrayed in his defence:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But speedy death appears too kind a pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And insufficient for such foul offence.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better they deem, mid pangs prolonged and slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He all the bitterness of death should know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But first ’tis right that woman to unchain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She whom the hangman-crew to death escort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the quick rowel and the loosened rein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made the quick coursers make that labour short.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never had those assaulted to sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encounter of so fell and fierce a sort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who held it for a grace, with loss of shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harness and captive dame, to quit the field;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even as the wolf, who, laden with his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is homeward to his secret cavern bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when he deems that safest is the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholds it crost by hunter and by hound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flings down his load, and swiftly darts away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where most o’ergrown with brushwood is the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor quicker are that band to void the vale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than those bold three are quicker to assail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not only they the dame and martial gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But many horses they as well forsook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as the surest refuge in their fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast themselves down from bank and caverned nook:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which pleased the damsels and the youthful peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who three of those forsaken horses took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mount those three, whom, through the day before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon their croups the three good coursers bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence, lightened thus, their way they thither bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where that despiteous, shameful, lordship lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved the beldam in their band shall wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see Drusilla venged; in vain denies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That woman, who misdoubts the adventure’s end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grieves, and shrieks, and weeps in piteous wise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For flinging her upon Frontino’s croup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero bears her off amid the troop.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They reached a summit, and from thence espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A town with many houses, large and rich;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With nought to stop the way on any side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As neither compassed round by wall or ditch.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A rock was in the middle, fortified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a tall tower, upon its topmost pitch.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearlessly thither pricked the warriors, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marganor’s mansion in that fortress knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as in the town that cavalcade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, some footmen, who kept watch and ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind those warriors closed a barricade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While <em>that</em>, before, they found already barred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lo! Sir Marganor, with men arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some foot, some horsemen! armed was all the guard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to the strangers, in few words, but bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wicked custom of his lordship told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa, who had planned the thing whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Aymon’s daughter and the youthful knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For answer, spurred against the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, valiant as she was and full of might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not putting in the rest her puissant spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or baring that good sword, so famed in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So smote him with her fist upon the head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That on his horse’s neck he fell half dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The maid of France is with Marphisa gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in the rear it seen Rogero’s crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with those two his course so bravely run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, though his lance he raised not from the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six men he slew; transfixed the paunch of one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another’s head, of four the neck or breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the sixth he broke it, whom in flight he speared:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It pierced his spine and at his paps appeared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As many as are touched, so many lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth, by Bradamant’s gold lance o’erthrown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seems a bolt, dismist form burning sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, in its fury, shivers and beats down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever it encounters, far and nigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some fly to plain, or castle from the town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others to sheltering church and house repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And none, save dead, are seen in street or square.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the hands of Marganor, behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His back, the fierce Marphisa had made fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to Drusilla’s maid the wretch consigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well pleased that such a care on her was cast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To burn the town ’twas afterwards designed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save it repented of its errors past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repealed the statute Marganor had made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a new law, imposed by her, obeyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such end to compass is no hard assay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, besides fearing lest Marphisa yearn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To execute more vengeance⁠—lest she say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“She one and all will slaughter and will burn,”⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The townsmen all were advised to the sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cruel statute of that tyrant stern;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But did, as others mostly do, that best</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obey the master whom they most detest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since none dares trust another, nor his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Out of suspicion⁠—to his comrades break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They let him banish one, another kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From <em>this</em> his substance, <em>that</em> his honour take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the heart cries to Heaven, that here is still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till God and saints at length to vengeance wake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, albeit they due punishment suspend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By mighty pain the long delay amend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The rabble, full of rage and enmity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now seeks the wretch with word and deed to grieve</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As, it is said, all strip the fallen tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from its roots and wintry winds upheave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let rulers in his sad example see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill doers in the end shall ill receive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To view fell Marganor’s disastrous fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fit penance for his sins, pleased great and small.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Many, of whom the sister had been slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mother, or the daughter, or the wife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeking no more their rebel wrath to rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurry, with their own hands to take his life;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And young Rogero and the damsels twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can scarce defend the felon in that strife;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom those illustrious three had doomed to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid trouble, fear, and lengthened agony.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the hag, who bore such hatred to that wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As woman to an enemy can bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They give their prisoner naked, bound so tight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will not at one shake the cordage tear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, her pains and sorrow to requite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crimsons the wretch’s body, here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a sharp goad, which, mid that village band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A peasant churl had put into her hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor she the courier-maid, nor they that ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her, aye mindful how they had been shent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now let their hands hang idle by their side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less than that old crone on vengeance bent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such was their fierce desire, it nullified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The power to harm; but rage must have its vent.,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him one with stones, another with her nails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> with her teeth, with needles <em>that</em>, assails.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As torrent one while foams in haughty tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When fed with mighty rain or melted snow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, rending form the mountain’s rugged side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tree, rock, and crop and field, the waters go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then comes a season when its crested pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is vanished, and its vigour wasted so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A child, a woman, everywhere may tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And often dry-shod cross, its rugged bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So Marganor whilere each bound and bourn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made tremble, whereso’er his name was heard:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now one is come to bruise the tyrant’s horn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now his prowess is so little feared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That even the little children work him scorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some pluck his hair and others pluck his beard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence young Rogero and the damsels twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards his rock-built castle turn the rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This without contest its possessors yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the rich goods preserved in that repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These the friends partly spoiled, and partly dealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Ulany and that attendant pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With them, recovered was the golden shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those three monarchs that were prisoned there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, without arms, afoot, towards that hold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had wended, as meseems whilere was told.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For from the day that they were overthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Bradamant, afoot, they evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unarmed, in company with her had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hither came from her so distant shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not, I, if it was better done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or worse, by her, that they their arms forbore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worse, touching her defence; but better far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If they were losers in the doubtful war.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For she would have been dragged⁠—like others, whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed men had thither brought beneath their guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Unhappy women) to the brothers’ tomb⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the sacrifice knife have died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Death, sure, is worse, and more disastrous doom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than showing that which modesty would hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they who can to force ascribe the blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguish this and every other shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Before they hence depart, the martial twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assemble the inhabitants, to swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“They to their wives the rule of that domain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will leave, as well as every other care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that they will chastise, with heavy pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whoever to oppose this law shall dare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—In fine, man’s privileges, whatsoe’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They swear, shall be conferred on woman here:”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then make them promise, “never to bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harbourage on whosoever thither sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Footman or cavalier, nor even allow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Any beneath a roof to hide his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless he swore by God and saints, or vow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet stronger made⁠—if stronger could be said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he the sex’s cause would aye defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foe to their foes, and woman’s faithful friend;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, if he then were wived, or ever were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Sooner or later⁠—linked in nuptial noose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still to his wife he would allegiance bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor e’er compliance with her will refuse.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa says, “within the year, she there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will be, and ere the trees their foliage lose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, save she find her statute in effect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That borough fire and ruin may expect.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor hence they part ill from the filthy place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein it lay, Drusilla’s corse is borne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her with her lord they in a tomb encase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with what means the town supplies, adorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drusilla’s ancient woman, in this space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marganor’s body with her goad has torn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who only grieves she has not wind enow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No respite to his torture to allow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beside a church, the martial damsels twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold a pillar, standing in the square;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereon the wicked lord of the domain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had graved that mad and cruel law; the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In imitation, his helm, plate, and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shield, in guise of trophy fasten there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards upon the pillar trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That law they had enacted for the place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within the town the troop set up their rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the law is graved, of different frame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that before upon the stone imprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which every woman doom’d to death and shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the intention to replace her vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here from that band divides the Islandick dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who deems, at court ’twere shameful to appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless adorned and mantled as whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here Ulany remained, and in her power</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remained the wicked tyrant Marganor:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, lest he any how, in evil hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should break his bonds and injure damsel more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made him, one day, leap headlong from a tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who never took so still a leap before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more of her and hers! I of the crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That journey toward Arles, the tale pursue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Throughout all <em>that</em> and the succeeding day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the forenoon, proceed those banded friends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, where the main-road branches, and one way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the camp, to Arles the other tends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again embrace the lovers, and oft say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A last farewell, which evermore offends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsels seek the camp; to Arles is gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero; and my canto I have done.</span>

				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>To Arles the Child, to Charles Marphisa wends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be baptised, with Bradamant for guide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Astolpho from the holy realm descends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through whom with sight the Nubian is supplied:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Agramant’s land he with his troop offends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he is of his Afric realm so wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Charles he bargains, that, on either side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two knights by strife their quarrel should decide.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Ye courteous ladies, who unto my strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kind audience lend⁠—I read it in your cheer⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That good Rogero should depart again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So suddenly, from her that held him dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Displeases ye, and scarce inflicts less pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that which Bradamant endured whilere:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I read you also argue, to his shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That feebly burned in him the amorous flame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If from her side for other cause had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against that lady’s will, the youthful lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though in the hope more treasure to have won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than swelled rich Croesus’ or rich Crassus’ hoard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I too should deem the dart, by Cupid thrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not the heart-core of Rogero gored.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such a sovereign joy, a prize so high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No silver and no gold could ever buy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet to preserve our honour not alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserves excuse, it also merits praise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This to preserve, I say, when to have done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other wise, might shame and scandal raise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had fair Bradamant reluctance shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And obstinately interposed delays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, as a certain sign, had served to prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lady’s little wit or little love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For if <em>his</em> life, whom gentle woman loves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As her own life she values, or before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I speak of one at whom young Cupid roves<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-458" id="noteref-458" epub:type="noteref">458</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With arrows which beneath the mantle gore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His honour to his pleasure it behoves</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That woman to prefer, by so much more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As man beyond his life his honour treasures,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed by him above all other pleasures.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His duty good Rogero satisfied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Following the royal lord with whom he came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For having no fair cause to quit his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not leave the Paynim without shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if his sire had by Almontes died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this, King Agramant was not to blame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for his parents’ every past offence</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had made Rogero mighty recompense.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He will perform his duty to repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his liege lord; so did that martial maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had not with reiterated prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As so she might have done) Rogero stayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling may appay the warlike fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other season, if not now appaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But twice two hundred years will not atone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crying sin of honour once foregone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Arles-town, whither had his king conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His remnant of a host, he pricked anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While they that, since their kindred was displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had a close friendship formed⁠—the damsels two⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither together go where Charles had made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His mightiest effort, with the Christian crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping by siege or fight to break the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And free his kingdom form so long a woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant, when she in the camp appeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was greeted with a welcome warm and kind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On all sides was she hailed, by all was cheered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she in this or that her head inclined.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, when he of her coming heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Met her; nor young Richardo stayed behind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Richardet; nor others of her race;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all received the maid with joyful face.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When next ’tis known, the second of the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is that Marphisa, so in arms renowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from Catày unto the bounds of Spain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had journeyed, with a thousand laurels crowned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor rich nor poor within their tents remain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The curious crowd, encompassing them round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Press, harm, and heave each other here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the sole wish to see so bright a pair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By them was Charles saluted reverently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the first day was this (has Turpin shown)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa had been seen to bend her knee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Pepin’s royal son to her, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserving of such duty seemed to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid emperors or kings that filled a throne,</span>

				<span>Her kindly Charlemagne received, and wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the pavilions met, in open view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, above king, and prince, and peer, beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself the monarch placed that damsel true.</span>

				<span class="i1">Who go not, are dismist; so none abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In little time, except the good and few.</span>

				<span>Marphisa first began in grateful strain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Unconquered Caesar, glorious and august,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, to Alcides’ strait from Indian main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mak’st Scythian’s pale and Aethiop’s race adust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Revere thy Christian cross of snowy grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Of earthly monarchs thou most sage and just⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hither thy glory, which no limits bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has brought me from the world’s extremest ground;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And (to avow the truth) in jealous mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone I came, alone with thee to fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because I grudged that king so puissant shou’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exist on earth, save he observed my rite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence reek they ravaged fields with Christian blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet with greater rancour and despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like cruel foe, I purposed to offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that it chanced, one changed me to a friend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When to worst harm and scaith thy bands I doom,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I find (as at my leisure I will show)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero of Risa was my father, whom</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An evil brother traitorously laid low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me my sad mother carried in her womb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond the sea, and bore in want and woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till my seventh year by wizard nourished, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was stolen from him by thieves of Araby.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“They to a king in Persia vended me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That after died beneath my faulchion, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fain have taken my virginity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When grown, that king and all his court I slew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chased his ill race, and seized his royalty;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—such my fortune⁠—by a month or two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I eithteen years had not o’erpast, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I added to my realm six kingdoms more;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, moved by envy of thy glorious fame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I in my heart resolved (as thou hast heard)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To abate the grandeur of they mighty name:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I haply so had done; I haply erred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now a chance has served <em>that</em> will to tame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clip my fury’s wings; the having heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I arrived in Christendom, how we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are bound by ties of consanguinity;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, for my father thee, as kinsman, served,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So thou a kin and servant hast in me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I that envy, that fierce hate, which nerved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mine arm whilere, now blot from memory.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, these for evil Agramant reserved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for his sire’s and uncle’s kin shall be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They who were whilom guilty of the death</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that unhappy pair, who gave me breath.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She adds, “the Christian faith she will receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, after having spent king Agramant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will home return, with royal Charles’s leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her kingdom to baptise in the Levant,</span>

				<span class="i1">Shall be the Christian faith’s and empire’s gain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charles, no less eloquent upon his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than bold in deed and prudent in design,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much that illustrious lady magnified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And much her father, much her noble line:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He courteously to every point replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of his heart his open front was sign.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As his last words, “that he received the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As kinswoman and child,” the monarch said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then rose and locked her in a new embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kissed her, like a daughter, on the brow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Morgana and Clermont’s kin, with joyful face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All thither troop; ’twere tedious to tell how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo did the gentle damsel grace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he had oftentimes espied ere now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her martial prowess, tried by goodly test,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they with girding siege Albracca pressed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twere long to tell how, with those worthies met,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guido rejoiced to see Marphisa there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gryphon and Aquilant, and Sansonet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with her in the cruel city were;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-459" id="noteref-459" epub:type="noteref">459</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vivian, and Malagigi, and Richardet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when Maganza’s traitors made repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With those ill purchasers of Spain to trade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found such a faithful comrade in the maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They deck the ground for the ensuing day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Charlemagne takes care himself to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they the place shall sumptuously array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein Marphisa’s baptism is to be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bishops are gathered, learned clerks, and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who ken the laws of Christianity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That taught in all its doctrine by their care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And holy skill may be that martial fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In sacred stole, pontifical, arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her the archbishop Turpin did baptise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charlemagne from the healthful font the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplifted with befitting ceremonies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But it is time the witless head to aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that, which treasured in the phial lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith Astolpho, from the lowest star,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-460" id="noteref-460" epub:type="noteref">460</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descended in Elias’ fiery car.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke descended from the lucid round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this our earthly planet’s loftiest height.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wither he with that blessed vase was bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which was the mighty champion’s brain to right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A herb of sovereign virtue on that ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The apostle shows, and with it bids the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Nubian’s eyeballs touch, when him anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He visits, and restore that sovereign’s view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That he, for this and for his first desert,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May give him bands, Biserta to assail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shows him how that people inexpert</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He may to battle train, in plate and mail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how to pass the deserts, without hurt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where men are dazzled by the sandy gale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The order that throughout should be maintained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From point to point, the sainted sire explained;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then made him that plumed beast again bestride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s and Atlantes’ steed whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By sainted John dismist, his reverend guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those holy regions left the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And coasting Nile, on one or the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw Nubia’s realm before him soon appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, in its chief city, to the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descended, and anew Senapus found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Great was the joy, and great was the delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith that king received the English lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who well remembered how the gentle knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had from the loathsome harpies freed his board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the humour, that obscured his sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Valiant Astolpho scaled, and now restored</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the blind sovereign’s eyesight as before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would that warrior as a god adore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So that not only those whom he demands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the Bisertine war, he gives in aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But adds a hundred thousand from his bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And offer of his royal person made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce on the open plain embattled stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—All foot⁠—the Nubian host, for war arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For few the horses which that region bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of elephants and camels a large store.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The night before the day, when on its road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Nubian force should march, Astolpho rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his winged hippogryph again bestrode:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, hurrying ever south, in fury goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a high hill, the southern wind’s abode;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence he towards the Bears in fury blows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There finds a cave, through whose strait entrance breaks</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fell and furious Auster, when he wakes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, as his master erst instruction gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him an empty bladder had conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, at the vent of that dim Alpine cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein reposed the wearied wind, was laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quaintly and softly by the baron brave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so unlooked for was the ambuscade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, issuing forth at morn, to sweep the plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Auster imprisoned in the skin remains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Nubia he, rejoicing in his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returns; and with that very light the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the black host, sets out upon his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lets the victual follow in his rear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Mount Atlas with his whole array</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In safety goes the glorious cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through shifting plains of powdery sand he past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor dreaded danger from the sultry blast;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And having gained the mountain’s hither side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence are discerned the plain, and distant brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He chooses from the swarm he has to guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The noblest and most fit for discipline;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes them, here and there, in troops divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At a hill’s foot, wherewith the plains confine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then leaves his host and climbs the hill’s ascent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one that is on lofty thoughts intent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After he, lowly kneeling in the dust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His holy master had implored, in true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assurance he was heard, he downward thrust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A heap of stones. O what things may he do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the Saviour wholly puts his trust!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stones beyond the use of nature grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which rolling to the sandy plain below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, neck and muzzle, legs and belly show.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They, neighing shrill, down narrow paths repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lusty leaps; and lighting on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplift the croup, like coursers as they are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some bay, some roan, and some of dapple stain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The crowds that waiting in the valleys were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Layed hands on them, and seized them by the rein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus in a thought each soldier had his horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Born ready reined and saddled for the course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He fourscore thousand of his Nubian power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One hundred and two footmen, in a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To horsemen changes, who wide Afric scour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, upon every side, sack, burn, and slay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant had intrusted town and tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till his return, to king Branzardo’s sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Fersa’s king, and him of the Algaziers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these against Astolpho lead their spears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Erewhile a nimble bark, with sail and oar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They had dispatched, which, stirring feet and wings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">News of the Nubian monarch’s outrage bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Agramant from his vicegerent kings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That rests not, night nor day, till to the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Provence she her doleful tiding brings;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finds her monarch half subdued in Arles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For camped within a mile was conquering Charles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant, hearing in what peril lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His realm, through his attack on Pepin’s reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him in this pressing peril to advise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calls kings and princes of the paynim train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when he once or twice has turned his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On sage Sobrino and the king of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Eldest and wisest they those lords among⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarch so bespeaks the assembled throng:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Albeit if fits not captain, as I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To say, ‘on this I thought not,’ this I say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because when from a quarter comes the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From every human forethought far away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis for such fault a fair excuse, I trow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here all hinges; I did ill to lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfurnished Afric open to attack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If there was ground to fear the Nubian sack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But who could think, save only God on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prescient of all which is to be below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, from a land beneath such distant sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such mighty host would come, to work us woe?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt whom and us unstable deserts lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those shifting sands, which restless whirlwinds blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet they their camp have round Biserta placed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And laid the better part of Afric waste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I now on this, O peers! your counsel crave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If, bootless, homeward I should wend my way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or should not such a fair adventure wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till Charles with me a prisoner I convey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or how I may as well our Afric save,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ruin this redoubted empire, say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who can advise, is prayed his lore to shew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That we may learn the best, and that pursue.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said; and on Marsilius seated nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next turned his eyes, who in the signal read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it belonged to him to make reply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To what the king of Africa had said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Spaniard rose, and bending reverently</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Agramant the knee as well as head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again his honoured seat in council prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in these words the Moorish king addrest:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My liege, does Rumour good or ill report,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It still increases them; hence shall I ne’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under despondence, lack for due support,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor bolder course than is befitting steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For what may chance, of good or evil sort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weighing in even balance hope and fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’errated still; and which we should not mete</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By what I hear so many tongues repeat;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Which should so much more doubtfully be viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it seems less with likelihood to stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now it is seen, if there be likelihood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That king who reigns in so remote a land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed by such a mighty multitude,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should set his foot on warlike Afric’s strand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Traversing sands, to which in evil hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cambyses trusted his ill-omened power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I well believe, that from some neighbouring hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Arabs have poured down, to waste the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, for the country was defended ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have taken, burnt, destroyed and sacked and slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that Branzardo, who your place doth fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As viceroy and lieutenant of the reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has set down thousands, where he tens should write;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The better to excuse him in your sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The Nubian squadrons, I will even yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have been rained down on Afric from the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or haply they have come, in clouds concealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that their march was hidden from all eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Think you, because unaided in the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your Afric from such host in peril lies?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your garrisons were sure of coward vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If they were scared by such a craven train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But will you send some frigates, albeit few,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Provided that unfurled your standards be)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sooner shall they loose from hence, that crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of spoilers shall within their confines flee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nubians are they, or idle Arabs⁠—who,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowing that you are severed by the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From your own realm, and warring with our band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have taken courage to assail your land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now take your time for vengeance, when the son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Pepin is without his nephew’s aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since bold Orlando is away, by none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the hostile sect resistance can be made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If, through neglect or blindness, be foregone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The glorious Fortune, which for you has stayed,</span>

				<span class="i1">She her bald front, as now her hair, will show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To our long infamy and mighty woe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus warily the Spanish king replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proving by this and other argument,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish squadrons should in France abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till Charlemagne was into exile sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But King Sobrino, he that plainly spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The scope whereon Marsilius was intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To public good preferring private gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So spake in answer to the king of Spain:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My liege, when I to peace exhorted you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would that my prophecy had proved less just!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of, if I was to prove a prophet true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye in Sobrino had reposed more trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in King Rodomont and in that crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alzirdo, Martasine and Marbalust!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom I would here see gladly, front to front;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But see most gladly boastful Rodomont.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To twit that warrior with his threat, ‘to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By France, what by the brittle glass is done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And throughout heaven and hell your course pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, (as the monarch said) your course outrun.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet lapt in foul and loathsome ease, while you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So need his help, lies Ulien’s lazy son;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-461" id="noteref-461" epub:type="noteref">461</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I, that as a coward was decried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For my true prophecy, am at your side,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And ever will be while this life I bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, albeit ’tis with yours sore laden, still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Daily for you is risked with them that are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The best of France; and⁠—be he who he will⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is not mortal living who will dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To say Sobrino’s deeds were ever ill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, many who vaunt more, amid your host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have not so much, nay lighter, cause for boast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I speak, these words to show that what whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I said and say again, has neither sprung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From evil heart, nor is the fruit of fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that true love and duty move my tongue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You homeward with what haste you may to steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I counsel, your assembled bands among;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For little is the wisdom of that wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who risks his own to gain another’s right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If there be gain, ye know, Late thirty-two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your vassal kings, with you our sails we spread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, if we pause to sum the account anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hardly a third survives; the rest are dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May it please Heaven no further loss ensue!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if you will pursue your quest, I dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest not a fourth nor fifth will soon remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wholly spent will be your wretched train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Orlando’s absence so far aids, that where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our troops are few, there haply <em>none</em> would be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not through this removed our perils are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though it prolongs our evil destiny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold Rinaldo! whom his deeds declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less than bold Orlando; of his tree</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There are the shoots; with paladin and peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our baffled Saracens’ eternal fear;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And the other Mars (albeit against my heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It goes to waste my praise upon a foe);</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I speak of the redoubted Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose feats no less than fierce Orlando’s show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose mighty prowess I have proved in part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In part, at others’ cost I see and know.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then many days Orlando has been gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet we have lost more fields than we have won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fear, if heretofore our band has lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A heavier forfeit will henceforth be paid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blotted is Mandricardo from our host;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martial Gradasso hath withdrawn his aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, at our worst, has left her post;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Argier’s lord; of whom it may be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he as true as strong, we should not need</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso and the Tartar king, to speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“While aids like these are lost to our array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While on our side such slaughtered thousands lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those looked-for are arrived, nor on her way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is any vessel fraught with new supply⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles has been joined by four, that, as they say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might with Orlando or Rinaldo vie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With reasons, for from hence to Bactrian shore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-462" id="noteref-462" epub:type="noteref">462</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill would you hope to find such other four.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I know not if you know who Guido are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet, and the sons of Olivier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For these I more respect, more fear I bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than any warlike duke or cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Almàyn’s or of other lineage fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for the Roman empire rests the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I misrate not those of newer stamp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, to our scathe, are gathered in their camp.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As often as ye issue on the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worsted so oft, or broken, shall you be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If oft united Africa and Spain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were losers, when sixteen to eight were we,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What will ensue, when banded with Almàyn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are England, Scotland, France, and Italy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When with our six twice six their weapons cross,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What else can we expect but shame and loss?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You lose your people <em>here</em>, and <em>there</em> your reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you in this emprise are obstinate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Returning⁠—us, the remnant of your train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You save, together with your royal state.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It were ill done to leave the king of Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since all for this would hold you sore ingrate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet there’s a remedy in peace; which, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It pleases but yourself, will please the foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But, if, as first defeated, on your part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems a shame to offer peace, and ye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have war and wasteful battle more at heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waged hitherto with what success you see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least to gain the victory use art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which may be yours, if you are ruled by me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay all our quarrel’s trial on one peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let Rogero be that cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Such our Rogero is, ye know and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That⁠—pitted one to one in listed fight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not Roland, not Rinaldo stands more high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor whatsoever other Christian knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would ye kindle warfare far and nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though superhuman be that champion’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior is but one mid many spears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Matched singly with a host of martial peers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Meseemeth, if to you it seemeth good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye should propose to Charles the war to end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, to spare the constant waste of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which his, and countless of your warriors spend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He⁠—by a knight of yours to be withstood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A champion, chosen from his best should send;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those two all the warfare wage alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till one prevails, and one is overthrown;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“On pact the king, whose champion in the just</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is loser, tribute to that other pay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will this pact displease King Charles, I trust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though <em>his</em> was the advantage in the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then of his arms Rogero so robust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem, that he will surely win the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would prevail (so certain is our right)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though Mars himself should be his opposite.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With these and other sayings yet more sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wrought Sobrino, he his end obtained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on that day interpreters were found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they that day to Charles their charge explained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles, whom such matchless cavaliers surround.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believes the battle is already gained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chooses good Rinaldo for the just,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next to Orlando in his sovereign’s trust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In this accord like cause for pleasure find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well the Christian as the paynim foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, harassed sore in body and in mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those warriors all were weary, all were woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each in repose and quietude designed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pass what time remained to him below:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each cursed the senseless anger and the hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which stirred their hearts to discord and debate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo felt himself much magnified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Charles, for what in him so strong weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More trusted him than all his court beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And glad the honoured enterprise assayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero he esteemed not in his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thought he ill could keep him from his blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor deemed the Child could equal him in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit he slew in strife the Tartar knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, though much honoured, on his part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That him his king has chosen from the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom a trust so weighty to impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As of his many martial lords the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet shows a troubled face; not that the heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that good knight unworthy fears molest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only none Rinaldo would have bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, with Orlando leagued, he would not dread⁠—</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But because sister of the Christian knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He knows) is she, his consort true and dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That to the stripling evermore did write,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one sore injured by that cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, if to ancient sins he should unite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mortal combat with Montalban’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, although loving, will he anger so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not lightly she her hatred will forego.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If silently Rogero made lament</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he in his despite must battle do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sobs his consort dear to hers gave vent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When shortly to her ears the tidings flew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She beat her breast, her golden tresses rent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast, scalding tears her innocent cheeks bedew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She taxes young Rogero as ingrate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And aye cries out upon her cruel fate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nought can result to Bradamant but pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever is the doubtful combat’s end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She will not think Rogero can be slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, ’twould seem, her very heart would rend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And should our Lord the fall of France ordain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> kingdom for more sins than one to amend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle maid, beside a brother’s loss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have to weep a worse and bitterer cross.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For, without shame and scorn, she never may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not without hatred of her kin combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her loved lord return in such a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that it may be known of all mankind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As, thinking upon this by night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She oftentimes had purposed in her mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so by promise both were tied withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Room for repentance and retreat was small.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But she, that ever, when things adverse were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With faithful succour Bradamant had stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say the weird Melissa, could not bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear the wailings of the woeful maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She hurried to console her in her care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And proffered succour in due time and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“She would disturb that duel ’twixt the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The occasion of such grief and cruel pain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile their weapons for the future fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero and Duke Aymon’s son prepared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The choice whereof with that good warrior lay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-463" id="noteref-463" epub:type="noteref">463</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Roman empire’s knight by Charles declared;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, like one that ever from the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He lost his goodly steed afoot had fared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made choice, afoot and fenced with plate and mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foe with axe and dagger to assail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether Chance moved Mountalban’s martial lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Malagigi, provident and sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That knew how young Rogero’s charmed sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleft helm and hauberk in its greedy rage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One and the other warrior made accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As said) without their faulchions to engage.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The place of combat chosen by that twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was near old Arles, upon a spacious plain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Watchful Aurora hardly from the bower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of old Tithonus hath put forth her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give beginning to the day and hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prefixed and ordered for that duel dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When deputies from either hostile power,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On this side and on that forth issuing, spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tents at each entrance of the lists; and near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The two pavillions, both, an altar rear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After short pause, was seen upon the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim host in different squadrons dight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rich in barbarick pomp, amid that train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rode Afric’s monarch, ready armed for fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bay was the steed he backed, with sable mane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two of his legs were pied, his forehead white.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast beside Agramant, Rogero came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him to serve Marsilius thought no shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The casque that he from Mandricardo wrung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In single combat with such travel sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The casque that (as in loftier strain is sung)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cased Hector’s head, a thousand years before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marsilius carried, by his side, among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Princes and lords, that severally bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other harness of Rogero bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enriched with precious pearls and rough with gold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the other part, without his camp appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles, with his men at arms in squadrons dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in such order led his cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they would keep, if marshalled for the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fenced is the monarch with his famous peers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with him wends, all armed, Montalban’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed, save his helmet, erst Mambrino’s casque;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To carry which is Danish Ogier’s task;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, of two axes, hath Duke Namus one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Salamon the other: Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is to <em>this</em> side, with all his following, gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To <em>that</em> wend those of Afric and of Spain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the mid space between the hosts is none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Empty remains large portion of the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he is doomed to death who thither goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By joint proclaim, except the chosen foes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the second choice of arms was made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him, the champion of the paynim clan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither two priests of either sect conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two books; <em>that</em>, carried by one holy man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Him of our law⁠—Christ’s perfect life displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those others’ volume was their Alcoran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The emperor in his hands the Gospel took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king of Africa that other book.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charlemagne, at his altar, to the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifted his hands, “O God, that for our sake”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Exclaimed the monarch) “wast content to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thyself a ransom for our sins to make;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—O thou that found such favour in his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That God from thee the flesh of man did take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne for nine months within thy holy womb,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While aye thy virgin flower preserved its bloom,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Hear, and be witnesses of what I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For me and those that after me shall reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Agramant and those that heir his sway,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I twenty loads of gold of perfect grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will every year deliver, if to-day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My champion vanquished in the lists remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vow I will straightway from warfare cease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from henceforth maintain perpetual peace;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And may your joint and fearful wrath descend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On me forthwith, if I my word forego!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And may it me and mine alone offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And none beside, amid this numerous show!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all in briefest time may comprehend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My breach of promise has brought down the woe.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So saying, in his hand the holy book</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles held, and fixed on heaven his earnest look.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This done, they seek that altar, sumptuously</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Decked for the purpose, by the pagan train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where their king swears, “that he will pass the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all his army, to his Moorish reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to King Charles will tributary be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If vanquished, young Rogero shall remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will observe the truce for evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the pact declared by Charles before;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And like him, nor in under tone, he swears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calling on Mahound to attest his oath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the volume which his pontiff bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To observe what he has promised plights his troth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to his side each hastily repairs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mid their several powers are harboured both.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next these, to swear arrive the champions twain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this the promise which their oaths contain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero pledges first his knightly word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Should <em>his</em> king mar, or send to mar, the fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He him no more as leader or as lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will serve, but wholly Charlemagne obey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Rinaldo⁠—“if in breach of their accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from the field King Charles would bear away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till one or the other is subdued in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he will be the Moorish monarch’s knight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When ended are the ceremonies, here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, to seek their camps the two divide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor long, therein delayed; when trumpets clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The time for their encounter signified:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to the charge advanced each cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Measuring with cautious care his every stride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! the assault begins; now low, now high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That pair the sounding steel in circles ply.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now with the axe’s blade, now with its heel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-464" id="noteref-464" epub:type="noteref">464</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their strokes they at the head or foot address;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these so skilfully and nimbly deal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As needs must shock all credence to express.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child, that at <em>her</em> brother aims the steel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who doth his miserable soul possess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evermore with such caution strikes his blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he is deemed less vigorous than his foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rather to parry then to smite intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He know not what to wish; that low should lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, would Rogero ill content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor willingly the Child by him would die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But here I am at my full line’s extent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where I must needs defer my history.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other canto shall the rest appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you that other canto please to hear.</span>

				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>Agramant breaks the pact, is overthrown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forced fair France for Afric to forego.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meanwhile Astolpho in Biserta’s town</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having with numerous host besieged the foe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By hazard there arrives bold Milo’s son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom the duke, instructed how to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Restores his wits. At sea does Dudon meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">King Agramant, and sore annoys his fleet.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Than that fell woe which on Rogero weighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Harder and bitterer pain forsooth is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which upon flesh and more on spirit preys:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For of two deaths there is no scaping one.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, if in strife o’erlaid, Rinaldo slays,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant, if Rinaldo is outdone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if he killed her brother, well he knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hate, than death more hateful, would ensue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo, unimpeded by such thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strove in all ways Rogero to o’erthrow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fierce and despiteous whirled his axe, and sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now in the arms, now head, to wound the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero circled here and there, and caught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his weapon’s shaft the coming blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if ever smote, aye strove to smite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he should injure least Montalban’s knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To most of them that led the paynim bands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But too unequal seemed the fierce assay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too slowly young Rogero plied his hands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too well Rinaldo kept the Child at bay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With troubled face the king of Afric stands:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sighed, and breathless gazed upon the fray;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the blame of that ill counsel flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On King Sobrino’s head, from whom it sprung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the weird Melissa, she⁠—the font</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all that wizards or enchanters know⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had by her art transformed her female front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And taken Argier’s mighty shape; in show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gesture she appeared as Rodomont,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seemed, like him, in dragon’s hide to go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such was her belted sword and such her shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor aught was wanting which he wore afield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She towards Troyano’s mournful son did guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In form of courser, a familiar sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with a troubled visage loudly cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“My liege, this is too foul an oversight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stripling boy in peril yet untried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against a Gaul, so stout and famed in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your champion in so fierce a strife to make;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Afric’s realm and honour are at stake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Let not this battle be pursued, my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that ’twould cost our Moorish cause too dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let sin of broken faith and forfeit word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fall upon Rodomont! take thou no fear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let each now show the metal of his sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each for a hundred stands when I am here.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So upon Agramant this counsel wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> king pressed forward without further thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, thinking that the monarch of Algiers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is with him, of the pact has little care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would not rate a thousand cavaliers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So high, if handed in his aid they were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence steeds reined-in and spurred, hence levelled spears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are seen in one short instant here and there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa, when the hosts are mixed in fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By her false phantoms, vanishes from sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The champions two, that, against all accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against all faith, disturbed their duel see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer strive in fight, but pledge their word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Yea, put aside all hostile injury⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they, on neither part, will draw the sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until they better certified shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who broke the pact, established by that twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young Agramant, or aged Charlemagne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They sweat anew, “the king who had o’erthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That truce, and broken faith, as foe to treat.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field of combat is turned upside down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some hurry to the charge, and some retreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who most deserved disgrace, who most renown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was seen, on both hands, in the selfsame feat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All ran alike: but, ’mid that wild affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These ran to meet the foe, those ran away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As greyhound in the slip, that the fleet hare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scowering about and circling him discerns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor with the other dogs a part can bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For him the hunter holds), with anger burns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Torments himself and mourns in his despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whines, and strives against the leash, by turns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such till that moment had the fury been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Aymon’s daughter and the martial queen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They till that hour upon the spacious plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had watched so rich a prize throughout the day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as obliged by treaty to refrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From laying hands upon the costly prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had sore lamented and had grieved in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gazing with longing eyes on that array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now seeing truce and treaty broke, among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moorish squadrons they rejoicing sprung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa piercing her first victim’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Two yards beyond his back the lance did pass)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In briefer time than ’tis by me exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broke with her sword four helms which flew like glass;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less did Bradamant upon the rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But them her spear reduced to other pass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All touched by that gold lance she overthrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doubling Marphisa’s score; yet none she slew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They witness to each others’ exploits are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Those maids to one another are so near)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, whither fury drives, the martial pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dividing, through the Moorish ranks career.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who could each several warrior’s name declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stretched on the champaign by that golden spear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or reckon every head Marphisa left</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divided by her horrid sword, or cleft?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As when benigner winds more swiftly blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Apennine his shaggy back lays bare,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-465" id="noteref-465" epub:type="noteref">465</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two turbid torrents with like fury flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, in their fall, two separate channels wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uproot hard rocks, and mighty trees which grow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On their steep banks, and field and harvest bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the vale, and seem as if they vied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which should do mightiest damage on its side:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So those high-minded virgin warriors two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scowering the field in separate courses, made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Huge havock of the Moors; whom they pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One with couched lance, and one with lifted blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hardly King Agramant his Afric crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From flight, beneath his royal banners stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In search of Rodomont, he vainly turned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor tidings of the missing warrior learned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He at his exhortation (so he trowed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had broke the treaty made in solemn wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To witness which the gods were called aloud;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who then so quick vanished from his eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sees he King Sobrino; disavowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By King Sobrino is the deed, who flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Arles, and deems that day some vengeance dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will fall on Agramant’s devoted head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marsilius too is fled into the town:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So has that monarch holy faith at heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis hence, that feebly King Troyano’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resists the crew, that war on Charles’s part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Italians, English, Germans; of renown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are all; and, scattered upon every part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are mixed the paladins, those barons bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glittering like jewels on a cloth of gold;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, with those peers, is more than one confest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As perfect as is earthly cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guide the savage, that intrepid breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those two famous sons of Olivier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will not now repeat what I exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that fierce, daring female twain whilere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on the field so many Moors extend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No number is there to the slain or end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, putting this affray some while aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a pinnace will I pass the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To them of France so fast I am not tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that Astolpho should remembered be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the grace given him by his holy guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I told erewhile, and told (it seems to me)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Branzardo and the king of Algaziers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the duke had mustered all their spears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such as the monarchs could in haste engage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raked from all Africa, that host contained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether of fitting or of feeble age;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce from impressing women they refrained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved his thirst of vengeance to assuage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant twice his Africa had drained.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-466" id="noteref-466" epub:type="noteref">466</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few people in the land were left, and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A feeble and dispirited array.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So proved they; for the foe was scarce in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before that levy broke in panic dread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like sheep, their quailing bands Astolpho slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charging at his more martial squadrons’ head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the slain filled all that champaign; few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into Biserta from the carnage fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A prisoner valiant Bucifar remained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The town in safety King Branzardo gained;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>More grieved as Bucifaro’s loss alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than had he lost the rest in arms arrayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wide and in want of ramparts is the town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these could ill be raised without his aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While fain to ransom him, he thinks upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The means, and stands afflicted and dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He recollects him how the paladin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dudon, has many a month his prisoner been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him under Monaco, upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his first passage, Sarza’s monarch took.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thenceforth had been a prisoner evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dudon, who was derived of Danish stock.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin against the royal Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Branzardo thought, in this distress, to truck;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knowing through sure spy, Astolpho led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Nubians, to that chief the offer sped.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A paladin himself, Astolpho knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gladly ought a paladin to free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when that case the Moorish envoy shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To King Branzardo’s offer does agree.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dudon from prison loosed, his thanks bestows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whatsoe’er pertains to land or sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bestirs him to accomplish, in accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his illustrious chief, the English lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho leading such a countless band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might have well seven Africas opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And recollecting ’twas the saint’s command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who upon him whilere imposed the quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fair Provence and Aquamorta’s strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the reaving Saracen should wrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made through his numerous host a second draught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of such as least inapt for sea he thought;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And filling next as full as they could be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hands with many different sorts of leaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plucked from palm, olive, bay and cedar tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached the shore, and cast them on the waves.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh blessed souls! Oh great felicity!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O grace! which rarely man from God receives;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O strange and wondrous miracle, which sprung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of those leaves upon the waters flung!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They wax in number beyond all esteem;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Becoming crooked and heavy, long, and wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into hard timber turn and solid beam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The slender veins that branch on either side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taper the masts; and, moored in the salt stream,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All in a thought transformed to vessels, ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of as diverse qualities appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As are the plants, whereon they grew whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It was a miracle to see them grown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To galliot, galley, frigate ship, and boat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wondrous, that they with tackling of their own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are found as well as any barks afloat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lack there men to govern them, when blown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By blustering winds⁠—from islands not remote⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sardinia or Corsica, of every rate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pilot and patron, mariner and mate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Twenty-six thousand were the troop that manned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those ready barks of every sort and kind.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Dudon’s government, by sea or land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A leader sage, the navy was consigned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which yet lay anchored off the Moorish strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Expecting a more favourable wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To put to sea; when, freighted with a load</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of prisoners, lo! a vessel made the road.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She carried those, whom at the bridge of dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—On that so narrow place of battle met⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont took, as often has been said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant Olivier was of the set,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando’s kin, and, with them, prisoners led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were faithful Brandimart and Sansonet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With more; to tell whereof there is no need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of German, Gascon, or Italian seed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The patron, yet unweeting he should find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foes in the port, here entered to unload;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having left Argier many miles behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he was minded to have made abode;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because a boisterous, overblowing, wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had driven his bark beyond her destined road;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming himself as safe and welcome guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Progne, when she seeks her noisy nest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But when, arrived, the imperial eagle spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pards and golden lilies he descries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With countenance as sicklied o’er by dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stands, as one that in unwary guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has chanced on fell and poisonous snake to tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, in the grass, opprest with slumber lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, pale and startled, hastens to retire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that ill reptile, swoln with bane and ire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But no retreat from peril is there here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can the patron keep his prisoners down:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him thither Brandimart and Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet and those others drag, where known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And greeted are the friends with joyful cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By England’s duke and Danish Ogier’s son;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-467" id="noteref-467" epub:type="noteref">467</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who read that he who brought them to that shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should for his pains be sentenced to the oar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Otho’s son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-468" id="noteref-468" epub:type="noteref">468</a> kind welcome did afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto those Christian cavaliers, as said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who⁠—honoured at his hospitable board⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With arms and all things needful were purveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His going, for their sake, the Danish lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deferred, who deemed his voyage well delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To parley with those peers, though at the cost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of one or two good days, in harbour lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of Charles, and in what state, what order are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The affairs of France they gave advices true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told where he best could disembark, and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To most advantage of the Christian crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While so the cavaliers their news declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A noise is heard; which ever louder grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed by such a fierce alarm withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to more fears than one gave rise in all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The duke Astolpho and the goodly throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in discourse with him were occupied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed in a moment, on their coursers sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hurried where the Nubians loudest cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seeking wherefore that wide larum rung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here, now there⁠—those warlike lords espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A savage man, and one so strong of hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked and sole he troubled all that band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The naked savage whirled a sapling round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hard, so heavy, and so strong of grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That every time the weapon went to ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some warrior, more than maimed, opprest the plain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above a hundred dead are strewed around;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor more defence the routed hands maintain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that a war of distant parts they try;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For there is none will wait the champion nigh.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Astolpho, Brandimart, the Danish knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hastening towards that noise with Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remain astounded at the wondrous might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And courage which in that wild man appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, posting thither on a palfrey light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is seen a damsel, clad in sable gear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Brandimart in haste that lady goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both her arms about the warrior throws.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was fair Flordelice, whose bosom so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Burned with the love of Monodantes’ son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, when she left him prisoner to his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At that streight bridge, had nigh distracted gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From France had she past hither⁠—given to know⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that proud paynim, who the deed had done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How Brandimart, with many cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was prisoner in the city of Algiers.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When now she for that harbour would have weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An eastern vessel in Marseilles she found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which thither had an ancient knight conveyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Monodantes’ household; a long round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek his Brandimart that lord had made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By sea, and upon many a distant ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he, upon his way, had heard it told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How he in France should find the warrior bold.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She knowing old Bardino in that wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bardino who from Monodantes’ court</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With little Brandimart had taken flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reared his nursling in <b>The Sylvan Fort</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then hearing what had thither brought the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her had made him loosen from the port;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Relating to that elder, by what chance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart had to Afric passed from France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as landed, “that Biserta lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besieged by good Astolpho’s band,” they hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That Brandimart is with him in the emprise,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They learn, but learn not as a matter clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now in such haste to him the damsel flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she beholds her faithful cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As plainly shows her joy; which woes o’erblown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had made the mightiest she had ever known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The gentle baron no less gladly eyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His faithful and beloved consort’s face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her whom he prized above all things beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clipt and welcomed her with loving grace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor his warm wishes would have satisfied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A first, a second, or a third embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he spied Bardino, he that came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From France, together with that faithful dame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He stretched his arms, and would embrace the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—wherefore he was come⁠—would bid him say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But was prevented by the sudden flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the sacred host, which fled in disarray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the club of that mad, naked wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with the brandished sapling cleared his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flordelice viewed the furious man in front;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cried to Brandimart, “Behold the count!”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the same time, withal, Astolpho bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That this was good Orlando plainly knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By signs, whereof those ancient saints had told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the earthly paradise, as tokens true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None of those others, who the knight behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courteous baron in the madman view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from long self-neglect, while wild he ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had in his visage more of beast than man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With breast and heart transfixed with pity, cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Valiant Astolpho⁠—bathed with many a tear⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turning to Danish Dudon, at this side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards to valiant Olivier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Behold Orlando!” Him awhile they eyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Straining their eyes and lids; then knew the peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, seeing him in such a piteous plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were filled with grief and wonder at the sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So grieve and so lament the greater part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those good warriors, that their eyes o’erflow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“ ’Tis time” (Astolpho cried) “to find some art</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To heal him, not indulge in useless woe;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his courser sprang: bold Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olivier, Sansonet and Dudon so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All leap to ground, and all together make</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At Roland, whom the warriors fain would take.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeing the circle round about him grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Levels his club that furious paladin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes fierce Dudon feel (who⁠—couched below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His buckler⁠—on the madman would break in)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How grievous is that staff’s descending blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And but that Olivier, Orlando’s kin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broke in some sort its force, that stake accurst</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had shield and helmet, head and body burst.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It only burst the shield, and in such thunder</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broke on the casque, that Dudon prest the shore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that, Sir Sansonet cut clean asunder</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sapling, shorn of two cloth-yards and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vigorous was that warrior’s stroke, while under</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bosom, Brandimart girt Roland sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sinewy arms about his body flung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the champion’s legs Astolpho clung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando shook himself, and England’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ten paces off, reversed upon the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet loosed not Brandimart, who with more might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And better hold had clasped the madman round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Olivier, too forward in that fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He dealt so furious and so fell a wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his clenched fist, that pale the marquis fell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And purple streams from eyes and nostrils well;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And save his morion had been more than good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Olivier had breathed his last, who lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So battered with his fall, it seemed he wou’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bequeath his parting soul to paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho and Dudon, that again upstood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Albeit swoln were Dudon’s face and eyes)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Sansonet, who plied so well his sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All made together at Anglantes’ lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dudon Orlando from behind embraced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with his foot the furious peer would throw:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho and others seize his arms; but waste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their strength in all attempts to hold the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He who has seen a bull, by mastiffs chased</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gore his bleeding ears, in fury lowe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragging the dogs that bait him there and here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet from their tusks unable to get clear;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let him imagine, so Orlando drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho and those banded knights along.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile upstarted Oliviero, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that fell fistycuff on earth was flung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, seeing they could ill by Roland do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>That</em> sought by good Astolpho and his throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He meditates, and compasses, a way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The frantic paladin on earth to lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He many a hawser made them thither bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And running knots in them he quickly tied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on the count’s waist, arms, and legs, they fling;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then, among themselves, the ends divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conveyed to this or that amid the ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Compassing Roland upon every side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warriors thus Orlando flung parforce,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As farrier throws the struggling ox or horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as down, they all upon him are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hands and feet more tightly they constrain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shakes himself, and plunges here and there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all his efforts for relief are vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho bade them hence the prisoner bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For he would heal (he said) the warrior’s brain.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shouldered by sturdy Dudon is the load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the beach’s furthest brink bestowed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seven times Astolpho makes them wash the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seven times plunged beneath the brine he goes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they cleanse away the scurf and blight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to his stupid limbs and visage grows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This done, with herbs, for that occasion dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They stop his mouth, wherewith he puffs and blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, save his nostrils, would Astolpho leave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No passage whence the count might air receive.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Valiant Astolpho had prepared the vase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein Orlando’s senses were contained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his nostrils in such mode conveys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, drawing-in his breath, the county drained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mystic cup withal. Oh wondrous case!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The unsettled mind its ancient seat regained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in its glorious reasonings, yet more clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lucid waxed his wisdom than whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As one, that seems in troubled sleep to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abominable shapes, a horrid crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Monsters which are not, and which cannot be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or seems some strange, unlawful thing to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet marvels at himself, from slumber free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When his recovered senses play him true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So good Orlando, when he is made sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remains yet full of wonder, and astound.</span>
			</p>

				<span>Aldabelle’s brother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-469" id="noteref-469" epub:type="noteref">469</a> Monodantes’ son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-470" id="noteref-470" epub:type="noteref">470</a></span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wondering marked, but word he spake to none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when and how he was brought thither, thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turned his restless eyes now up now down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor where he was withal, imagined aught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marvelling why he there was naked cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wherefore tethered, neck and heels, so fast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then said, as erst Silenus said⁠—when seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And taken sleeping the cave of yore⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><b>Solvite Me</b>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-471" id="noteref-471" epub:type="noteref">471</a> with visage so serene,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With look so much less wayward than before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That him they from his bonds delivered clean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And raiment to the naked warrior bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All comforting their friend, with grief opprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that delusion which had him possest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When to his former self he was recovered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of wiser and of manlier mind than e’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From love as well was freed the enamoured lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, so gentle deemed, so fair whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by renowned Orlando so adored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did but to him a worthless thing appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What he through love had lost, to reacquire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was his whole study, was his whole desire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile Bardino told to Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How Monodantes, his good sire, was dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, on his brother, Gigliantes’ part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To call him to his kingdom had he sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as from those isles, which most apart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From other lands, in eastern seas are spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That prince’s fair inheritance; than which</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was none more pleasant, populous, or rich.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said, mid many reasons which he prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That home was sweet, and⁠—were the warrior fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To taste that sweet⁠—he ever would detest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wandering life;” and Brandimart again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Replies, “Through all that war, he will not rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From serving Roland and King Charlemagne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after, if he lives to see its end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his own matters better will attend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the following day, for Provence steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The shipping under Danish Dudon’s care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When with the duke retired Anglantes’ peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heard that lord the warfare’s state declare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then prest with siege Biserta, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let good England’s knight the honour wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of every vantage; while Astolpho still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all was guided by Orlando’s will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The order taken to attack the town</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of huge Biserta, when, and on what side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How, at the first assault, the walls are won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with Orlando who the palm divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lament not that I now shall leave unshown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since for short time I lay my tale aside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the meanwhile, how fierce an overthrow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moors received in France, be pleased to know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Well nigh abandoned was their royal lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his worst peril; for to Arles again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had gone, with many of the paynim horde,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sage Sobrino and the king of Spain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, for the deemed the land unsafe, aboard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their barks sought refuge, with a numerous train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Barons and cavaliers, that served the Moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who moved by their example put from shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet royal Agramant the fight maintains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when he can no longer make a stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turns from the combat, and directly strains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Arles, not far remote, upon the strand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him Rabican pursues, with flowing reins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Aymon’s daughter drives with heel and hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him would she slay, through whom so often crost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That martial maid had her Rogero lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa by the same desire was stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had her thoughts on tardy vengeance placed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her dead sire; and as she fiercely spurred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made her hot courser feel his rider’s haste.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither martial maid, amid that herd</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of flying Moors, so well the monarch chased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to o’ertake him in his swift retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First into Arles, and then aboard his fleet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As two fair generous pards, that from some crag</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together dart, and stretch across the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they perceive that vigorous goat or stag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their nimble quarry, is pursued in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if ashamed they in that chase did lag,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return repentant and in high disdain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, with a sigh, return those damsels two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When they the paynim king in safety view:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet therefore halt not, but in fury go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid that crowd, which flies, possest with dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feeling, now here, now there, at every blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many that never more uprear their head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To evil pass was brought the broken foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For safety was not even for them that fled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Agramant, a sure retreat to gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade shut the city-gate which faced the plain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And bade on Rhone break all the bridges down.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unhappy people, ever held as cheap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Weighed with the tyrant’s want who wears a crown⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As worthless herd of goats or silly sheep!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These in the sea, those in the river drown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those with blood the thirsty fallows steep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Franks few prisoners made, and many slew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ransom in that battle was for few.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of the great multitude of either train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Christened or paynim, killed in that last fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though in unequal parts (for, of the slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By far more Saracens were killed in flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By hands of those redoubted damsels twain),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Signs even to this day remain in sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, hard by Arles, where sleeps the lazy Rhone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The plain with rising sepulchres is strown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile his heavy ships of deepest draught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant had made put forth to sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving some barks in port⁠—his lightest craft⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For them that would aboard his navy flee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stays two days, while they the stragglers waft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for the winds are wild and contrary,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the third day, to sail he give command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In trust to make return to Afric’s land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Royal Marsilius, in that fatal hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing the costs will fall upon his Spain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that the clouds, which big with tempest lower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the end will burst upon his fields and grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes for Valentia; where he town and tower</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begins to fortify with mickle pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for that war prepares, which after ends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the destruction of himself and friends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Agramant his sails for Afric bent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His barks ill-armed and almost empty go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Empty of men, but full of discontent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that three-fourths had perished by the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As cruel some, as weak and proud some shent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their king, and (as still happens in like woe)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All hate him privily; but, for they fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fury, in his presence mute appear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet sometimes two or three their lips unclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Some knot of friends, where each on each relies⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And their pent choler and their rage expose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet Agramant beneath the illusion lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That each will love and pity overflows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this befalls, because he still espies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">False faces, hears but voices that applaud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nought but adulation, lies and fraud.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not in Biserta’s port his host to land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the sage king of Africa’s intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had sure news “<em>that</em> shore by Nubia’s band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was held,” but he so far above it meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To steer his Moorish squadron, that the strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should not be steep or rugged for descent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There would he disembark, and thence would aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith his people, broken and dismayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But favoured not by his foul destiny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was that intention, provident and wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which willed the fleet, from leaves of greenwood tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Produced upon the beach in wondrous guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, bound for France, now ploughed the foaming sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should meet the king at night; that from surprise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that dark, dismal hour, amid his crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worse panic and disorder might ensue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not yet to him have tidings been conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That squadrons of such force the billows plow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would he have believed in him who said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“A hundred barks had sprung from one small bough;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence for Africa the king had weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not fearing to encounter hostile prow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor has he watchmen in his tops to spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And make report of what they hence descry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas so those ships, by England’s peer supplied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Dudon, manned with good and armed crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which see that Moorish fleet at eventide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that strange armament forthwith pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assailed them unawares, and, far, and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among those barks their grappling-irons threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And linked by chains, to their opponents clung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When known for Moors and foemen by their tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In bearing down, impelled by winds that blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Propitious to the Danish chief’s intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those weighty ships so shocked the paynim foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That many vessels to the bottom went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, taxing wits and hands, to work them woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them with fire, sword, and stones the Christians shent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on their ships in such wide ruin pour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like tempest never vext the sea before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bold Dudon’s men, to whom unwonted might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And daring was imparted from on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Since the hour was come the paynims to requite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For more than one ill deed,) from far and nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moors so pestilently gall and smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant finds no shelter; from the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above, thick clouds of whistling arrows strike;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Around gleam hook and hatchet, sword and pike.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king hears huge and heavy stones descend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From charged machine or thundering engine sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, falling, poop and prow and broadside rend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Opening to ravening seas a mighty vent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than all the furious fires offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fires that are quickly kindled, slowly spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wretched crews would fain that danger shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever into direr peril run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One headlong plunged, pursued by fire and sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And perished mid the waters, one who wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster with arms and feet, his passage oared</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To other barque, already overfraught:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she repulsed the wretch that fain would board;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose hand, which too importunately sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To clamber, grasped the side, while his lopt arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And body stained the wave with life-blood warm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him, that to save his life i’ the waters thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, at the worst, to perish with less pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Since swimming profited the caitiff nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he perceived his strength and courage drain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the hungry fires from which the refuge sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fear of drowning hurries back again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He grasps a burning plank, and in the dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of dying either death, by both is sped.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This vainly to the sea resorts, whom spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or hatchet, brandished close at hand, dismay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For stone or arrow following in his rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Permit the craven to make little way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But haply, while it yet delights your ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere well and wisely done to end my lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than harp upon the theme so long</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to annoy you with a tedious song.</span>

				<span>Though an ill mind appear in simulation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for the most, such quality offends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis plain that this in many a situation</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is found to further beneficial ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And save from blame, and danger, and vexation;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since we converse not always with our friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this, less clear than clouded, mortal life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beset with snares, and full of envious strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If after painful proof we scarcely find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A real friend, through various chances sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom we may communicate our mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Keeping no watch upon our wandering thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What should the young Rogero’s lady kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do with Brunello, not sincere, but fraught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With treasons manifold, and false and tainted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As by the good enchantress truly painted?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She feigns as well with that deceitful scout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Fitting with him the father of all lies)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Watches his thievish hands in fear and doubt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And follows every motion with her eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When lo! a mighty noise is heard without!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O mighty mother! king of heaven!” she cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What thing is this I hear?” and quickly springs</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the place from whence the larum rings,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And sees the host and all his family,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, one to door, and one to window slips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With eyes upturned and gazing at the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if to witness comet or eclipse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there the lady views, with wondering eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What she had scarce believed from other’s lips</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A feathered courser, sailing through the rack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who bore an armed knight upon his back.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Broad were his pinions, and of various hue;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-68" id="noteref-68" epub:type="noteref">68</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seated between, a knight the saddle pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clad in steel arms, which wide their radiance threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wonderous course directed to the west:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There dropt among the mountains lost to view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this was, as that host informed his guest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And true the tale) a sorcerer, who made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now farther, now more near, his frequent raid.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“He, sometimes towering, soars into the skies;</span>

				<span class="i1">Then seems, descending, but to skim the ground:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of all beauteous women makes a prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, to their mischief, in these parts are found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, whether in their own or others’ eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed as fair, the wretched damsels round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(And all in fact the felon plunders) hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As fearing of the sun to be descried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A castle on the Pyrenean height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The necromancer keeps, the work of spell,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The host relates) “of steel, so fair and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All nature cannot match the wonderous shell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There many cavaliers, to prove their might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have gone, but none returned the tale to tell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that I doubt, fair sir, the thief enthralls</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or slays whoever in the encounter falls.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The watchful maid attends to every thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glad at her heart, and trusting to complete</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(What she shall compass by the virtuous ring)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The downfall of the enchanter and his seat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to the host⁠—“A guide I pray thee bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who better knows than me the thief’s retreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So burns my heart, (nor can I choose but go)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To strive in battle with this wizard foe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“It shall not need,” exclaimed the dwarfish Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For I, myself, will serve you as a guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who have the road set down, with other lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that you shall rejoice with me to ride.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He meant the ring, but further hint forbore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest dearly he the avowed should abide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she to him⁠—“Your guidance gives me pleasure.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meaning by this she hoped to win his treasure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What useful was to say, she said, and what</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might hurt her with the Saracen, concealed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well suited to her ends, the host had got</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A palfrey, fitting for the road or field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She bought the steed, and as Aurora shot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her rosy rays, rode forth with spear and shield:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And maid and courier through a valley wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello now before and now behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From wood to wood, from mount to mountain hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They clomb a summit, which in cloudless sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discovers France and Spain, and either shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As from a peak of Apennine the eye<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-69" id="noteref-69" epub:type="noteref">69</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May Tuscan and Sclavonian sea explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There, whence we journey to Camaldoli.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then through a rugged path and painful wended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which thence into a lowly vale descended.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A rock from that deep valley’s centre springs;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bright walls of steel about its summit go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this as high that airy summit flings,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it leaves all the neighbouring cliffs below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He may not scale the height who has not wings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vainly would each painful toil bestow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Lo! where his prisoners!” Sir Brunello cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Ladies and cavaliers, the enchanter sties.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarped smooth upon four parts, the mountain bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed fashioned with the plumb, by builder’s skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor upon any side was path or stair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which furnished man the means to climb the hill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The castle seemed the very nest and lair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of animal, supplied with plume and quill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here the damsel knows ’tis time to slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wily dwarf, and take the ring away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But deems it foul, with blood of man to stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unarmed and of so base a sort, her brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For well, without his death, she may obtain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The costly ring; and so suspends her hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello, off his guard, with little pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seized, and strongly bound with girding band:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to a lofty fir made fast the string;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from his finger first withdrew the ring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Neither by tears, nor groans, nor sound of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To move the steadfast maid the dwarf had power:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She down the rugged hill descended slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until she reached the plain beneath the tower.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then gave her bugle breath, the keep below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To call the castled wizard to the stower:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when the sound was finished, threatening cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And called him to the combat and defied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not long within his gate the enchanter stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After he heard the voice and bugle ring.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the foe, who seemed a man, arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms, with him the horse is on the wing.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his appearance well consoled the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, with small cause for fear, beheld him bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor mace, nor rested lance, nor bitting sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith the corselet might be bruised or gored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In his left arm alone his shield he took,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covered all o’er with silk of crimson hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his right-hand he held an open book,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence, as the enchanter read, strange wonder grew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For often times, to sight, the lance he shook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And flinching eyelids could not hide the view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With tuck or mace he seemed to smite the foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But sate aloof and had not struck a blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No empty fiction wrought by magic lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But natural was the steed the wizard pressed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him a filly to griffin bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hight hippogryph. In wings and beak and crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Formed like his sire, as in the feet before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But like the mare, his dam, in all the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such on Riphaean hills, though rarely found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are bred, beyond the frozen ocean’s bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Drawn by enchantment from his distant lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wizard thought but how to tame the foal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in a month, instructed him to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saddle and bit, and gallop to the goal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And execute on earth or in mid air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All shifts of manege, course and caracole;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with such labour wrought. This only real,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where all the rest was hollow and ideal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This truth by him with fictions was combined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose sleight passed red for yellow, black for white:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all his vain enchantments could not blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The maid, whose virtuous ring assured her sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet she her blows discharges at the wind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spurring here and there prolongs the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So drove or wheeled her steed, and smote at nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And practised all she had before been taught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When she sometime had fought upon her horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from the courser on her feet descends:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To compass and more freely put in force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As by the enchantress schooled, her wily ends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wizard, to display his last resource,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unweeting the defence, towards her wends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bares the shield, secure to blind his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the magic light, astonished, throw.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The shield might have been shown at first, nor he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Needed to keep the cavaliers at bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he loved some master-stroke to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achieved by lance or sword in single fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As with the captive mouse, in sportive glee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wily cat is sometimes seen to play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till waxing wroth, or weary of her prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She bites, and at a snap the prisoner dies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To cat and mouse, in battles fought before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I liken the magician and his foes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the comparison holds good no more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, with the ring, the maid against him goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm and attentive still, and watching sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest upon her the wizard should impose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as she sees him bare the wondrous shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Closes her eyes and falls upon the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not that the shining metal could offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As wont those others, from its cover freed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But so the damsel did, to make descend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vain enchanter from his wondrous steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was in ought defeated of her end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she no sooner on the grassy mead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had laid her head, than wheeling widely round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flying courser pitched upon the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already cased again, the shield was hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the magician, at his sadle bow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He lights and seeks her, who like wolf among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bushes, couched in thicket, waits the roe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She without more delay from ambush sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he drew near, and grappled fast the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That wretched man, the volume by whose aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He all his battles fought, on earth had laid:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ran to bind her with a chain, which he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Girt round about him for such a purpose, wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he deemed she was no less to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mastered and bound than those subdued before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him hath the dame already flung; by me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excused with reason, if he strove not more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For fearful were the odds between that bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And puissant maid, and warrior weak and old!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Intending to behead the fallen foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She lifts her conquering hand; but in mid space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she beholds his visage, stops the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if disdaining a revenge so base.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She sees in him, her prowess has laid low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A venerable sire, with sorrowing face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose hair and wrinkles speak him, to her guess,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of years six score and ten, or little less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Kill me, for love of God!” (afflicted sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The old enchanter full of wrath did cry)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the victorious damsel was not more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Averse to kill, than he was bent to die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To know who was the necromancer hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle lady had desire, and why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tower he in that savage place designed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doing such outrage foul to all mankind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor I, by malice moved, alas! poor wight,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(The weeping necromancer answer made,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Built the fair castle on the rocky height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet for rapine ply the robber’s trade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But only to redeem a gentle knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From danger sore and death, by love was swayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, as the skies foreshow, in little season,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is doomed to die a christian, and by treason.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The sun beholds not ’twixt the poles, a Child</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So excellent as him, and passing fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from his infancy, Rogero styled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Atlantes I) was tutored by my care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By love of fame and evil stars beguiled,</span>

				<span class="i1">He follows into France Troyano’s heir.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-70" id="noteref-70" epub:type="noteref">70</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, in my eyes, than son esteemed more dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I seek to snatch from France and peril near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I only built the beauteous keep to be</span>

				<span class="i1">Rogero’s dungeon, safely harboured there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who whilom was subdued in fight by me,</span>

				<span class="i1">As I to-day had hoped thyself to snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And dames and knights, and more of high degree,</span>

				<span class="i1">Have to this tower conveyed, his lot to share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with such partners of his prison pent,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Whatever heart can wish or tongue can sound)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cates, brave attire, game, sport, or mirthful measure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My field well sown, I well had reaped my grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that thy coming makes my labour vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! then unless thy heart less beauteous be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than thy sweet face, mar not my pious care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Take my steel buckler, this I give to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And take that horse, which flies so fast in air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor meddle with my castle more; or free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One or two captive friends, the rest forbear⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or (for I crave but this) release them all,</span>

				<span class="i1">So that Rogero but remain my thrall.</span>

				<span>“Or if disposed to take him from my sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the youth be into France conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be pleased to free my miserable sprite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From its now rotted bark, long decayed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Prate as thou wilt, I shall restore the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To liberty,” replied the martial maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor offer shield and courser to resign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which are not in thy gift⁠—already mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor were they thine to take or to bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would it appear that such exchange were wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou sayest to save him from what stars foreshow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cheat an evil influence of the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero is confined. Thou canst not know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or knowing, canst not change his destinies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, if unknown an ill so near to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far less mayest thou another’s fate foresee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Seek not thy death from me; for the petition</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is made in vain; but if for death thou sigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though the whole world refused the requisition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A soul resolved would find the means to die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ope thy gates to give thy guests dismission</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before thine hand the knot of life untie.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So spake the scornful dame with angry mock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speeding her captive still towards the rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Round by the conqueror with the chain he bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atlantes walked, the damsel following nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who trusted not to the magician hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although he seemed subdued in port and eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor many paces went the pair, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They at the mountain’s foot the cleft espy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With steps by which the rugged hill to round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And climb, till to the castle-gate they wound:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Atlantes from the threshold, graved by skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With characters and wondrous signs, upturned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A virtuous stone, where, underneath the sill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pots, with perpetual fire and secret, burned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The enchanter breaks them; and at once the hill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To an inhospitable rock is turned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor wall nor tower on any side is seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if no castle there had ever been.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then from the lady’s toils the wizard clears<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-71" id="noteref-71" epub:type="noteref">71</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His limbs, as thrush escapes the fowler’s snare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him as well his castle disappears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And leaves the prisoned troop in open air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From their gay lodgings, dames and cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unhoused upon that desert, bleak and bare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many at the freedom felt annoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which dispossessed them of such life of joy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There is Gradasso, there is Sacripant,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-72" id="noteref-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a></span>

				<span class="i1">And there, at last, the lovely Bradamant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discerns Rogero, long desired and dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when assured it was that lady, flew</span>

				<span>As her he prized before his eyes, his heart,</span>

				<span class="i1">His life; from that day cherished when she stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uncasqued for him, and from the fight apart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence an arrow drank her virgin blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere long to tell who launched the cruel dart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how the lovers wandered in the wood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now guided by the sun, and now benighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here first since that encounter reunited.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now that the stripling sees her here, and knows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone she freed him from the wizard’s nest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deems, his bosom with such joy overflows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he is singly fortunate and blest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where late the damsel conquered, goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The band, descending from the mountain’s crest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finds the hippogryph, who bore the shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in its case of crimson silk concealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To take him by the rein the lady there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached, and he stood fast till she was nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then spread his pinions to the liquid air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at short distance lit, half-mountain high:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as she follows him with fruitless care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor longer flight nor shorter will he try.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis thus the raven, on some sandy beach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lures on the dog, and flits beyond his reach.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gradasso, Sacripant, Rogero, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all those other knights below were met,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er, they hope he may return, pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beast, and up and down, each pass beset.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He having led those others, as he flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often to rocky height, and bottom wet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the rocks of the moist valley dropt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at short distance from Rogero stopt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was Atlantes the enchanter’s deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose pious wishes still directed were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see Rogero from his peril freed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This was his only thought, his only care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for such end dispatched the winged steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him out of Europe by this sleight to bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero took his bridle, but in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he was restive to the guiding rein.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now the bold youth from his Frontino flings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Frontino was his gentle courser hight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then leaps on him who towers in air, and stings</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goads his haughty heart with rowels bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He runs a short career; then upward springs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And through mid ether soars a fairer flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than hawk, from which the falconer plucks away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In time the blinding hood, and points her prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When her Rogero the fair dame discerned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fearful peril, soar so high a strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She stood long space amazed, ere she returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her right judgement, and sound wits again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what she erst of Ganymede had learned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Snatched up to heaven from his paternal reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feared might befall the stripling, born through air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As gentle as young Ganymede and fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She on Rogero looks with steadfast eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As long as feeble sight can serve her use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in her mind next tracks him through the skies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When sight in vain the cherished youth pursues.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still renewing tears, and groans, and sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will not afford her sorrow peace or truce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After the knight had vanished from her view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her eyes she on the good Frontino threw</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And lest the courser should become the prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the first traveller, who passed the glen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him will not leave; but thence to bear away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolves, in trust to see his lord again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The griffin soars, nor can Rogero stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flying courser; while, beneath his ken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each peak and promontory sinks in guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he discerns not flat from mountain-rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the hippogryph has won such height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he is lessened to a point, he bends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His course for where the sun, with sinking light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he goes round the heavenly crab, descends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shoots through air, like well-greased bark and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which through the sea a wind propitious sends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him leave we on his way, who well shall speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turn we to Rinaldo in his need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Day after day the good Rinaldo fares,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forced by the wind, the spacious ocean through;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now westward borne, and now toward the <b>Bears</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For night and day the ceaseless tempest blew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scotland at last her dusky coast uprears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gives the Caledonian wood to view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, through its shadowy groves of ancient oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oft echoes to the champion’s sturdy stroke.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through this roves many a famous cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renowned for feat in arms, of British strain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And throng from distant land, or country near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">French, Norse, of German knights, a numerous train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let none, save he be valiant, venture here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, seeking glory, death may be his gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Arthur, Galahalt, and Gauvaine fought,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-73" id="noteref-73" epub:type="noteref">73</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well Sir Launcelot and Tristram wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And other worthies of the table round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Of either table, whether old or new)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-74" id="noteref-74" epub:type="noteref">74</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose trophies yet remain upon the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proof of their valiant feats. Rinaldo true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith his armour and Bayardo found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And landed on the woody coast: The crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bade, with all the haste they might, repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Berwick’s neighbouring port, and wait him there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Without a guide or company he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through that wide forest; choosing now this way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now that, now other, as it might present</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hope of adventurous quest or hard assay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ere the first day’s circling sun is spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The peer is guested in an abbey gray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which spends much wealth in harbouring those who claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its shelter, warlike knight or wandering dame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monks and abbot to Mount Alban’s peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A goodly welcome in their house accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who asked, but not before with savoury cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He amply had his wearied strength restored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If in that tract, by errant cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often adventurous quest might be explored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which a man might prove, by dangerous deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If blame or glory were his fitting meed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They answered, in those woods he might be sure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many and strange adventures would be found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But deeds, there wrought, were, like the place, obscure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for the greater part, not bruited round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Then seek (they said) a worthier quest, secure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your works will not be buried underground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the glorious act achieved, as due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fame may your peril and your pain pursue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if you would your warlike worth assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepare the worthiest enterprise to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, e’er in times of old or present day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was undertaken by a cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our monarch’s daughter needs some friendly stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now sore bested, against a puissant peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio is the doughty baron’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would bereave her both of life and fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Her he before her father does pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perchance yet more for hatred than for right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vouches, to a gallery she updrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lover, seen by him, at dead of night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence death by fire will be the damsel’s due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such is our law, unless some champion fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her behalf, and, ere a month go by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nigh spent) upon the accuser prove the lie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Our impious Scottish law, severe and dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wills, that a woman, whether low or high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her state, who takes a man into her bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except her husband, for the offence shall die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is there hope of ransom for her head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless to her defence some warrior hie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as her champion true, with spear and shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Maintain her guiltless in the listed field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The king, sore grieving for Geneura bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such is his unhappy daughter’s name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proclaims by town and city, that the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who shall deliver her from death and shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to the royal damsel will unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With dower, well suited to a royal dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the valiant warrior who has stood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her defence, be come of gentle blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But if within a month no knight appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or coming, conquer not, the damsel dies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A like emrpize were worthier of your spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than wandering through these woods in lowly guise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides, the eternal trophy you shall rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You by the deed shall gain a glorious prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sweetest flower of all the ladies fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That betwixt Ind and Atlas’ pillars are.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And you with wealth and state shall guerdoned be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that you evermore may live content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the king’s grace, if through your means he see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His honour raised anew, now well-nigh spent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides, you by the laws of chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are bound to venge the damsel foully shent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she, whose life is by such treason sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is chaste and spotless in the common thought.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo mused awhile, and then replied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And must a gentle damsel die by fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because she with a lover’s wish complied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quenched within her arms his fond desire?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cursed be the law by which the dame is tried!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cursed he who would permit a doom so dire!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perish (such fate were just!) who cruel proves!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not she that life bestows on him who loves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Or true or false Geneura’s tale of shame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she her lover blessed I little heed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this my praise the lady well might claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If manifest were not that gentle deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My every thought is turned to aid the dame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grant me but one to guide my steps, and lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly to where the foul accuser stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I trust in God to loose Geneura’s bands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I will not vouch her guiltless in my thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fear to warrant what is false; but I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Boldly maintain, in such an act is nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For which the damsel should deserve to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ween unjust, or else of wit distraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who statutes framed of such severity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, as iniquitous, should be effaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with a new and better code replaced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If like desire, and if an equal flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Move one and the other sex, who warmly press</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that soft end of love (their goal the same)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the witless crowd seems rank excess;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Say why shall woman⁠—merit scathe or blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though lovers, one or more, she may caress;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While man to sin with whom he will is free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And meets with praise, not mere impunity?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“By this injurious law, unequal still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On woman is inflicted open wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to demonstrate it a grievous ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I trust in God, which has been borne too long.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To good Rinaldo’s sentence, with one will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming their sires unjust, assents the throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their sires who such outrageous statute penned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And king, who might, but does not, this amend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the new dawn, with streaks of red and white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broke in the east, and cleared the hemisphere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo took his steed and armour bright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A squire that abbey furnished to the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him, for many leagues and miles, the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pricked through the dismal forest dark and drear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While they towards the Scottish city ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the poor damsel’s cause is to be tried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeking their way to shorten as they wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They to the wider track a path preferred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When echoing through the gloomy forest round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud lamentations nigh the road were heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards a neighbouring vale, whence came the sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This his Bayardo, that his hackney spurred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And viewed, between two grisly ruffians there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A girl, who seemed at distance passing fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But woe begone and weeping was the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As ever damsel, dame, or wight was seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hard by the barbarous twain prepared the blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To deluge with that damsel’s blood the green.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to delay her death awhile essayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until she pity moved with mournful mien.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This when Rinaldo near approaching eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thither drives with threats and furious cries.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ruffians turn their backs and take to flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as they the distant succour view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And squat within a valley out of sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor cares the good Rinaldo to pursue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her approaching, sues Mount Alban’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To say what on her head such evil drew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to save time, commands his squire to stoop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And take the damsel on his horse’s croup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as the lady nearer he surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her wise behaviour marked and beauty’s bloom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though her fait countenance was all dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the fear of death o’erspread with gloom.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again to know, the gentle knight essayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had prepared for her so fell a doom;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she began to tell in humble tone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What to another canto I postpone.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The diverse chances of that sea-fight dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here to rehearse would take a weary while;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to discourse to you upon this head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Great son of Hercules, were to Samos’ isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To carry earthen vessels, as ’tis said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Athens owls, and crocodiles the Nile.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, my lord, by what is vouched to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such things you saw, such things made others see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Your faithful people gazed on a long show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That night and day, wherein they crowded stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in a theatre, and hemmed on Po</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twixt fire and sword, the hostile navies viewed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What outcries may be heard, what sounds of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How rivers may run red with human blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In suchlike combat, in how many a mode</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men die, you saw, and you to many showed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I saw not, I, who was compelled to course,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evermore changing nags, six days before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Rome, in heat and haste, some helpful force</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him our mighty pastor to implore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, after, need was none of foot or horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so the lion’s beak and claws you tore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-472" id="noteref-472" epub:type="noteref">472</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that day unto this I hear not said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he more trouble in your land has bred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Trotto, present at this victory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afranio, Moro, Albert, Hannibal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbinat, Bagno, the Ariostos three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assured me of the mighty feat withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Certified after by that ensignry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspended from the holy temple’s wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fifteen galleys at our river-side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which with a thousand captive barks I spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He that those wrecks and blazing fires discerned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such sore slaughter, under different shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which⁠—venging us for hall and palace burned⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While bark remained, raged wide among the foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might also deem how Afric’s people mourned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Agramant, mid diverse deaths and woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On that dark night, when the redouted Dane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assaulted in mid sea the Moorish train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas night, nor gleam was anywhere descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When first the fleets in furious strife were blended;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when lit sulphur, pitch and tar from side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And poop and prow into the sky ascended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the destructive wildfire, scattered wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fed upon ship and shallop ill defended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The things about them all descried so clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That night was changed to day, as ’twould appear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hence Agramant, that by the dark deceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had rated not so high the foes’ array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to encounter such a force believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would, if ’twere opposed, at last give way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When that wide darkness cleared, and he perceived</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(What least he weened upon the first affray)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That twice as many were the ships he fought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As his own Moorish barks, took other thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Into a boat he with some few descends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brigliador and some precious things, to flee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so, twixt ship and ship, in silence wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he finds himself in safer sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far from his own; whom fiery Dudon shends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reduced to sad and sore extremity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Them steel destroys, fires burn, and waters drown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While he, that mighty slaughter’s cause, is flown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant flies, and with him old Sobrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant grieving he had not believed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time that sage foresaw with eye divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told the woe wherewith he is aggrieved.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But turn me to the valiant paladine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, before other aid can be received,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Counsels the duke Biserta to destroy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it no more may Christian France annoy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And hence in public order was it said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The camp should to its arms the third day stand;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, it was with many barks bested;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all were placed not at the Dane’s command.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fleet the worthy Sansonetto led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As good a warrior he by sea as land)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which a mile off the port, and overight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Biserta, now was anchored by the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando and the duke, like Christians true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which dare no danger without God for guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That fast and prayer be made their army through,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ordain by proclamation to be cried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that upon the third day, when they view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The signal, all shall bown them, far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Biserta’s royal city to attack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which they, when taken, doom to fire and sack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so, when now devoutly have been done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vigil and vow, and holy prayer and fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Kin, friends, and those to one another known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together feast; who, when with glad repast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their wasted bodies were refreshed, begun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To embrace and weep; and acts and speeches past,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the banquet’s close, amid those crews</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as best friends, about to sever, use.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The holy priests within Biserta’s wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pray with their grieving people, and in tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aye beat their bosoms, and for succour call</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon their Mahomet, who nothing hears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What vigils, offerings, and what gifts withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were promised silently, amid their fears!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What temples, statues, images were vowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In memory of their bitter woes, aloud!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, when the cadi hath his blessing said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people arms and to the rampart hies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As yet reposing in her Tithon’s bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aurora was, and dusky were the skies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to their posts, their several troops to head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Sansonetto, there Astolpho flies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when they hear Orlando’s signal blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assault with furious force Biserta’s town.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Washed by the sea, upon two quarters, were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The city walls, two stood on the dry shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of a construction excellent and rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein was seen the work of days of yore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of other bulwarks was the town nigh bare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For since Branzardo there the sceptre bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few masons at command, and little space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That monarch had to fortify the place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Nubian king is charged by England’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sling and arrow so the Moors to gall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That none upon the works shall dare appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, protected by the ceaseless fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of stone and dart, in safety cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And footman may approach the very wall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who loaded, some with plank, with rock-stone some,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And some with beam, or weightier burden, come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This and that other thing the Nubians bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by degrees filled-up that channel wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose waters were cut off the day before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that in many parts the ooze was spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filled is the ditch in haste from shore to shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And forms a level to the further side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cheering the footmen on the works to mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stand Olivier, Astolpho, and the Count.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Nubian upon hope of gain intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impatient of delay, nor heeding how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pressing perils they were compassed, went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Protected by the sheltering boar and sow.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-473" id="noteref-473" epub:type="noteref">473</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With battering ram, and other instrument,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To break the gate and make the turret bow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speedily to the city wall they post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor unprovided find the paynim host.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For steel, and fire, and roof, and turret there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In guise of tempest on the Nubians fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which plank and beam from those dread engines tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made for annoyance of the infidel.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the ill beginning, and while dim the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much injury the christened host befell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the sun from his rich mansion breaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fortune the faction of the Moor forsakes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The assault is reinforced on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Count Orlando, both by sea and land:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fleet, with Sansonetto for its guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entered the harbour, and approached the strand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sorely they with various engines plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With arrows and with slings, the paynim band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sent the assailants scaling-ladder, spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And naval stores, and every needful gear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando, Oliviero, Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, in air so daring heretofore,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-474" id="noteref-474" epub:type="noteref">474</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do fierce and furious battle on that part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which lies the furthest inland from the shore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each leads a portion of those Aethiops swart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ordered in equal bands beneath the four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who at the walls, the gateways, or elsewhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All give of prowess shining proofs and rare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So better could be seen each warrior’s claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in confused in combat there and here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of reward is worthy, who of shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a thousand and to watchful eyes is clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragged upon wheels are towers of wooden frame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And others well-trained elephants uprear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which so o’ertop the turrets of the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those bulwarks stand a mighty space below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Brandimart to the walls a ladder brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Climbed, and to climb withal to others cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many succeed, with bold assurance fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For none can fear beneath so good a guide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was there one who marked, nor one who thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of marking, if such weight it would abide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart only, on the foes intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clambered and fought, and grasped a battlement.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here clang with hand and foot the daring knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sprang on the embattled wall, and whirled his sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, showing mickle tokens of his might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynims charged, o’erthrew, hewed-down and gored</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all at once, o’erburthened with that weight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ladder breaks beneath the assailing horde;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, saving Brandimart, the Christians all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the ditch with headlong ruin fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not therefore blenched the valiant cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thought he of retreat, albeit was none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his own band that followed in his rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although he was a mark for all the town.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many prayed, the warrior would not hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prayer to turn; but mid the foes leapt down;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say, into the city took a leap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the town-wall was thirty cubits deep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, without any harm on the hard ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if on feathers or on straw, did light;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, like cloth shred and shorn, the paynims round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fury shreds and shears the valiant knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now springs on these, now those, with vigorous bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these and those betake themselves to flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They that without have seen the leap he made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too late to save him deem all human aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Throughout the squadrons a deep rumour flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A murmur and a whisper, there and here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From mouth to mouth, the Fame by motion grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told and magnified the tale of fear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For upon many quarters stormed that crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where good Orlando was, where Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Otho’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-475" id="noteref-475" epub:type="noteref">475</a> she flew on pinions light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever paused upon her nimble flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those warriors, and Orlando most of all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who love and prize the gentle Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing, should they defy upon that call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They would from so renowned a comrade part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their scaling-ladders plant, and mount the wall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rivalry, which shows the kingly heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who carry all such terror in their look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, at the very sight, their foemen shook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As on loud ocean, lashed by boisterous gale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The billows the rash bark assault, and still⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now threatening poop, now threatening prow⁠—assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in their rage and fury, fain would fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pilot sighs and groans, dismayed and pale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—He that should aid, and has not heart or skill⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length a surge the pinnace sweeps and swallows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wave on wave in long succession follows;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus when those win the wall, they leave a space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wide, that who beneath their conduct go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safely may follow them; for at its base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand ladders have been reared below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile the battering rams, in many a place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have breached that wall, and with such mighty blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bold assailant can, from many a part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bear succour to the gallant Brandimart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even with that rage wherewith the stream that reigns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king of rivers⁠—when he breaks his mound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes himself a way through Mantuan plains⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greasy furrows and glad harvests, round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with the sheepcotes, flock, and dogs and swains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears off, in his o’erwhelming waters drowned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over the elm’s high top the fishes glide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where fowls erewhile their nimble pinions plied;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Even with that rage rushed in the impetuous band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where many breaches in the wall were wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay with burning torch and trenchant brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That people, which to evil pass were brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Murder and rapine there, and violent hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dipt deep in blood and plunder, in a thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destroy that sumptuous and triumphant town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of all Afric wore the royal crown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Filled with dead bodies of the paynim horde,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blood issued from so many a gaping wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fouler fosse was formed and worse to ford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than girdles the infernal city round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From house to house the fire in fury poured;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mosque, portico, and palace, went to ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spoiled and empty mansions with the clang,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of beaten breast, and groan and outcry rang.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The victors, laden with their mighty prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that unhappy city’s gates are gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One with fair vase, and one with rich array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or silver plate from ancient altar won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mother this, that bore the child away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rapes and a thousand evil things were done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of much, and what they cannot hinder, hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renowned Orlando and fair England’s peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By Olivier, amid that slaughter wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell Bucifaro of the paynim band;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—every hope and comfort cast aside⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Branzardo slew himself with his own brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pierced with three wounds whereof he shortly died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Folvo was taken by Astolpho’s hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The monarchs three, intrusted to whose care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant’s African dominions were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Agramant, who had left without a guide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fleet this while, and with Sobrino fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wept over his Biserta when he spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those fires that on the royal city fed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When nearer now the king was certified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How in that cruel strife his town had sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thought of dying, and himself had slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that Sobrino’s words his arm restrain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What victory, my lord,” (Sobrino cries)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Could better than thy death the Christian cheer,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy being yet alive this hope denies;</span>

				<span>Eastward King Agramant had turned his prow;</span>

				<span class="i1">And seaward steered his bark, of Afric wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from the land a wicked wind ’gan blow,</span>

				<span>With juniper and myrtle overgrown,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In reverent wise and worthy of the twain,</span>

				<span class="i1">Those valiant kings embraced upon the strand:</span>

				<span class="i1">For friends the monarchs were, and late before</span>
				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With much displeasure Sericana’s knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heard by King Agramant his griefs displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then him consoled, and in his cause to fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like courteous king, the kindly offer made:</span>

				<span class="i1">“That thither it is perilous to wend,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Gradasso’s second offer seemed to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Most opportune to King Troyano’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And much he blest the chances of the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which him upon that desert isle had thrown:</span>

				<span class="i1">Yet would not upon any pact agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nay, not to repossess Biserta’s town⁠—</span>

			<p>
				<span>“If Roland is to be defied, more due</span>

				<span class="i1">The battle is to me (that king replies)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am prepared for it; and let God do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His will by me, in good or evil wise.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“⁠—Follow my mode; another mode and new,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which comes into my mind” (Gradasso cries),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Let both of us together wage this fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against Orlando and another knight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So not left out, I care not, if I be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first or last (said Agramant): I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms no better can I find than thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I should seek a comrade, high or low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what (Sobrino cried) becomes of me?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should be more expert if old in show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And evermore in peril it is good,</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stricken in years, yet vigorous was the sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well had proved himself with sword and spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said, “he found himself in gray old age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such as in green and supple youth whilere.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They own his claim, and for an embassage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith a courier find, then bid him “steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Africa, where camped the Christians lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Count Orlando on their part defy;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With equal number of armed knights to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Matching his foes, on Lampedosa’s shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where on all quarters that circumfluent sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which they are in-isled, is heard to roar.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim messenger unceasingly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one in needful haste, used sail and oar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he found Roland in Biserta, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The host beneath his eye their plunder share.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From those three monarchs to the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The invitation was in public told;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So pleasing to Anglante’s valiant peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the herald he was liberal of his gold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his companions had he heard whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Durindane was in Gradasso’s hold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, to retrieve that faulchion from the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To India had the Count resolved to go:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deeming he should not find that king elsewhere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, so he heard, had sailed from the French shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A nearer place is offered now; and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hopes Gradasso shall his prize restore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved also by Almontes’ bugle rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To accept the challenge which the herald bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less by Brigliadoro; since he knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Agramant’s possession were the two.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He chose for his companions in the fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faithful Brandimart and Olivier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well has he proved the one and the other’s might;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows he alike to both is passing dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good horses and good armour seeks the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goodly swords and lances, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him and his; meseems to you is known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How none of those three warriors had his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando (as I oft have certified)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fury <em>his</em> had scattered wide and far;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont took the others’, which beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The river, locked in that high turret are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Few throughout Africa could they provide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well because to France, in that long war,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant had born away the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As because Africa but few possest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What could be had of armour, rusted o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And brown with age, Orlando bids unite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile with his companions on the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He walks, discoursing on the future fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wandering from their camp three miles and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It chanced that, turning towards the sea their sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under full sail approaching, they descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A helmless barque, with nought her course to guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, without pilot, without crew, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As wind and fortune ordered it, was bound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vessel neared the shore, with sails full-blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Furrowing the waves, until she took the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ere of these three warriors more be shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The love wherewith I to the Child am bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his story brings me back, and bids record</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What past ’twixt him and Clermont’s warlike lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I spake of that good pair of warriors, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had both retreated from the martial fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholding pact and treaty broken through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every troop and band in disarray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which leader to his oath was first untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was occasion of such evil, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Study to learn of all the passing train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant or the Emperor Charlemagne.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile a servant of the Child’s, at hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Faithful, expert and wary was the wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in the shock of either furious band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had ever of his warlike lord lost sight⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bold Rogero bore his horse and brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might aid his comrades now in flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero backed the steed and grasped the sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not in battle mixed that martial lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence he departed; but he first renewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His compact with Montalban’s knight⁠—that so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Agramant convinced of perjury stood⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him and his evil sect he would forego.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That day no further feats of hardihood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero will perform against the foe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He but demands of all that make for Arles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who first broke faith, King Agramant or Charles?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From all he hears repeated, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Agramant had broke the promise plight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loves that king, and from his side to veer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, believes would be no error light.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-478" id="noteref-478" epub:type="noteref">478</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Moors were broke and scattered (this whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has been rehearsed) and from the giddy height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of <b>Her</b> revolving wheel were downward hurled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who at her pleasure rolls this nether world.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero ponders if he should remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or rather should his sovereign lord attend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love for his lady fits him with a rein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bit, which lets him not to Afric wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheels him, and to a counter course again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spurs him, and threats his restive mood to shend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save he maintains the treaty, and the troth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pledged to the paladin with solemn oath.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A wakeful, stinging care, on the other side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scourges and goads no less the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest, if he now from Agramant divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should be taxed with baseness or with fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If many deem it <em>well</em> he should abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To many and many it would <em>ill</em> appear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many would say, that oaths unbinding are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ’tis unlawful and unjust to swear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He all that day and the ensuing night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remains alone, and so the following day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forever sifting in his doubtful sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If it be better to depart or stay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lastly for Agramant decides the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him in Afric will he wend his way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved by his love for his liege-lady sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But moved by honour and by duty more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He made for Arles, where yet he hoped would ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fleet which him to Africa might bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor in the port nor offing ships espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Saracens save dead beheld he there.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Agramant had swept the roadstead wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And burnt what vessels in the haven were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero takes the road, when his hope fails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the sea-beat shore toward Marseilles.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon some boat he hoped to lay his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which him for love or force should thence convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already Ogier’s son had made the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the barbarians’ fleet, his captive prey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You could not there have cast a grain of sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between those vessels; moored closely lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty squadrons to that harbour brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With conquerors these, and those with prisoners fraught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The vessels of the Moor that were not made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The food of fire and water on that night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Saving some few that fled) were all conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safe to Marseilles by the victorious knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seven of those kings, that Moorish sceptres swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, having seen their squadron put to flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With their seven ships had yielded to the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood mute and weeping, overwhelmed with woe.</span>

			<p>
				<span>Dudon had issued forth upon dry land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bent to find Charlemagne that very day;</span>

				<span class="i1">And of the Moorish spoil and captive band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made in triumphal pomp a long display.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prisoners all were ranged upon the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And round them stood their Nubian victors gay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, shouting in his praise, with loud acclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made all that region ring with Dudon’s name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, when from far the ships he spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed they were the fleet of Agramant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to know further, pricked his courser’s side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, nearer, mid those knights of mickle vaunt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nasamon’s king a prisoner he descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agricalt, Bambirago, Farurant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Balastro, Manilardo, and Rimedont;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who stood with weeping eyes and drooping front.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In their unhappy state to leave that crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child, who loved those monarchs, cannot bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That useless is the empty hand he knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That where force is not, little profits prayer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He couched his lance, their keeper overthrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then proved his wonted might with faulchion bare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a moment stretched upon the strand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above a hundred of the Nubian band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The noise Sir Dudon hears, the slaughter spies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But knows not who the stranger cavalier:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He marks how, put to rout, his people flies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With anguish, with lament and mighty fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quickly for courser, shield, and helmet cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Bosom, and arms, and thighs, were mailed whilere)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaps on his horse, nor⁠—having seized his lance⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forgets he is a paladin of France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He called on every one to stand aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the galling spur his courser prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile a hundred other foes have died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And filled with hope was every prisoner’s breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as Rogero holy Dudon spied<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-479" id="noteref-479" epub:type="noteref">479</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approach on horseback, (footmen were the rest,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteeming him their head, he charged the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Impelled by huge desire to prove his might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already, on his part, had moved the Dane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when he saw the Child without a spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He flang is own far from him, in disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take such vantage of the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Admiring at Sir Dudon’s courteous vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Belie himself he cannot,” said the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And of those perfect warriors must be one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That as the paladins of France are known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If I my will can compass, he shall shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His name, to me, ere further deed be done.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made demand; and in the stranger knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dudon, the Danish Ogier’s valiant son:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from Rogero claimed an equal due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the Child as courteous answer won.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Their names on either side announced⁠—the foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bold defiance speak, and come to blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bold Dudon had with him that iron mace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which won him deathless fame in many a fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith he proved him fully of the race</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that good Danish warrior, famed for might.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That best of faulchions, which through iron case</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of cuirass or of casque was wont to bite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Youthful Rogero from the scabbard snatched,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the martial Dane his valour matched.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But for the gentle youth was ever willed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To offend his lady-love the least he could,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knew he should offend her, if he spilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that disastrous battle, Dudon’s blood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Well in the lineage of French houses skilled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wist of Beatrice’s sisterhood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Bradamant’s mother she⁠—with Armelline,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mother of the Danish paladine).</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He therefore never thrust in that affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rarely smote an edge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-480" id="noteref-480" epub:type="noteref">480</a> on plate and chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now warding off the mace, now giving way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the fall of that descending bane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turpin believes, it in Rogero lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Dudon in few sword-strokes to have slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet never when the Dane his guard foregoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save on the faulchion’s flat descend the blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The flat as featly as the edge he plies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that good faulchion forged of stubborn grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at strange blindman’s bluff, in weary wise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-481" id="noteref-481" epub:type="noteref">481</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hammers on Dudon with such might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He often dazzles so the warrior’s eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hardly he his saddle can maintain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to win better audience for my rhyme,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My canto I defer to other time.</span>

				<span>The odour which well-fashioned bear or hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that which find and dainty raiment steeps</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of gentle stripling, or of damsel fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Who often love awakens, as she weeps⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If it ooze forth and scent the ambient air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which for many a day its virtue keeps,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well shows, by manifest effects and sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How perfect was its first perfume and pure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The drink that to his cost good Icarus drew<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-482" id="noteref-482" epub:type="noteref">482</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of yore his sun-burned sicklemen to cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which (’tis said) lured Celts and Boi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-483" id="noteref-483" epub:type="noteref">483</a> through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our Alpine hills, untouched by toil whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well shows that cordial was the draught, when new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since it preserves its virtue through the year.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tree to which its wintry foliage cleaves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well shows that verdant were its spring tide leaves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The famous lineage, for so many years</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of courtesy the great and lasting light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ever, brightening as it burns, appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shine and flame more clearly to the sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well proves the sire of Este’s noble peers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must, amid mortals, have shone forth as bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all fair gifts which raise men to the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the glad sun mid glittering orbs on high.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in his every other feat exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s valiant mind and courteous lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were showed by tokens clear and manifest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his high-mindedness shone more and more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—So toward the Dane those virtues stood confest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whom (as I rehearsed to you before)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had belied his mighty strength and breath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For pity loth to put that lord to death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Danish warrior was well certified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No wish to slay him had the youthful knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who spared him now, when open was his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, when so wearied he no more could smite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When finally he knew, and plain descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero scrupled to put forth his might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If with less vigour and less prowess steeled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least in courtesy he would not yield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Pardi, sir, make we peace;” (he said) “success</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this contention cannot fall to me⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot be mine; for I myself confess</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conquered and captive to thy courtesy.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him Rogero answered, “and no less</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I covet peace, than ’tis desired by thee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this upon condition, that those seven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are freed from bondage, and to me are given.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With that he showed those seven whereof I spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bound and with drooping heads, a sad array;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Adding, “he must to him no hindrance make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would those kings to Africa convey.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Dudon thus allowed the Child to take</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those seven, and him allowed to bear away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bark as well; what likes him best he chooses</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid those vessels, and for Afric looses.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He looses bark and sail; and in bold wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trusting the fickle wind, to seaward stood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At first on her due course the vessel flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fills the pilot full of hardihood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beach retreats, and from the sailors’ eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fades, the sea appears a shoreless flood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the darkening of the day, the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Displays its fickle and perfidious kind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It shifts from poop to beam, from beam to prow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And even there short season doth remain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The reeling ship confounds the pilot; now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struck fore, now aft, now on her beam again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threatening the billows rise, with haughty brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Neptune’s white herd lows above the main.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As many deaths appear to daunt that rout,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As waves which beat their troubled bark about.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now blows the wind in front, and now in rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drives this wave an-end, that other back;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others the reeling vessel’s side o’erpeer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every billow threatens equal wrack.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pilot sighs, confused and pale with fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vainly he calls aloud to shift the tack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To strike or jibe the yard; and with his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Signs to the crew the thing he would command.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But sound or signal little boots; the eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sees not amid the dim and rainy night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The voice unheard ascends into the sky⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sky, which with a louder larum smite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The troubled sailors’ universal cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And roar of waters, which together fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unheard is every hest, above, below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Starboard or larboard, upon poop or prow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the strained tackle sounds a hollow roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein the struggling wind its fury breaks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The forked lightning flashes evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fearful thunder heaven’s wide concave shakes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One to the rudder runs, one grasps an oar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each to his several office him betakes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One will make fast, another will let go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Water into the water others throw.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! howling horribly, the sounding blast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Boreas in his sudden fury blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scourges with tattered sail the reeling mast:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almost as high as heaven the water flows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The oars are broken; and so fell and fast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That tempest pelts, the prow to leeward goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the ungoverned vessel’s battered side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is undefended from the foaming tide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fallen on her starboard side, on her beam ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About to turn keel uppermost, she lies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, his soul to Heaven each recommends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surer than sure to sink, with piteous cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scathe upon scathe malicious Fortune sends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when one woe is weathered, others rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erstrained, the vessel splits; and through her seams</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In many a part the hostile water streams.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A fierce assault and cruel coil doth keep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon all sides that wintry tempest fell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to their sight so high the billows leap,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems that these to heaven above would swell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, plunging with the wave, they sink so deep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That they appear to spy the gulfs of hell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small hope there is or none: with faultering breath</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They gaze upon inevitable death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On a despiteous sea, that livelong night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They drifted, as the wind in fury blew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The furious wind that with the dawning light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should have abated, gathered force anew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lo! a bare rock, ahead, appears in sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which vainly would the wretched band eschew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom towards that cliff, in their despite, impel</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The raging tempest and the roaring swell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Three times and four the pale-faced pilot wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tiller with a vigorous push to sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for the bark a surer passage sought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the waves snapt and bore the helm away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lower, or ease the bellying canvas aught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sailors had no power; nor time had they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mend that ill, or counsel what was best;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For them too hard the mortal peril prest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Perceiving now that nothing can defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their bark from wreck on that rude rock and bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All to their private aims alone attend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And only to preserve their life have care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who quickest can, into the skiff descend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in a thought so overcrowded are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through those so many who invade the boat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, gunwale-deep, she scarce remains afloat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, on beholding master, mate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And men abandoning the ship with speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In doublet, as he is, sans mail and plate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hopes in the skiff, a refuge in that need:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But finds her overcharged with such a weight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards so many more succeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the o’erwhelming wave the pinnace drown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she with all her wretched freight goes down;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Goes down, and, foundering, drags with her whoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving the larger bark, on her relies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then doleful shrieks are heard, ’mid sob and tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Calling for succour on unpitying skies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for short space that shrilling cry they rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, swoln with rage and scorn, the waters rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in a moment wholly stop the vent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence issues that sad clamour and lament.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One sinks outright, no more to reappear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some rise, and bounding with the billows go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their course, with head uplifted, others steer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An arm, an unshod leg, those others show:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, who the tempest will not fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Springs upward to the surface from below;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And little distant sees that rock, in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eschewed by him and his attendant train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Himself with hands and feet the warrior rows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping by force thereof to win the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Breast boldly the importunate flood, and blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his unwearied breath the foam before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Waxing meanwhile, the troubled water rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from the rock the abandoned vessel bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Quitted of those unhappy men, who die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So curst their lot) the death from which they fly.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alas! for man’s deceitful thoughts and blind!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ship escaped from wreck, where hope was none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When master and when men their charge resigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let the vessel without guidance run.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It would appear the wind has changed its mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On seeing all that sailed in her are gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And blows the vessel from those shallows free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through better course, into a safer sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, having drifted wildly with her guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without him, made directly Afric’s strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two or three miles of waste Biserta wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the quarter facing Egypt’s land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as the sea went down and the wind died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood bedded in that weary waste of sand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now thither Roland roved, who paced the shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As I in other strain rehearsed before;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And willing to discover, if alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laden, or light, the stranded vessel were,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-484" id="noteref-484" epub:type="noteref">484</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, Olivier, and Monodantes’ son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-485" id="noteref-485" epub:type="noteref">485</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aboard her in a shallow bark repair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the hatchways they descend, but none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of human kind they see; and only there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Find good Frontino, with the trenchant sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gallant armour of his youthful lord;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who was so hurried in his hasty flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had not even time to take his sword;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Orlando known; which, Balisardo hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was his erewhile; the tale’s upon record,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ye have read it all, as well I wite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Falerina lost it to that lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When waste as well her beauteous bowers he laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how from him Brunello stole the blade;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And how beneath Carena, on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brunello on Rogero this bestowed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How matchless was that faulchion’s edge and grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him experience had already showed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say, Orlando; who was therefore fain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to heaven’s king with grateful thanks o’erflowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed, and often afterwards so said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven for such pressing need had sent the blade:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such pressing need, in that he had to fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the redoubted king of Sericane;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knew that he, besides his fearful might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was lord of Bayard and of Durindane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not knowing them, Anglantes’ valiant knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So highly rated not the plate and chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he that these had proved: they valour were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But valued less as good than rich and fair;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, for of harness he had little need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charmed, and against all weapons fortified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Olivier he left the warlike weed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not so the sword; which to his waist he tied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Brandimart Orlando gave the steed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus equally that spoil would he divide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his companions twain, in equal share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who partners in that rich discovery were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Against the day of fight, in goodly gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And new, those warriors seek their limbs to deck.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blazoned upon Orlando’s shield appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The burning bold and lofty Babel’s wreck.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lyme-dog argent bears Sir Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Couchant, and with the leash upon his neck:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The motto; <b>Till He Comes</b>: in gilded vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And worthy of himself he will be drest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bold Brandimart designed upon the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of battle, for his royal father’s sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his own honour, no device more gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than a dim surcoat to the field to take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By gentle Flordelice for that dark array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was wrought the fairest facing she could make.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With costly jewels was the border sown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sable the vest, and of one piece alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With her own hand the lady wrought that vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Becoming well the finest plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein the valiant warrior should be drest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cloak his courser’s croup and chest and mane:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, from that day when she herself addrest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto this task, till ended was her pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She showed no sign of gladness; nor this while,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor after, was she ever seen to smile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The heartfelt fear, the torment evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of losing Brandimart the dame pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She him whilere a hundred times and more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Engaged in fierce and fearful fight had viewed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever suchlike terror heretofore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had blanched her cheek and froze her youthful blood;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this new sense of fear increased her trouble,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made the trembling lady’s heart beat double.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The warriors to the wind their canvas rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When point device the three accoutred are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Sansonet is left, with England’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intrusted with the faithful army’s care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flordelice, pricked at heart with cruel fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filling the heavens with vow, lament and prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As far as they by sight can followed be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Follows their sails upon the foaming sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scarce, with much labour, the two captains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-486" id="noteref-486" epub:type="noteref">486</a> led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, gazing on the waters, from the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the palace drew, where on her bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They left the lady, grieved and trembling sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile upon their quest those others sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom mercy wind and weather seaward bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their vessel made that island on the right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field appointed for so fell a fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando disembarks, with his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His kinsman Olivier and Brandimart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on the side which fronts the eastern ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encamp them, and not haply without art.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-487" id="noteref-487" epub:type="noteref">487</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Agramant arrives that very day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tents him on the contrary part.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for the sun is sinking fast, forborne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is their encounter till the following morn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Until the skies the dawning light receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed servants keep their watch both there and here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The valiant Brandimart resorts that eve</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thitherward, where their tents the paynims rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And parleys, by this noble leader’s leave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Agramant; for they were friends whilere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, underneath the banner of the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He into France had passed from Afric’s shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After salutes, and joining hand with hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair reasons, as a friend, the faithful knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pressed on the leader of the paynim band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why he should not the appointed battle fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every town⁠—restored to his command⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laying ’twixt Nile and Calpe’s rocky height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vowed he, with Roland’s license, should receive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If upon Mary’s Son he would believe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said; “For loved you were, and are by me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This counsel give I; that I deem it sane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I pursue it, you assured must be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mahound I hold but as an idol vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Jesus Christ, the living God I see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to conduct you in my way were fain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the way of safety fain would have you move</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With me and all those others that I love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In this consists your welfare; counsel none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save this, in your disaster, can avail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, of all counsels least, good Milo’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To meet in combat, clad in plate and mail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the profit, if the field be won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weighs not against the loss, in equal scale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you be conqueror, little gain ensues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet little loss results not, if you lose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Were good Orlando and we others slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Banded with him to conquer or to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherefore, through this, ye should your lost domain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Acquire anew, forsooth, I see not, I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is there reason hope to entertain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if we lifeless on the champaigne lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Men should be wanting in King Charles’s host</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To guard in Africa his paltriest post.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus Brandimart to Afric’s cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And much would have subjoined; but, on his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That knight, with angry voice and haughty cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pagan interrupted, and replied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“ ’Tis sure temerity and madness sheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moves you and whatsoever wight beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That counsels matter, be it good or ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uncalled a counsellor’s duty to fulfil;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And how to think, from love those counsels flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which once you bore and bear me, as you say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(To speak the very truth) I do not know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with Orlando see you here, this day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I ween that, knowing you are doomed to woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And marked for the devouring dragon’s prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ye all mankind would drag to nether hell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In your eternity of pains to dwell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If I shall win or lose, remount my throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or pass my future days in exile drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God only knows, whose purpose is unknown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me, in turn, or to Anglantes’ peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Befall what may, by me shall nought be done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unworthy of a king, through shameful fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If death must be my certain portion, I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than wrong my princely blood, will die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ye may depart, who, save ye better play</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior, in to-morrow’s listed fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then ye have plaid the embassador to-day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms will second ill Anglantes’ knight.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Agramant ended so his furious say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—His angry bosom boiling with despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So said⁠—the warriors parted, to repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till from the neighbouring sea the day arose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the first whitening of the dawn was seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed, in a moment leapt on horseback all;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short parley past the puissant foes between.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There was no stop; there was no interval;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For they have laid in rest their lances keen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I into too foul a fault should fall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseems, my lord, if, while their deeds I tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I let Rogero perish in the swell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Cleaving the flood with nimble hands and feet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He swims, amid the horrid surges’ roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him the threatening wind and tempest beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him his harassed conscience vexes more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Christ’s wrath he fears; and, since in waters sweet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(When time and fair occasion served of yore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, in his folly, baptism little prized,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fears in these bitter waves to be baptised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Those many promises remembered are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereby he to his lady-love was tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those oaths which sworn to good Rinaldo were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And were in nought fulfilled upon his side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To God, in hope that he would hear and spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he repented, oftentimes he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, should he land, and scape that mortal scaith,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be a Christian,” vowed in heart and faith;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And ne’er, in succour of the Moorish train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sword or lance, the faithful to offend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And into France, where he to Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would render honour due, forthwith to wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Bradamant with idle words again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cheat, but bring his love to honest end.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A miracle it is that, as he vows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He swims more lightly and his vigour grows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His vigour grows; unwearied is his mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still his arms from him the billow throw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This billow followed fast by that behind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof one lifts him high, one sinks him low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rising and falling, vext by wave and wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So gains the Child that shore with labour slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where the rocky hill slopes seaward most,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All drenched and dropping, climbs the rugged coast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All the others that had plunged into the flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the end, o’erwhelmed by those wild waters died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, as to Providence seemed good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mounted the solitary islet’s side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When safe upon the barren rock he stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A new alarm the stripling terrified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be within those narrow bounds confined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And die, with hardship and with hunger pined.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet he with an unconquered heart, intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To suffer what the heavens for him ordained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’er those hard stones, against that steep ascent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards the top with feet intrepid strained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not a hundred yards had gone, when, bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With years, and with long fast and vigil stained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He worthy of much worship one espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In hermit’s weed, descend the mountain’s side;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who cries, on his approaching him, “Saul, Saul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why persecutest thou my faithful seed?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As whilom said the Saviour to Saint Paul,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When (blessed stroke!) he smote him from his steed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thou thought’st to pass the sea, nor pay withal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought’st to defraud the pilot of his meed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou seest that God has arms to reach and smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When farthest off thou deem’st that God of might.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he, that holiest anchoret, pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom the night foregoing God did send</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A vision, as he slumbered, and foreshewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How, thither by his aid the Child should wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein his past and future life, reviewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were seen, as well as his unhappy end;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sons, and grandsons, and his every heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fully revealed to that good hermit were.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That anchoret pursues, and does upbraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero first, and comforts finally:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upbraideth him, because he had delayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath that easy yoke to bend the knee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what he should have done, when whilom prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And called of Christ⁠—then uncompelled and free⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had done with little grace; nor turned to God</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he saw him threatening with the rod.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then comforts him⁠—that Christ aye heaven allows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To them, that late or early heaven desire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all those labourers of the Gospel shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Paid by the vineyard’s lord with equal hire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With charity and warm devotion glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him instructs the venerable sire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As toward the rocky cell where he resides</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with weak steps and slow Rogero guides.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above that hallowed cell, on the hill’s brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A little church receives the rising day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Commodious is the fane and fair enow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to the beach descends a thicket gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where fertile and fruit-bearing palm-trees blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myrtle, and lowly juniper, and bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evermore threaded by a limpid fountain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which falls with ceaseless murmur from the mountain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twas well nigh forty years, since on that stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goodly friar had fixed his quiet seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, there to live a holy life, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him the Saviour chose, as harbourage meet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pure water was his drink, and, plucked from one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or the other plant, wild berries were his meat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hearty and robust, of ailments clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy man had reached his eightieth year.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That hermit lit a fire, and heaped the board</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With different fruits, within his small repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith the Child somedeal his strength restored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he had dried his clothes and dripping hair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After, at better ease, to him God’s word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mysteries of our faith expounded were;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the day following, in his fountain clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That anchoret baptised the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There dwells the young Rogero, well content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With what the rugged sojourn does allow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the friar showed shortly his intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To send him where he fain would turn his prow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile with him he many an argument</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Handles and often; of God’s kingdom now;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now of things appertaining to his case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now to Rogero’s blood, a future race.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Lord, that every thing doth see and hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had to that holiest anchoret bewrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he should not exceed the seventh year,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dating from when he was a Christian made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for the death of Pinabel whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(His lady’s deed, but on Rogero laid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as Bertolagi’s, should be slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By false Maganza’s ill and impious train;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, how that treason should be smothered so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sign thereof should outwardly appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For where that evil people dealt the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They should entomb the youthful cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this should vengeance follow, albeit slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dealt by his consort and his sister dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he by his wife should long be sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With weary womb, with heavy burden fraught,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Twixt Brenta and Athesis, beneath those hills</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Which erst the good Antenor so contented,</span>

				<span>And how the Child, in might and beauty grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, like his sire, Rogero shall be hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those Trojans, as of Trojan lineage known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall for their lord elect with solemn rite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who next by Charles (in succour of whose crown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the Lombards shall the stripling fight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that fair land dominion shall obtain,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(That is⁠—be lords of the dominion round!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entitled in a future season Este</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall with good omen be that beauteous ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus its ancient title of Ateste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall of its two first letters lose the sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">God also to his servant had foresaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vengeance taken for Rogero’s dead;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who shall, in vision, to his consort true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appear somedeal before the dawn of day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shall relate how him the traitor slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where his body lies to her shall say.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She and Marphisa hence, those valiant two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fire and sword on earth shall Poictiers lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor shall his son, when of befitting age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less harm Maganza in his mighty rage.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On Azos, Alberts, Obysons, did dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hermit hoar, and on their offspring bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Borso, Nicholas, and Leonel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alphonso, Hercules, and Hippolyte,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, last of those, the gentle Isabel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then curbs his tongue and will no more recite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to Rogero what is fit reveals,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what is fitting to conceal, conceals.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile Orlando and bold Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that good knight, the Marquis Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the paynim Mars together start;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Name well befitting Sericana’s peer)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the other two⁠—that from the adverse part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At more than a foot-pace their coursers steer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I say King Agramant and King Sobrine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pebbly beach resounds, and rolling brine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they encounter in mid field, pell-mell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the sky flew every shivered lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At that loud noise, the sea was seen to swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At that loud noise, which echoed even to France.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso and Roland met as it befell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fairly balanced might appear the chance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for the vantage of Rinaldo’s horse;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which made Gradasso seem of greater force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bayardo shocked the steed of lesser might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Backed by Orlando, with such might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made that courser stagger, left and right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And measure next his length upon the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vainly to raise him strove Anglantes’ knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrice, nay four times, with rowels and with rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Balked of his end, he lights upon the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Draws Balisarda, and uplifts his shield.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With Agramant encounters Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, fitly matched, their foaming coursers gall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Brandimart unhorsed in the career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino; but it was not plain withal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ’twas the fault of horse or cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For seldom good Sobrino used to fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was it his courser’s or his own misdeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino found himself without a steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now Brandimart, that upon earth descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king Sobrine, assailed no more his man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But at Gradasso, who Anglantes’ pride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had equally unhorsed, in fury ran.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Agramant and Oliviero’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile the warfare stood as it began:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When broken on their bucklers were the spears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With swords encountered the returning peers.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roland who saw Gradasso in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As showed that to return he little cared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nor can return; so Brandimart aye plies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And presses Sericana’s monarch hard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turns round, and, like himself, afoot descries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino, in the doubtful strife unpaired:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At him he sprang; and, at his haughty look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven, as the warrior trod, in terror shook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Foreseeing the assault with wary eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepared, and at close ward, behold the Moor!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As pilot against whom, now cresting nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The threatening billow comes with hollow roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards it turns his prow, and, when so high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He views the sea, would gladly be ashore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino rears his buckler, to withstand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The furious fall of Falerina’s brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of such fine steel was Balisarda’s blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That arms against it little shelter were;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by a person of such puissance swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Roland, singe in the world or rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It splits the shield, and is in nowise stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though bound about with steel the edges are:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It splits the shield, and to the bottom rends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the shoulder underneath descends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the shoulder; nor, though twisted chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And double plates encase the paynim foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These hinder much that sword of stubborn grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From opening wide the parted flesh below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino at Orlando smites; but vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the valiant count is every blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom, for special grace, the King of heaven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A body charmed against all arms had given.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The valorous count, redoubling still his blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought from the trunk the monarch’s head to smite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino, who the strength of Clermont knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how the shield ill boots, retired from fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not so far, but that upon his brows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell the dread faulchion of Anglantes’ knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas on its flat, but such his might and main,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It crushed the helm and stupefied the brain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Stunned by that furious stroke, he pressed the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And it was long ere he again did rise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladin believes the warfare o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that deprived of life Sobrino lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, lest Gradasso to ill pass and sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should bring Sir Brandimart, at him he flies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him the paynim overmatched in horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms and faulchion, and perhaps in force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bold Brandimart, who guides Frontino’s rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goodly courser, erst Rogero’s steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So well contends with him of Sericane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king yet little seems his foe to exceed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, if he had as tempered plate and chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that bold paynim lord, would better speed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But (for he felt himself ill-armed) the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often gave ground, and traversed left and right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Better than good Frontino horse is none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To obey upon a sign the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem that courser had the sense to shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sharp Durindana’s fall, now there now here.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile elsewhere is horrid battle done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By royal Agramant and Olivier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who may be deemed well matched in warlike sleight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor champions differing much in martial might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando had left Sobrino (as I said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth, and against Sericana’s pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desirous valiant Brandimart to aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even as he was, afoot, in fury hied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, prompt to assail Gradasso with the blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, loose and walking in mid field, espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The goodly horse, which had Sobrino thrown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bowned him straight to make the steed his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He seized the horse (for none the deed gainsaid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And took a leap, and vaulted on his prize.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This hand the bridle grasped, and that the blade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando’s motions good Gradasso spies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor at his coming is the king dismayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who by his name the paladin defies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him, and both his partners in the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hopes to make it dark before ’tis night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leaving his foe, he, facing Brava’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrust at the collar of his shirt of mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All else beside the flesh the faulchion bored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pierce through which would every labour fail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the same time descends Orlando’s sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Where Balisarda bites no spells avail)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shears helmet, cuirass, shield, and all below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleaves whate’er it rakes with headlong blow;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in face, bosom, and in thigh it seamed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath his mail, the king of Sericane,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From whom his blood till how had never streamed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he that armour wore; new rage and pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thereat the warrior felt, and strange it seemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sword cut so now, nor yet was Durindane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had Roland struck more home, or nearer been,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From head to belly he had cleft him clean.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No more in arms can trust the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As heretofore; for proved those arms have been:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with more care, more caution than whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prepares to parry with the faulchion keen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When entered Brandimart sees Brava’s peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who snatched that battle from him, he between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those other conflicts placed himself, that where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It most was needed, he might succour bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>While so the fight is balanced ’mid those foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino, that on earth long time had lain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to himself he was returned, uprose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In face and shoulder suffering grievous pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He lifts his face, his eyes about him throws;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither, where more distant on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees his leader, with long paces steers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So stealthily, that none his coming hears;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He on the Marquis<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-489" id="noteref-489" epub:type="noteref">489</a> came, who had but eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Agramant, and in the warrior’s rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wounded upon the hocks in such fierce wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser of unheeding Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he falls headlong; and beneath him lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His valiant master, nor his foot can clear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His left foot, which in that unthought for woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in the stirrup jammed, his steed below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sorbine pursued, and with back-handed blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought he his head should from his neck have shorn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this forbids that armour, bright of show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Vulcan hammered, and by Hector worn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart sees his risk, and at the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is by his steed, with flowing bridle, borne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino on the head he smote and flung;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But straight from earth that fierce old man upsprung;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And turned anew to Olivier, to speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior’s soul more promptly on its way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or at the least that baron to impede.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him beneath his courser keep at bay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Olivier, whose better arm was freed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with his sword could fend him as he lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile so smites and longes, there and here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That at sword’s length he holds the ancient peer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He hopes, if him but little he withstood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shall be straight delivered from that pain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sees him wholly strained and wet with blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he spills so much from open vein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould seem he speedily must be subdued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So weak he hardly can himself sustain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often and oft to rise the Marquis strove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet could not from beneath his courser move.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Brandimart has found out the royal Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And storms about that paynim cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon Frontino, like a lathe, before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside, or whirling in the warrior’s rear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A goodly horse the Christian champion bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor worse the southern king’s in the career:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Brigliador, Rogero’s gift he crost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile, by haughty Mandricardo lost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Great vantage has he, on another part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of proof and perfect is his iron weed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His at a venture took Sir Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he could have in haste in suchlike need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But hopes (his anger puts him so in heart)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To change it for a better coat with speech;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit the Moorish king, with bitter blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has made the blood from his right should flow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him in the flank Gradasso too had gored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor this was laughing matter) so had scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His vantage that redoubted paynim lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He found a place wherein to plant his brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He broke the warrior’s shield, his left arm bored,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And touched him slightly in the better hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But this was play, was pastime (might be said),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Roland’s and Gradasso’s battle weighed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gradasso has Orlando half disarmed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atop and on both sides his helm has broke:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fallen is his shield, his cuirass split; but harmed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior is not by the furious stroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which opened plate and mail; for he is charmed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And worser vengeance on the king has wroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In face, throat, breast has gored that cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the wounds whereof I spake whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gradasso, desperate when he descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself all wet, and smeared with sanguine dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Roland, all from head to foot espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After such mighty strokes unstained and dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking head, breast, and belly to divide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With both his hands upheaved his sword on high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, even as he devised, upon the front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote with mid blade Anglantes’ haughty count.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And would by any other so have done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Would to the saddle-tree have cleft him clean:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the good sword, as if it fell upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its flat, rebounds again, unstained and sheen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The furious stroke astounded Milo’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-490" id="noteref-490" epub:type="noteref">490</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom some scattered stars on earth were seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He drops the bridle and would drop the brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that a chain secures it to his hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So by the noise was scared the horse that bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his back Anglantes’ cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser scoured about the powdery shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Showing how good his speed in the career:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The County by that stroke astounded sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has not the power the frightened horse to steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso follows and will reach him, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he but little more pursues the foe;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But turning round, beholds the royal Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the utmost peril in that battle brought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For by the shining helmet which he wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the left hand, him Brandimart had caught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already had unlaced the casque before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with his dagger would new ill have wrought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor much defence could make the Moorish lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Brandimart as well had reft his sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Gradasso turned, nor more Orlando sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But hastened where he Agramant espied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The incautious Brandimart, suspecting nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando would have let him turn aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not Gradasso in his eyes or thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the paynim’s throat his knife applied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gradasso came, and at his helmet layed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wielding with either hand his trenchant blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Father of heaven! ’mid spirits chosen by thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him thy martyr true, a place accord;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-491" id="noteref-491" epub:type="noteref">491</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, having traversed his tempestuous sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now furls his sails in port. Ah! ruthless sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So cruel, Durindana, can’st thou be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To good Orlando, to thine ancient lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou can’st slaughter, in the warrior’s view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all his friends the dearest and most true?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>An iron ring that girt his helmet round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two inches thick, was broke by that fell blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleft; and with the solid iron bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was parted the good cap of steel below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold Brandimart, reversed upon the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With haggard face beside his horse lies low;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issuing widely from the warrior’s head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stream of life-blood dyes the shingle red.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Come to himself, the County turns his eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sees his Brandimart upon the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in such act Gradasso standing by</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As clearly shows by whom the knight was slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he most raged or grieved I know not, I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But such short time is left him to complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hasty wrath breaks forth, his grief gives way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now ’tis time that I suspend my lay.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The victory with Count Orlando lies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But good Rinaldo and Bradamant at heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(One for Angelica, the other sighs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For young Rogero) suffer cruel smart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him that in chase of the Indian damsel hies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disdain preserves; from thence does he depart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards Italy, and is with courteous cheer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And welcome guested by a cavalier.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>What bit, what iron curb is to be found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or (could it be) what adamantine rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That can make wrath keep order and due bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And within lawful limits him contain?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When one, to whom the constant heart is bound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And linked by Love with solid bolt and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We see, through violence or through foul deceit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With mortal damage or dishonour meet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And is the mind sometimes, if so possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To ill and savage action led astray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It may deserve excuse; in that the breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more is under Reason’s sovereign sway.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Achilles, when, beneath his borrowed crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw Patroclus crimsoning the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was with his murderer’s slaughter ill content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he his mangled corse had dragged and shent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Unconquered Duke Alphonso, anger so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed thy host<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-492" id="noteref-492" epub:type="noteref">492</a> the day that weighty stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wounded thy forehead with such grievous blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all believed it to its rest was gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Inflamed them with such fury, for the foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In rampart, fosse, or wall, defence was none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, one and all, within their works lay dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor wight was left the woeful news to spread.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Seeing thy fall caused thine such mighty pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They were to fury moved: hadst thou, my lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Maintained thy footing, haply might thy train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have with less licence plied the murderous sword.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough for thee thy Bastìa to regain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fewer hours replaced beneath thy ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then Cordova’s and fierce Granada’s band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took days erewhile, to wrest it from thy hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Haply Heaven’s vengeance ordered what befell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in that case thy wound so hindered thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the end, the cruel outrage, foul and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Done by that band before, should punished be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For after the unhappy Vestidel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-493" id="noteref-493" epub:type="noteref">493</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wearied and hurt, had sought their clemency,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among them (mostly an unchristened train)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, mid a hundred swords, unarmed, was slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To end; I say that other rage is none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which can be weighed with <em>that</em> in equal wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which kindles, when an injury is done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To kinsman, friend or lord before our eyes.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then justly in Orlando’s heart, for one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So dear to him, might sudden fury rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When him he saw, extended on the sand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slain by the stroke of fierce Gradasso’s brand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As nomade swain, who darting on its way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In slippery line the horrid snake has seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That his young son, amid the sands at play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has killed with venomed tooth, enflamed with spleen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grasps his batoon, the poisonous worm to slay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sword, than every other sword more keen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, in his fury grasped Anglantes’ knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wreaked on Agramant his first despite,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Scaped, bleeding, with helm loosened form his head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With half a shield and swordless, through his mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore wounded in more places than is said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As from the dull or envious falcon’s nail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Escapes the unhappy sparrowhawk, half dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With ruffled plumage and with loss of tail.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-494" id="noteref-494" epub:type="noteref">494</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him Orlando came and smote him just</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where with the helmed head confined the bust.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Loosed was the helm, the neck without its band:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, like a rush, was severed by the sword.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Down-fell, and shook its last upon the sand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heavy trunk of Libya’s mighty lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His spirit, which flitted to the Stygian strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charon with crooked boat-hook dragged aboard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him Orlando wastes no further pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, sword in hand, seeks him of Sericane.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As the headless trunk of Afric’s cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extended on the shore Gradasso’s viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(What never had befallen him whilere)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shook at heart, a troubled visage shewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at the coming of Anglantes’ peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Presageful of his fate, appears subdued:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-495" id="noteref-495" epub:type="noteref">495</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor seeks he means of fence against his foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When fierce Orlando deals the fatal blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando levels at his better side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the lowest rib, his faulchion bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And crimsoned to the hilt, a hand’s breadth wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the other flank, the sword appears in sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well his mighty puissance testified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spoke him as the strongest living knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That stroke, by which a warrior was undone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better than whom in Paynimry was none.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Little his victory good Orlando cheers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself he quickly from his saddle throws;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with a face disturbed, and wet with tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his Brandimart in haste the warrior goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field about him red with blood appears,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-496" id="noteref-496" epub:type="noteref">496</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His helmet cleft as by a hatchet’s blows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, had it been than spungy rind more frail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have defended him no worse than mail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando lifts the helmet, and descries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brandimart’s head by that destructive brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleft even to his nose, between the eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet so the wounded knight his spirits manned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That pardon of the king of Paradise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, before death, was able to demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to exhort to patience Brava’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose manly cheeks were wet with many a tear;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And⁠—“Roland, in thy helping orisons, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beseech thee to remember me,” he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor recommend to thee less warmly my⁠—”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-497" id="noteref-497" epub:type="noteref">497</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Flordelice would, but could not, say⁠—and died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sounds and songs of angels in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the soul parts, are heard on every side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from its prison freed, mid hymns of love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ascends into the blissful realms above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando, albeit he should joy in heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At death so holy, and is certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That called to bliss above is Brandimart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he heaven opened to the knight described;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through human wilfulness⁠—which aye takes part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With our weak senses⁠—hardly can abide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The loss of one, above a brother dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can refrain from many a scalding tear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Warlike Sobrino, of much blood bereaved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from his flank and wounded visage rained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long since had fallen, reversed and sore aggrieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had by now his vessels well nigh drained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olivier too lies stretched; nor has retrieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can retrieve, his crippled foot, save sprained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And almost crushed; so long between the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his stout courser jammed, the limb has lain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And but Orlando helped (so woe begone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was weeping Olivier, and brought so low)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not have released his limb alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when released, endures such pain, such woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The helpless warrior cannot stand upon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or shift withal his wounded foot, and so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Benumbed and crippled is the leg above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he without assistance cannot move.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The victory brought Orlando small delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom too heavily and hardly weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of slaughtered Brandimart the piteous sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sure of Oliviero’s life he made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino yet survived; but little light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wounded monarch had, amid much shade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For almost spend his ebbing life remained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fast from him the crimson blood had drained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The County has him taken, bleeding sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where he is saved with sovereign care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he as if a kinsman of the Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Benignly comforts him and speaks him fair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in Orlando, when the strife was o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was nothing evil; ever prompt to spare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the dead their arms and coursers reft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest he to their knives’ disposal left.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here as my story stood not on good ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frederick Fulgoso doubtful does appear;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-498" id="noteref-498" epub:type="noteref">498</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, searching Barbary’s every shore and sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile on board a squadron, landed here;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the isle so rugged and so rocky found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all its parts so mountainous and drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is not (through the land) a level space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He says) whereon a single boot to place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor deems he likely, that six cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wide world’s flower, on Alpine rock should vie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that equestrian fight, with levelled spears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whose objection thus I make reply:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile a place, well fit for such careers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stretched at the bottom of the hills did lie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But afterwards, o’erthrown by earthquake’s shock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cliff o’erspread the plain with broken rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So, of Fulgoso’s race thou shining ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clear, lasting light, if, questioning my word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou on this point hast ever said me nay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply too, before the unconquered lord,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-499" id="noteref-499" epub:type="noteref">499</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through whom thy land, reposing, casts away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All haste, and wholly leans to kind accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prythee delay not to declare, that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this my story haply tell no lie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile his eyes the good Orlando reared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw, on turning them to seaward, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under full sail a nimble bark appeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if she to that island would repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I will not now rehearse who thither steered;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For more than one awaiteth me elsewhere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wend me to France and see if they be glad</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At having chased the Saracens, or sad;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>See what she does withal, the lady true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That sees her knight content to wend so wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the afflicted Bradamant I shew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After she saw the oath was nullified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made in the hearing of those armies two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the Christian and the paynim side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he again had failed her, there was nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein she could confide, the damsel thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And now her too accustomed plaint and wail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repeating, of Rogero’s cruelty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair Bradamant renewed the wonted tale;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She cursed her hard and evil destiny;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then loosening to tempestuous grief the sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven that consented to such perjury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And did not yet by some plain token speak⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, in her passion, called unjust and weak.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sage Melissa she accused, and cursed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The oracle of the cavern, through whose lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in that sea of love herself immersed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon whose waters she embarked to die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to Marphisa afterwards rehearsed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her woes, and told her brother’s perfidy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She chides, pours forth her sorrows, and demands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With tears and outcries, succour at her hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa shrugs her shoulders; what alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She can, she offers⁠—comfort to the fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor thinks Rogero her has so foregone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what to her he shortly will repair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, should he not, such outrage to be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel plights her promise not to bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twixt her and him shall deadly war be waged,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or he shall keep the word, which he engaged.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She makes her somewhat thus her grief restrain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which having vent in some sort spend its gall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now we have seen the damsel in her pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero impious, proud, and perjured call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">See we, if in a happier state remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The brother of that gentle maid withal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose flesh, bones, nerves, and sinews are a prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To burning love; Rinaldo I would say.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say Rinaldo that (as known to you)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica the beauteous loved so well:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor him into the amorous fillets drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So much her beauty as the magic spell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In peace reposed those other barons true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For wholly broken was the infidel:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone amid the victors, he, of all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paladins, remained Love’s captive thrall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To seek her he a hundred couriers sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sought as well, himself, the missing maid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in the end to Malagigi went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in his need had often given him aid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him he told his love, with eyelids bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On earth, and visage crimsoned o’er; and prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That sage magicians to instruct him, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in the world might find the long-sought fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A case, so strange and wondrous, marvel sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In friendly Malagigi’s bosom bred:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wizard knew, a hundred times and more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He might have had the damsel in his bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he himself, to move the knight or yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her behalf, enough had done and said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had him by prayer and menace sought to bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet ne’er was able to obtain his end;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And so much more, that out of prison-ward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He then would Malagigi so have brought.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-500" id="noteref-500" epub:type="noteref">500</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now will he seek her, of his own accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On less occasion, when it profits nought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next that magician Montalbano’s lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mark how sorely do had erred, besought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since little lacked, but through the boon denied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile he had in gloomy dungeon died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But how much more Rinaldo’s strange demand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounded importunately in his ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So by sure index Malagigi scanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That so much was Angelica more dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo prayer unable to withstand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In ocean sunk the wizard cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All memory of old injury assayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bowned himself to give the warrior aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For his reply he craved some small delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with fair hope consoled Mount Alban’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He should be able of the road to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By which Angelica had sped her flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In France or wheresoe’er;” then wends his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither where he is wont his imps to cite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A grot impervious and with mountains walled:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His book he opened and the spirits called.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then one he chooses, in love-cases read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom Malagigi to declare requires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How good Rinaldo’s heart, before so died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was now so quickly moved by soft desires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And “of those fountains twain (the demon said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof one lights, one quenches amorous fires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how nought cures the mischief caused by one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that whose streams in counter current run;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And says; “Rinaldo, having drunk whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the love-chasing fountain’s mossy urn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Angelica, that long had wooed the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had shown himself so obstinate and stern;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, whom after his ill star did steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To drink of that which makes the bosom burn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her whom but just before he loathed above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All reason, by that draught was forced to love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Him his ill star and cruel fate conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To swallow fire and flame i’ the frozen lake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For nigh at the same time the Indian maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the other bitter stream her thirst did slake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in her bosom so all love allayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Henceforth she loathed him more than noisome snake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loved her, and such love was his, as late</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo bore her enmity and hate.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of this strange story fully certified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was Malagigi by the demon’s lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who news as well of Angelique supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How yielding up herself to a young Moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him embarking on the unstable tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had abandoned Europe’s every shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hoisting her bold canvas to the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Catalonian galley loosed for Ind.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo seeking out the sage anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For his reply⁠—“he would dissuade the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From loving more that Indian lady, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now waited on a vile barbarian wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was so distant he could ill pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he would chase the damsel on her flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who must have measured than half her way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Homeward, with young Medoro to Catày.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that bold lover no displeasure deep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The journey of Angelica would move;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet would mar or break the warrior’s sleep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To think that he again must eastward rove:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that a stripling Saracen should reap</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first fruits of that faithless lady’s love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In him such passion bred, such heart-ache sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never in his life so grieved before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No power hath he to make one sole reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His heart, his lip, is quivering with disdain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His tongue no word is able to untie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His mouth is bitter, and ’twould seem with bane.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He flung from the magician suddenly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as by fury stirred and jealous pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He after mighty plaint, and mighty woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved anew to eastern realms to go.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Licence he asks of Pepin’s royal son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the ground, “since with his courser dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Sericane is King Gradasso gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the use of gallant cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him honour moves the selfsame course to run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the end he may prevent the paynim peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From ever vaunting, that with sword or lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took him from a Paladin of France.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Charles gives him leave to go; though, far and nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him all France laments he thence should wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he in fine that prayer can ill deny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So honest seems the worthy warrior’s end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him Dudon, Guido, would accompany;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he refuses either valiant friend:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Paris he departs, and wends alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunged in his grief and heaving many a groan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ever in memory dwells the restless thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He might a thousand times have had the fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—mad and obstinate⁠—had, when besought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand times refused such beauty rare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such sweet joy was whilom set at nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such bright, such blessed moments wasted were;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now he life would gladly give away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have that damsel but for one short day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The thought will never from his mind depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How for a sorry footpage she could slight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Flinging their merit and their love apart⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The service of each former loving wight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vext by such thought, which racked and rent his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo wends towards the rising light:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He the straight road to Rhine and Basle pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he arrived in Arden’s mighty wood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When within that adventurous wood has hied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many a mile Montalban’s cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of lonely farm or lordly castle wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the rude place was roughest and most drear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sky disturbed he suddenly descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw the sun’s dimmed visage disappear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spied forth issuing from a cavern hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A monster, which a woman’s likeness wore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A thousand lidless eyes are in her head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She cannot close them, nor, I think, doth sleep:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She listens with as many ears, and spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like hair, about her forehead serpents creep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forth issued into day that figure dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From devilish darkness and the caverned deep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For tail, a fierce and bigger serpent wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About her breast, and girt the monster round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What in a thousand, thousand quests had ne’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Befall’n Rinaldo, here befell the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when he sees the horrid form appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Coming to seek him and prepared for fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feels in his inmost veins such freezing fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As haply never fell on other wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet wonted daring counterfeits and feigns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with a trembling hand the faulchion strains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monster so the fierce assault did make</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Therein her master was well descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It might be said; she shook a poisonous snake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now on this, now on the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leapt at the knight; at her Rinaldo strake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever meanwhile with random blows and wide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With forestroke, backstroke, he assails the foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He often smites, but never plants a blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monster threw a serpent at his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That froze his heart beneath its iron case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now through the vizor flung the poisonous pest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which crept about his collar and his face.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dismayed, Rinaldo fled the field, and prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all his spurs his courser through the chase:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not behind the hellish monster halts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in a thought upon the crupper vaults.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wend where the warrior will, an-end or wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever with him is that accursed Pest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor knows he how from her to be untied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit his courser plunges without rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like a leaf quakes his heart within his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that the snakes in other mode molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But they such horror and such loathing bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shrieks, he groans, and gladly would be dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By gloomiest track and blindest path he still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threaded the tangled forest here and there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By thorniest valley and by roughest hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wheresoever darkest was the air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus hoping to have rid him of that ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hideous, abominable, poisonous Care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath whose gripe he foully might have fared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that one quickly to his aid repaired.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But aid, and in good time, a horseman bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equipt with arms of beauteous steel and clear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For crest, a broken yoke the stranger wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Red flames upon his yellow shield appear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was the courser’s housing broidered o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the proud surcoat of the cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lance he grasped, his sword was in its place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at his saddle hung a burning mace.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That warrior’s mace a fire eternal fills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose lasting fuel ever blazes bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goodly buckler, tempered corslet thrills,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And solid helm; then needs the approaching knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must make him way, wherever ’tis his will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To turn his inextinguishable light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor of less help in need Rinaldo stands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To save him from the cruel monster’s hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The stranger horseman, like a warrior bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he that hubbub hears, doth thither swoop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he sees the beast, whose snakes enfold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, linked in many a loathsome loop,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sweats at once with heat and quakes with cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can he thrust the monster from his croup.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived the stranger smote her in the flank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on the near side of the courser sank:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But scarcely was on earth extended, ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She rose and shook her snakes in volumed spire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight no more assails her with the spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But is resolved to plague the foe with fire:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gripes the mace and thunders in her rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With frequent blows, like tempest in its ire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor leaves a moment to that monster fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To strike one stroke in answer, ill or well;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, while he chases her or holds at bay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smites her and venges many a foul affront,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Counsels the paladin, without delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take the road which scales the neighbouring mount:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He took that proffered counsel and that way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And without stop, or turning back his front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pricked furiously till he was out of sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though hard to clamber was the rugged height.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The stranger, when he to her dark retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had driven from upper light that beast of hell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Where she herself doth ever gnaw and eat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While from her thousand eyes tears ceaseless well)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed the knight, to guide his wandering feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And overtook him on the highest swell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then placed himself beside the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him from those dark and gloomy parts to steer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When him returned beheld Montalban’s knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That countless thanks were due to him,” he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And that at all times, as a debt of right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His life should be for his advantage paid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him he next demands, how he is hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he may know and tell who brought him aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And among worthy warriors, and before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Charles, exalt his prowess evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The stranger answered; “Let it irk not thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I not now my name to thee display;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere longer by a yard the shadows be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This will I signify; a short delay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wending together, they a river see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose murmurs woo the traveller from his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And shepherd-swain, by whiles, to their green brink;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There an oblivion of their love to drink.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My lord, that fountain’s chilling stream and clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguished love; Angelica of yore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drinking thereof, for good Montalban’s peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conceived that hate she nourished evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if she once displeased the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he to her such passing hatred bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this no other cause occasion gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My lord, save drinking of this chilly wave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Arriving at that limpid river’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier that with Rinaldo goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reined-in his courser, how with toil, and cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Here ’twere not ill, meseemeth, to repose.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“It cannot but be well” (the peer replied),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Because, beside that mid-day fiercely glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have so suffered from that hideous Pest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As sweet and needful shall I welcome rest.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the green sward lit the martial two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While their loose horses through the forest fed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from their brows the burnished helmets threw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On that flowered herbage, yellow, green, and red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo to the liquid crystal flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By heat and thirst unto the river sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with one draught of that cold liquor drove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of his burning bosom thirst and love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whenas Rinaldo, sated with the draught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raising his head the stranger knight espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw that he, repentant, every thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that so frantic love had put aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He reared himself, and said with semblance haught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That which he would not say before, and cried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Rinaldo, know that I am hight Disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bound hither but to break thy worthless chain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, suddenly he passed from sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him his horse: this in Rinaldo bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much wonderment; and the astonished knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Where is he?” gazing round about him, said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cannot guess if ’twere a magic sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fiend by Malagigi thither sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From those his ministers, to break the chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fettered whereby he lived so long in pain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of if an angel from the heavenly sphere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his ineffable goodness by the Lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispatched, as to Tobias’s aid whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A medicine for his blindness to afford.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But good or evil angel⁠—whatsoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was that him to liberty restored⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him thanked and praised Rinaldo, for a heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Healed only by his help of amorous smart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Old hate revived upon Rinaldo’s side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor he alone unworthy to be wooed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel deemed by pilgrimage so wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her half a league he would not have pursued.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nathless anew Bayardo to bestride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Sericane would go that warrior good:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well because his honour him compelled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As for the talk which he with Charles had held.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He pricked to Basle upon the following day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither the tidings had arrived before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That Count Orlando was, in martial fray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To meet Gradasso and the royal Moor:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor through Orlando was divulged that say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But one, who crost from the Sicilian shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither had, in haste, the journey made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As certain news, the tidings had conveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo had gladly been at Roland’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from that battle far himself doth see:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Every ten miles he changes horse and guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whips and spurs, and makes his courser flee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He crost the Rhine at Constance, forward hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He traversed Alp, arrived in Italy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He left Verona, Mantua, in his rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reached and past the Po, with swift career.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much towards eve already sloped the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the first star was glimmering in the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, doubting on the bank if he shall run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another course, or in some hostel lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the shades of night and vapours dun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before Aurora’s beauteous visage fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cavalier approaching him he viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who courtesy in face and semblance shewed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, after greeting him, “if he were tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In wedlock,” made in gentle wise demand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, wondering what the quest implied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made answer; “I am bound in nuptial band.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“I joy thereat,” the cavalier replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, that he might this saying understand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Added, “I pray that you, sir knight, within</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My mansion will this eve be pleased to inn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For I will make you see what must please</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wight” (pursued the stranger) “that is wed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, as well that he would take his ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—But this, with so long posting sore bested⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that to see and hear strange novelties</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By natural desire he still was led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His offer takes, and enters a new road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Following that cavalier to his abode.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A bowshot from the way diverged the two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a great palace fronting them descried:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence squires with blazing lights (a numerous crew)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issued, and chased the darkness far and wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entering, his eyes around Rinaldo threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw a place, whose like is seldom spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of beauteous fabric, and well ordered plan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor such huge cost befitted private man.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of serpentine and of hard porphyry are</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stones which form the gateway’s arch above.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of bronze the portal leaves, which figures bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose lively features seem to breathe and move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the vaulted entry, colours rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cheating the eye, in mixt mosaic strove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The quadrangle within was galleried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of a hundred yards, on every side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A gateway is there to each galleried row,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ’twixt it and that gate, an arch is bent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of equal breadth, but different in their show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the architect had spared not ornament.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each arch an entrance was; up which might go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A laden horse; so easy the ascent.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-501" id="noteref-501" epub:type="noteref">501</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To arch above leads every stair withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every arch is entrance to a hall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above, project the arches in such sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They for the spacious portals form a shade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And each two pillars has for its support:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of bronze are some, and some of marble made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ornamented chambers of the court</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too many are to be at length displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With easements, which (beside what is in sight)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The skilful master underground had dight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Tall columns, with their capitals of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which gemmed entablatures support in air;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exotic marbles which adorn that hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By skilfull hand engraved with figures fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Picture and cast, and works so manifold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit by night they mostly hidden were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Showed that two kings’ united treasure ne’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have sufficed such gorgeous pile to rear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above the beauteous ornaments and rich</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That mingled in that gay quadrangle meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is a fresh and plenteous fountain, which</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatters in many threads its watery sheet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis here that youths at equal distance pitch,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the middle, tables for the festive treat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence they four gates of that rich mansion see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seen from those four gates as well may be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By cunning master, diligent and wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With much and subtle toil, the fount was made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In open gallery or pavilion’s guise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from eight separate fronts, projects a shade.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A gilded roof, which with enamelled dyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was stained below, the building overlayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eight marble statues (snowy was the grain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the left arm that gilded roof sustain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fair Amalthaea’s horn in the right hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had quaintly sculptured the ingenious master,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence water, trickling forth with murmur bland,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descends into a vase of alabaster;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, in likeness of a lady grand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sovereign art had fashioned each pilaster.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Various they were in visage and in vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all of equal charms and grace possest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon two beauteous images below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each of these female statues fix their feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lower seem with open mouth to show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That song and harmony to them are sweet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, by their attitude, ’twould seem, as though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their every work and every study meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In praising them, they on their shoulders bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they would those whose likenesses they wear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The images below them in their hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long scrolls and of an ample size contain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of the worthiest figures of that band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The several names with mickle praise explain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well their own at little distance stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inscribed upon that scroll, in letters plain,</span>
				<br/>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof so speaks the writing on the stone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Her consort Beatrice, while she has breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blesses, and leaves unhappy at her death;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yea, Italy; that with her triumphs bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without that lady fair shall captive be.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lofty song appears of her to indite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lord of the Correggio’s noble tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, Benedèo’s pride, Timotheus hight.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-519" id="noteref-519" epub:type="noteref">519</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between his banks, descending to the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By their joint music shall the stream be stopt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose trees erewhile the liquid amber dropt.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-520" id="noteref-520" epub:type="noteref">520</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Between this and that lofty column’s place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into fair Borgia fashioned (as was said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of aspect so distinguished, of such grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lady was, of alabaster made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, hiding in a simple veil her face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sable, without gems or gold arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, ’mid the brightest, flung her light as far,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As amid lesser fires the Cyprian star.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None knows, observing her with steadfast view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she of charms or grace have fuller store,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether her visage most majestic shew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or beam with genius or with beauty more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He that would speak⁠—would speak her praises true⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Declares in fine the sculptured marble’s lore)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fairest of emprizes would intend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But never bring his noble task to end.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Albeit such grace and passing sweetness shewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her fair and well-wrought image, she disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared to nurse, that one of wit so rude</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should dare to sing her praise in humble strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he that only without comrade stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not why, her statue to sustain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The marble all those other names revealed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That pair’s alone the artist had concealed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-521" id="noteref-521" epub:type="noteref">521</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The statues in the middle form a round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The floor whereof dry stalks of coral pave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Most pleasant, cool, and grateful, is that ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So rendered by the pure and crystal wave.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which vent without in other channel found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issued forth in many a stream, to lave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mead of azure, white, and yellow hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gladdening the plants that on their margins grew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Conversing with his courteous host, the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sate at the board, and oft and often prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That without more delay the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would keep the promise he whilere had made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And marking, ever and anon, his cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Observes his heart with some deep woe downweighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For not a moment ’mid their converse slips,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what a burning sigh is on his lips.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oft with desire was good Rinaldo stung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To ask that sorrow’s cause, and the request</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was almost on the gentle warrior’s tongue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there by courteous modesty represt.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now at their banquet’s close a youth, among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The menial crew, on whom that charge did rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Placed a gold cup before the paladin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Filled full of gems without, of wine within.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The host then somedeal smiling, from the board</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Looked up at Aymon’s son; but who this while</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well marked him, as he eyed Montalban’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had deemed him more disposed to weep than smile.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“So oft reminded, to maintain my word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis time meseems (said he, that owned the pile)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shew the touchstone for a woman’s love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which needs to wedded man must welcome prove.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ne’er, in my judgment, should the married dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be from espial by her lord released:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus shall he know if honour or if blame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His portion is; if he is man or beast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weight of horns, though coupled with such shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is of all burdens upon the earth the least.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While well-nigh all behold his antlers spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He feels them not who has them on his head.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If certain of thy wife’s fidelity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou hast more ground to prize and hold her dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than one, whose wife is evil known to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or husband that is still in doubt and fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Full many husbands live in jealousy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And groundlessly, of women chaste and clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On many women many men rely</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, who bear their branching antlers high.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If thou wouldst be assured thy wife is true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As sure methinks thou thinkest and must think)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For it is hard that notion to undo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless thy trust before sure tokens sink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—No hearsay matter this⁠—thyself shalt view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The truth, if thou in this fair vessel drink,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-522" id="noteref-522" epub:type="noteref">522</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Placed solely on the supper-board, that thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May’st see the marvel promised thee but now.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Drink, and a mighty marvel shall be seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if thou wearest Cornwall’s lofty crest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-523" id="noteref-523" epub:type="noteref">523</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No drop of wine shall pass thy lips between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the draught be spilt upon thy breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If faithful is thy wife, thou shalt drink clean.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now⁠—to try thy fortune⁠—to the test!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He said, and with fixt eyes the sign explored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If on his breast the wine Rinaldo poured.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo was nigh moved the cup to raise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seek what he would haply wish unsought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forward he reached his hand and took the vase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About to prove his fortune in the draught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then of the passing peril of the case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before it touched his lips, the warrior thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let me, sir, repose myself, and I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will then relate the Paladin’s reply.</span>

				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>Rinaldo from his courteous landlord hears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What folly had destroyed his every good;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Next learns another story, as he steers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Toward Ravenna with the falling flood:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then last arrives where, conqueror o’er his foes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Orlando was, but in no joyful mood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, that the Child a Christian made whilere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Christens Sobrino, and heals Olivier.</span>

			<p>
				<span>O execrable avarice! O vile thirst</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sordid gold! it doth not me astound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So easily thou seizest soul, immersed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In baseness, or with other taint unsound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that thy chain should bind, amid the worst,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that thy talon should strike down and wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that for loftiness of mind would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy all praise, if he avoided thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some earth and sea and heaven above us square,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know Nature’s causes, works, and properties;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What her beginnings, what her endings are;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And soar till Heaven is open to their eyes:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet have no steadier aim, no better care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stung by thy venom, than, in sordid wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To gather treasure: such their single scope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their every comfort, and their every hope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Armies by him are broken in his pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gates of warlike towns in triumph past:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foremost he to breast the furious tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fearful battle; to retire the last;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet cannot save himself from being stied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till death, in thy dark dungeon prisoned fast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of others that would shine thou dimm’st the praise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom other studies, other arts would raise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What shall of high and beauteous dames be said?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who (from their lovers’ worth and charms secure)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against long service, I behold, more staid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More motionless, than marble shafts, endure:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then Avarice comes, who so her spells hath laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I see them stoop directly to her lure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Who could believe?⁠—unloving, in a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They fall some elder’s, fall some monster’s prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not without reason here I raise this cry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Read me who can, I read myself⁠—nor so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I from the beaten pathway tread awry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thus the matter of my song forego.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not more to what is shown do I apply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My saying, than to what I have to show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now return we to the paladine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was about to taste the enchanted wine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Fain would he think awhile, of whom I speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As said) ere to his lips the vase he bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thought; then thus: “When finding what we seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Displeases, this ’tis folly to explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My wife’s a woman; every woman’s weak.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then let me hold the faith I held before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faith still has brought, and yet contentment brings.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From proof itself what better profit springs?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“From this small good, much evil I foresee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For tempting God moves sometimes his disdain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not if it wise or foolish be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to know more than needs, I am not fain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now put away the enchanted cup from me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I neither will, nor would, the goblet drain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which is with Heaven’s command as much at strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Adam’s deed who robbed the tree of life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For as our sire who tasted of that tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And God’s own word, by eating, disobeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell into sorrow from felicity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was by misery evermore o’erlaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The husband so, that all would know and see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever by his wife is done and said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passes from happiness to grief and pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever can uplift his head again.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the good Rinaldo saying so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pushing from himself the cup abhorred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld of tears a plenteous fountain flow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the full eyes of that fair mansion’s lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cried, now having somewhat calmed his woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Accursed be he, persuaded by whose word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! I of the fortune made assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereby my cherished wife was reft away!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wherefore ten years ago wast thou not known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that I counselled might have been of thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the sorrows and the grief begun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That have nigh quenched my eyes; but raised shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The curtain from the scene, that thou upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My pain mayst look, and mayst lament with me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I to thee of mine unheard-of woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The argument and very head will show.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Above, was left a neighbouring city, pent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within a limpid stream that forms a lake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which widens, and wherein Po finds a vent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their way the waters from Benacus take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Built was the city, when to ruin went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Walls founded by the Agenorean snake.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-524" id="noteref-524" epub:type="noteref">524</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here me of gentle line my mother bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But of small means, in humble home and poor.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If Fortune’s care I was not, who denied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me upon my birth a wealthy boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nature that went with graceful form supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that in beauty rival had I none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enamoured of me in youth’s early tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile was dame and damsel more than one:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I with beauty coupled winning ways;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though it becomes not man himself to praise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A sage within our city dwelled, a wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond belief, in every science great;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when he closed his eyes on Phoebus’ light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Numbered one hundred years, one score and eight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A savage life he led and out of sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until impelled by love, the senior late</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By dint of gifts obtained a matron fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who secretly to him a daughter bare;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And to prevent the child from being won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As was erewhile the mother, that for gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bartered her chastity, whose worth alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excels what gold earth’s ample veins contain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With her he from the ways of man is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where he spies the loneliest place, his train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of demons forces, in enchantment skilled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This dome so spacious, fair, and rich, to build.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“By ancient and chaste dames he there made rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This daughter, that in sovereign beauty grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor suffered her to see or even hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A man beside himself; and, for her view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Lest lights should lack, whereby her course to steer⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The senior every modest lady, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">E’er on unlawful love the barrier shut,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made limn in picture, or in sculpture cut.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor he alone those virtuous dames, who, sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chaste, had so adorned antiquity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose fame, preserved by the historic page,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is never doomed its dying day to see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But those as well that will in future age</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Everywhere beautify fair Italy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made fashion in their well-known form and mien;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As eight that round this fount by thee are seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What time the damsel ripe for husband shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the fruit may now be gathered, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Did chance or my misfortune so dispose?)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am worthiest found; and those broad lands that lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without the walls which that fair town enclose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The fishy flat no less than upland dry⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extending twenty miles about that water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gives me for a dowry, with his daughter.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She was so mannered, was so fair of hue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None could desire she other gifts should bring;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So well to broider was she taught, and sew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Minerva knew not better; did she sing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or play, or walk, to those that hear and view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seems a heavenly, and no mortal thing;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the liberal arts was skilled as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As her own sire, or scarce behind him fell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With genius high and beauty no less bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which might have served the very stones to move,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such love, such sweetness did the maid unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinking thereof meseems my heart is clove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had no greater pleasure or delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than being with me, did I rest or rove.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas long ere we had any strife; in fine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We quarrelled; and the fault, alas! was mine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Five years my consort’s father had been dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since to that yoke I stooped, and pledged my vow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in short time (the manner shall be said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Began the sorrows that I feel even now.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While me with all his pinions overspread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love of the dame, whose praises thus I blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A noble townswoman with love of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was smit; more sorely smitten none could be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She, in all magic versed, was of such skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As never was enchantress; by her say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved solid earth, and made the sun stand still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Illumined gloomy night and darkened day:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet never could she work upon my will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The anguish of her amorous wound to allay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With salve I could not give, except with scathe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her to whom erewhile I pledged my faith.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not because she right gentle was and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor because I believed her love so true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for large gift, nor promise often plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet because she never ceased to sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could she from me obtain one spark of light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that first flame my gentle consort blew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So mates and masters every will in me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knowledge of my wife’s fidelity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I in the hope, belief, and certitude</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My wife to me was faithful evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should with contempt the beauty have eschewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that famed daughter which fair Leda bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all the wit and wealth wherewith was wooed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The illustrious shepherd upon Ida hoar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But no repulse withal with her avails,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who me, for ever at my side, assails.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“One day that me beyond my palace sees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That weird enchantress, who Melissa hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where she can discourse with me at ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She finds a way whereby my peace to blight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, goading me with evil jealousies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faith I nursed at heart, she puts to flight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She ’gan commending my intent to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faithful to her who faithful was to me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘But that she faithful is, ye cannot say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save of her faith ye have assurance true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she fails not withal, where fail she may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She faithful, modest may be deemed by you:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But is she never from your side away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is not permitted other man to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How does this boldness come, that you would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrant of her untried modesty?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Go forth awhile; go forth come from home alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be the bruit in town and village spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she remains behind, and you are gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let lovers and let couriers have their head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If, unpersuaded still by prayer and boon,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She does no outrage to the marriage bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though doing so she deem herself unseen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then faithful you the dame may justly ween.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I with such words and suchlike words was plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till so on me the shrewd enchantress wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I wished to see my consort’s virtue tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By certain proof, and to the touchstone brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘Now grant we (I to that witch-lady cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She prove what cannot by myself be thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How by some certain token can I read</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she will merit punishment or meed?’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘A drinking-cup will I for that assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give you (she said) of virtue strange and rare:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such was for Arthur made by Morgue the fay,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-525" id="noteref-525" epub:type="noteref">525</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make him of Genevra’s fault aware.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The chaste wife’s lord thereof may drink; but they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drink not, whose wedded partners wanton are:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, when they would the cordial beverage sup,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into their bosom overflows the cup.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Below departing, you the test shall try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to my thinking, now shall you drink clean;</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The event however shall by you be seen.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet will I warrant not your bosom dry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should you repeat the proof; for if, between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cup and lip, the liquor be not shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You are the happiest wight that ever wed.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The offer I accept, the vase to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is given, and trial made with full success;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For hitherto (as hoped) confirmed I see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My gentle consort’s worth and faithfulness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Leave her awhile (Melissa said), and be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A month or twain a truant, more or less:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then homeward wend; again the goblet fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And prove if you the beverage drink or spill.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I thought it hard to leave my consort’s side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not as so much about her truth in pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that I could nor for two days abide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, not an hour without her could remain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘⁠—You in another way (Melissa cried)</span>

				<span>“Sir, a fair city nigh at hand, defends</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, following a lost falcon in its flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Entering by chance my dwelling on a day,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But her fair image graved by Love will ne’er</span>

				<span class="i1">The face and figure to the sight to don;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And changed me⁠—nor well how can I declare⁠—</span>

				<span class="i1">In voice and visage and in eyes and hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I, having to my lady made a show</span>

				<span class="i1">As eastward bound and gone⁠—like him that wooed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her rich and youthful lover, altered so,</span>

				<span class="i1">So wholly at her ease Madonna view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No woman or attendant squire is by.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her with suppliant prayer forthwith I sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next those goads to evil deed apply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Show emerald, ruby, diamond, that might serve</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make the firmest heart from honour swerve;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I declare to her the gift is small</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that, which she may hope to make her own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then of the vantage speak, that from his hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her husband at the present time is gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I how long it was to her recall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, as she knew, to her my love was shown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that my loving with such faith, in the end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might worthily to some reward pretend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“At first she was somedeal disturbed; became</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like scarlet; nor would listen to my say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But seeing those bright jewels flash like flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her stubborn heart was softened, and gave way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in brief speech and feeble said the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What to remember takes my life away:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘She with my wishes, said, she would comply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If sure to be unseen of watchful eye.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Me my wife’s words like poisoned weapon thrill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pierce my suffering spirit through and through:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through bones and veins there went a deadly chill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My tongue clave to my throat: The witch withdrew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that the magic mantle, and at will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Transformed me to mine ancient shape anew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Bethink thee of what hue my wife became,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taken by me in such notorious shame!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of deadly hue we both of us remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We both stand silent; both with downcast eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So feeble is my tongue, that I with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So faint my voice, that I with pain can cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Thou wouldst betray me then, O wife, for gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If there was one that would my honour buy!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She nought replies; nor save by tears she speaks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which furrow, as they fall, her woeful cheeks.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Shame stings her sore, but yet in sorer wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wrath at the outrage I to her had done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so without restraint it multiplies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And into rage and cruel hate is run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fly from me forthwith does she devise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, what time from his car dismounts the sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Runs to the shore, aboard her pinnace wends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all that night the stream in haste descends;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And she at morn presents herself before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him that had loved her once, the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose semblance and whose borrowed face I wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, to my shame, I tempted her whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him that loved, and loves her evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her coming, it may be believed, is dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence she bade me never entertain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hope she’d love me or be mine again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas! with him she swells in mickle glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even from that day, and makes of me a jest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of that evil which I brought on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I languish yet, and find no place of rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Justly this growing ill my death will be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of little remnant now of life possest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I well believe I in a year had died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that a single comfort aid supplied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That comfort was; of all which harboured were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here for ten years (for still to every guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath my roof I bade the vessel bear)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was none but with the wine had bathed his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have so many comrades in my care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some little soothes the griefs that so molest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou only of so many hast been wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who wouldst forbear the perilous emprize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My wish, o’erpassing every fitting bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To know what husband of his wife should know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is cause, by me no quiet will be found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether my death be speedy of be slow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thereat at first Melissa joys; but drowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith is her light mirth; for of my woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteeming her the cause, that dame so sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hated, I would not behold her more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Impatient to be treated with disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By me⁠—of her more loved than life, she said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she forthwith as mistress to remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had hoped, when thence the other was conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Not to behold such present, cause of pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her own departure little she delayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And went so far away, no further word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By me was ever of that woman heard.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His tale the mournful cavalier so taught;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when he now had closed his history,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pity touched, somewhile immersed in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo mused, and after made reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Right ill advice to thee Melissa brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who moved three thus to anger wasps; and I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perceive in thee small wisdom, that wouldst sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thing which thou wouldst gladly not have found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If she, thy wife, by avarice was inclined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To break her faith and be to thee untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Muse not: nor first nor last of womankind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, worsted, from such cruel war withdrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by a meaner bribe yet firmer mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is even tempted fouler deed to do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of men, of how many we hear, that sold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their patrons and their friends for sordid gold?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With such fierce arms thou ill didst her assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If to behold a brave defence thou sought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knowst thou not, against gold of no avail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is stone, or steel to hardest temper wrought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseems that thou in tempting her didst fail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than herself, that was so quickly caught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not, had she tempted thee as much,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou, thyself, hadst better stood the touch.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here ends Rinaldo, and⁠—the parley done⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rises and to his rest desires to go:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Awhile will he repose; and then be gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An hour or two before the daylight show.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But little time has Aymon’s warlike son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor idly will that little time bestow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the mansion’s master made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He in his house might at his pleasure lie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For bed and bower, within, were ready dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But⁠—would he take his counsel for his guide⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In comfort might he sleep throughout the night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet advance some miles; ‘For thou,’ he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Shalt have a pinnace, that with rapid flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And without risk shall with the current glide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Therein shalt thou all night pursue thy way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on thy journey gain withal a day.’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Good seemed that proffer in Rinaldo’s eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the courteous host large thanks he paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then for the pinnace which that lord supplies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That waits him with her crew, the warrior made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here, at full ease reclined, Rinaldo lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with the stream his frigate is conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, by six oars impelled, flies fast and fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cleaves the water, as a bird the air.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As soon as he reclines his weary head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Asleep is Mount Albano’s cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having erewhile “that they shall wake him,” said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“As soon as they Ferrara’s city near.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melara lies left of that river’s bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sermide to the right; they in their rear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next leave Stellata and Figarolo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where his two horns are lowered by angry Po.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of those two horns <em>that</em> which t’ward Venice goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo’s pilot left, and took the right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then the Bodeno past. Already shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faintly the eastern blue, and fades from sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For now Aurora from her basket throws</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All her rich flowers, and paints it red and white;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When viewing the two castles of Tealdo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Again his head uplifts the good Rinaldo.</span>

				<span>“O happy town! whereof” (the warrior cried)</span>

				<span class="i1">The fixt and wandering fires of heaven espied,</span>

				<span class="i1">And forced some subject spirit to appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me foretelling that in future tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—What time with him I took his way whilere⁠—</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So saying, in his barge he all this while</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurries, as if the bark with pinions flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scouring the king of rivers, to that isle</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nearest the town;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-527" id="noteref-527" epub:type="noteref">527</a> and, though it not to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Deserted and neglected then) doth smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This yet rejoices to behold anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor makes small mirth thereat; because aware</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hereafter how adorned ’twill be and fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Before when he with him that way had gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Malagigi, his cousin, did he hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That when seven hundred times his course had run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Circling the heaven in Aries, the fourth sphere,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-528" id="noteref-528" epub:type="noteref">528</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of islands this should be the fairest one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sea, or pool, or river, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that who this beheld, would brook no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear <em>that</em> praised which fair Nausicäa bore.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-529" id="noteref-529" epub:type="noteref">529</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He heard, “it in fair mansions would outdo</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That island which Tiberius held so dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And trees that in Hesperian gardens grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would yield to what this beauteous place should bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—So rare its race of beasts⁠—no fairer shew</span>

				<span class="i1">Nor more in Gnide and Cyprus keep her court;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And so would flourish through his study and care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will with knowledge and with power should blend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who so safely should that bright repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With circling wall and sheltering dyke defend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The united world’s assault it well might dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor call on foreign power its aid to lend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that Duke Hercules’ sire and Hercules’ son<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-530" id="noteref-530" epub:type="noteref">530</a></span>

				<span class="i1">Was he by whom this marvel should be done.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So wends the warrior summing in his mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What erst to him had told his cousin wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the sage of future things divined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereof with him he often wont devise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And aye contemplating that city blind,</span>

				<span class="i1">“How can it ever be,” Rinaldo cries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That in all liberal and all worthy arts</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Henceforth should full and fruitful harvests glow?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even now I rise, to hail the gentle blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The love, the courtesy thy lords shall show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O thou fair city, in succeeding years;</span>

				<span>“The grace ineffable of powers above,</span>

				<span>While thus Rinaldo speaks, so swiftly borne</span>

				<span>Montalban’s martial lord (as it befell,</span>

				<span class="i1">That thought moved thought, which others moved again)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In memory chances on the knight to dwell,</span>

				<span class="i1">Who of his goblet drank, there was no wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But split the wine he to his lips would guide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now he repents him; now, “ ’Tis my delight,”</span>

				<span>“This my belief I deem a certainty;</span>

			<p>
				<span>The knight of Clermont buried in this mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who lifted not his visage from the floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mariner with much attention viewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That overright was seated at his oar:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for he deemed he fully understood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thought that prest the cavalier so sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made him (well-spoken was the man and bold)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wake from his muse, some talk with him to hold.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The substance of the talk between the two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was, “that the husband little wit possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, wishing to assay if she was true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had tried his wife by too severe a test:</span>

				<span class="i1">For woman, proof to gold and silver, who,</span>

				<span class="i1">Armed but with modesty, defends her breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This from a thousand faulchions will defend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More surely, and through burning fires will wend.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The mariner subjoined; “Thou saidest well;</span>

				<span class="i1">With gifts so rich he should not her have prest;</span>

				<span>The boatman then; “Erewhile was of this town</span>

				<span class="i1">Studying his Ulpian: he of honest fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beauty, and state assorting with his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A consort sought, and one of noble name:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor vainly; in a neighbouring city, crowned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With superhuman beauty, one he found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She such fair manners and so graceful shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She seems all love and beauty; and much more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perchance than maketh for her lord’s repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then well befits the reverend charge he bore.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All jealous men that ever were before:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet she affords not other cause for care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that she is too witty and too fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“In the same city dwelt a cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Numbered that old and honoured race among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sprung from the haughty lineage, which whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of the jaw-bone of a serpent sprung:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence Manto,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-531" id="noteref-531" epub:type="noteref">531</a> doomed my native walls to rear,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier (Adonio was he named)</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And for the furtherance of his amorous quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grace himself, began his wealth to spend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without restraint, in banquet and in vest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what might most a cavalier commend:</span>

				<span class="i1">He of his riches would have made an end.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I well believe two winters were not done,</span>

				<span class="i1">Of that once noble troop upon the lord,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile from serpent’s teeth by Cadmus sown;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And by the churl the offended knight so said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And did withal, he made him quit the emprize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving the hunted serpent neither dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor injured, nor pursued in further wise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither, where he believes would least have spread</span>

				<span class="i1">From falling into such an evil deed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For man, alas, will sometimes disarray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The altar, when he finds himself in need,</span>

				<span class="i1">What gold and gems the judge had put away,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rents, fruits, and all possessions whatsoe’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaves to his consort; all his worldly gear:</span>

				<span class="i1">Took leave, and on his road in earnest prest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And truly felt, on wheeling round his steed,</span>

				<span class="i1">Into a dog she changed herself to sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The smallest ever seen, of aspect sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long hair, than ermine’s fur more snowy white;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And skilled withal in many a wondrous feat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards Argìa’s villa, so transmewed,</span>
				<br/>

				<span>“And at the labourer’s cabins in his round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling halts, before he stops elsewhere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And certain rustic reeds begins to sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His dog is up, and dances to the air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dame, that hears the voice and cry rebound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is by the rumour moved to see the pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into her court she has the pilgrim brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Anselm’s evil destiny had wrought:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And here Adonio gives the dog command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here by that obedient dog is shown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dance of our country and of foreign land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With paces, graces, fashions of his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finally he does, amid that band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With winning ways what else is to be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such attention of the admiring crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None winked their eyes, their breath they scarcely drew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Great marvel in the dame, then longing, bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gentle dog: she one that her had nursed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With no mean offer to his master sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—‘If all the riches for which women thirst’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(To her embassadress in answer said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wary pilgrim) ‘in my bags were pursed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There is not in that treasure what would boot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To purchase of my dog one single foot;’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And he, the truth of his discourse to show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into a corner took the beldam old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade the dog in courtesy bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that messanger a mark of gold.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dog obeyed, and shook himself; and lo!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The treasure! which he bade her have and hold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thereto he added, ‘Thinkest thou by ought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A dog so fair and useful can be bought?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘For whatsoever I of him demand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I empty-handed never go away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now pearl, now ring will he shake from him, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now gift me with some rich and fair array.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet tell madonna he is at her command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not for gold; for him no gold can pay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But if I for one night her arms may fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him may she take and do with him her will.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So said, a gem, new-dropt, on her he prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade her to the lady bear the boon.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in the costly produce she possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ten, twenty ducats’ value deemed the crone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She bore the message to the dame addressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after wrought on her till she was won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To buy the beauteous dog, ‘who might be bought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By payment of a prize which costeth nought.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Argìa somewhat coy at first appears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Partly that she her faith will not forego;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Partly that she believes not all she hears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That beldam of the dog and pilgrim show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The nurse insists, and dins into her ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘That seldom such a chance occurs below;’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes her fix another day to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That dog, when fewer eyes on her shall be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The next appearance which Adonio made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ruin to the doctor; for the hound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doubloons, by dozens and by dozens, braid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of pearl, and costly jewels scattered round.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that Argìa’s pride of heart was laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so much less the dame maintained her ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she in him, who made the proffer, viewed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Mantuan cavalier that whilom wooed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The harlot nurse’s evil oratory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prayer and presence of the suitor lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The occasion to acquire that mighty fee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which wretched Anselm’s absence would afford,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hope that none would her accuser be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vanquish her chaste thoughts, she makes the accord⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accepts the wondrous dog; and, as his pay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her leman yields herself a willing prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fruits of love long culled that cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his lady fair; unto whom the fay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took such affection, whom she held so dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she obliged herself with her to stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through all the signs the sun had travelled, ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The judge had leave to wend his homeward way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He finally returned; but sore afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through what the astrologer erewhile had said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Arrived, his first employment is to run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that astrologer’s abode, and crave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If shame and evil to his wife be done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Of if she yet her faith and honor save.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heavens he figured; and to every one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the seven planets its due station gave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then to the judge replied ‘that it had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even as he feared, and as it was foreseen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘By richest presents tempted to forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her faith, a prey was she to other wight.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This to the doctor’s heart was such a blow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lance, nor spear, I deem, so sorely smite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be more certified he wends (although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is too well assured the seer is right)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that old nurse; and, drawing her apart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To learn the truth employs his every art.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He in wide circles doth about her wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping now here, now there, to spy some trace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But nought in the beginning can he find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whatsoever care he sifts the case.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she, as not unpractised in that kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Denies, and fronts him with untroubled face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as well taught, above a month stands out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Holding the judge ’twixt certainty and doubt.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How blest would doubt appear, had he that wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foreseen, which would be given by certainty!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When out of that false nurse at last he found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not fish the truth by prayer or fee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touching no chord but yielded a false sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He shrewdly waits his time till there should be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discord between the beldam and his wife:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For whereso women are, is stir and strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And even that Anselmo waited, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Befell; since, angered by the first despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unsought of him, to him that nurse did go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell the whole; and nothing hid from sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How sank his heart beneath that cruel blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twere long to say; how prostrate lay his sprite.</span>

				<span class="i1">His rage, but first would kill the faithless dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he with one destructive faulchion yearned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To free himself from woe and her from shame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stung by such blind and furious thoughts, returned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anselmo to the city, in a flame;</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence without waiting escort⁠—would she show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her love⁠—she with his man must backward wend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Wend with him will she surely, nor delay)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bids him cut her throat upon the way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The serving-man to call his lady went</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having her little dog at starting hent,</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">And through bye-roads and solitary goes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Purposely lighting on a stream, whose tide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Apennine into our river flows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, both of farm and busy city wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A holt, and dark and dismal greenwood grows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Silent appeared the gloomy place, and one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fitting the cruel deed which should be done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He drew his sword on her, and signified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mandate by her angry husband given;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That so she might entreat, before she died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forgiveness of her every sin from Heaven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not how; she vanished from his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When through her flank the blade he would have driven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vainly long time he seeks her, then remains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Foiled and outscorned, for guerdon of his pains.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He all astound and with bewildered face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And full of shame, to seek his lord returns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from the servant that unwonted case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unweeting how the thing had happened, learns;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor knows the fairy Manto fills a place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About Argìa, prompt to serve her turns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the nurse, that all the rest revealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I know not wherefore, I), had this concealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He knows not what to do: the outrage sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Avenged he has not, nor his pain allaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What was a mote is now a beam; so sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It prest him; on his heart so heavy weighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So plain is what was little known before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fears that it will shortly be displaid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At first, he haply might have hid his woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Rumour now throughout the world will blow.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Full well he wots, that since his evil vein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to his wife, unhappy wretch! hath shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to be subject to his yoke again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to some strong protector will have flown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to his ignominy will maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And utter scorn, the lady as his own:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply may she to some losel flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will her paramour and pander be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For remedy; he sends in haste a band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of messengers, with letters far and nigh.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some of Argìa here, some there demand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor town unsearched is left in Lombardy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next he in person goes; nor any land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaves unexamined by himself or spy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet cannot he discover means or way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For learning where concealed his consort lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The servant last he called on whom was laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ill hest, but who had served not his despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither by his guidance was conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where (as ’twas said) she vanished from his sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who haply lurked by day in greenwood-shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to some friendly roof retired at night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thither guided, where but forest-trees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thinks to find, a sumptuous palace sees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This while for bright Argìa in that part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fay had made with speedy toil prepare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An alabaster palace by her art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gilded within, without, and everywhere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wonderful, no tongue could tell, no heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conceive, how rich within, without how fair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, which thou deemed so fair, my master’s home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is but a cottage to that costly dome.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Curtain and cloth of arras deck the wall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sumptuously woven and in different wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In vaulted cellar and in littered stall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only spread in latticed galleries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only spread in lordly bower and hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vase, gold and silver, gems of many dyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Carved into cup and charger, blue, red, green,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And countless cloths of silk and gold are seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He chanced upon the costly dome (as I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To you was in my story making known)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he expected not a hut to spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And but a weary waste of woodland lone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he beheld the dome with wondering eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anselmo thought his intellects were gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he was drunk, or dreamed that wondrous sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He weened, of that his wits had taken flight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“An Aethiop woman posted at the door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With blubber lip and nostril, he descries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will he see again, nor e’er before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had seen a visage of such loathsome guise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill-favoured⁠—such was Aesop feigned of yore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If there, she would have saddened Paradise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greasy and foul and beggarly her vest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor half her hideousness have I exprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Anselm, who saw no other wight beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell who was that mansion’s lord, drew nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the Aethiopian, and to her applied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she: ‘The owner of this house am I.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The judge was well assured the negress lied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made that answer but in mockery:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with repeated oaths the negress swears;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘ ’Tis hers, and none with her the mansions shares;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And would he see the palace, him invites</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To view it at his ease; and recommends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If there be ought within which him delights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To take it for himself or for his friends.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anselmo hears, and from his horse alights,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gives it his man; and o’er the threshold wends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the hag conducted, mounts from hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Below to bower above, admiring all.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Form, site, and sumptuous work doth he behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And royal ornament and fair device;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft repeats, not all this wide world’s gold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To buy the egregious mansion wound suffice.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him in answer said that negress old;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘And yet this dome, like others, hath its price;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If not in gold and silver, price less high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than gold and silver will the palace buy;’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And she to him prefers the same request,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which erst Adonio to Argìa made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fool he deemed the woman and possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for a boon so foul and filthy prayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet ceased she not, though more than thrice represt;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strove so well Anselmo to persuade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proffering, for his reward, the palace still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She wrought on him to do her evil will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The wife Argìa, that is hid fast by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in such sin her husband she descries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Springs forth and saith; ‘Ah! worthy deed! which I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of doctor, that was deemed so passing wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found in such foul and filthy work, espy!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bethink thee, if his kindling blushes rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he stands mute! why opens not thy hollow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And central womb, O earth, the wretch to swallow?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To clear herself and shame him, doth she stun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anselmo, never ceasing to upbraid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘What pain should by thyself be undergone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this so filthy deed, (Argìa said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou would’st take my life for having done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What Nature prompted and a lover prayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One that was fair and gentle, and who brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A gift, compared wherewith, this dome is nought?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘If worthy of one death thou deemest me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy art thou a hundred deaths to die:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though my pleasure might I do on thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So passing puissant in this place am I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other or worse vengeance done shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon my side, on thy delinquency.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The give against the take, O husband, place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as ’twas granted thee, so grant me grace:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And be there peace between us, and accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all be to forgetfulness consigned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor thee <em>I</em> of thy fault by deed or word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor me of mine, henceforward <em>thou</em> remind!’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This seemed a goodly bargain to her lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor to such pardon was he disinclined.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus peace and concord they at home restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And love each other dearly evermore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So said the mariner, and some brief fit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of laughter in Montalban’s master stirred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made his visage burn, as if ’twas lit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With fire, when of Anselmo’s shame he heard.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo greatly praised Argìa’s wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who by such quaint device had trapped that bird;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fell into the net wherein the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Herself erewhile had fallen, but with less shame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the sun climbed a steeper road, the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ordered the board with food to be supplied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the good Mantuan landlord overnight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took care with largest plenty to provide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While the fair town, upon the left, from sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Retired, and on the right that marish wide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Argenta is come and gone, with circling walls</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stream into whose bed Santerno falls.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-533" id="noteref-533" epub:type="noteref">533</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then was not fair Bastìa built, deem I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which little cause of boast affords to Spain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(That there her banner has been raised on high),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And causes deeper sorrow to Romagne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence in strait line their bark, that seems to fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the right shore the boatmen drive amain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next through a stagnant channel make, that near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ravenna brings by noon the cavalier.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-534" id="noteref-534" epub:type="noteref">534</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though oft of money he had small supply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then was the knight so well bested, he made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The weary rowers, in his courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A parting present, ere farewell was said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here changing horse and guide, to Rimini</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo rode that very eve, nor stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Montefiore till the night was done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well nigh reached Urbino with the sun.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then Frederick was not there of gentle lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor was Elizabeth nor Guido good;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Francis Maria nor sage Leonore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would in courteous, not in haughty mood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have forced so famed a paladin for more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than one short eye, with them to make abode;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they long did, and do unto this day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By dames and cavaliers who pass that way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since here none takes his rein, Rinaldo bends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His course an-end to Cagli; o’er the height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rifted by Gaurus and Metaurus, wends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Past Apennine, no longer on his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Umbri and Tuscans; and at Rome descends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Rome to Ostia goes Montalban’s knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to the city sails; wherein a grave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His pious son to old Anchises gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There changes back; and thence in haste he goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bound towards Lampedosa’s island-shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That place of combat chosen by the foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where they had encountered Frank and Moor.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo grants his boatmen no repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That do what can be done by sail and oar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with ill wind and strong the warrior strives;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, though by little, there too late arrives.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither he came what time Anglante’s peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The useful and the glorious deed had done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had slain those paynim kings in the career,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But had a hard and bloody conquest won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dead was Sir Brandimart; and Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dangerously hurt and sore, sate woe-begone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Somedeal apart, upon the sandy ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Martyred and crippled by his cruel wound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From tears could not the mournful Count refrain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When brave Rinaldo he embraced, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How in the battle Brandimart was slain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such love, such faith endeared the warrior dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less Rinaldo’s tears his visage stain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he so cleft beholds their comrade’s head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to embrace bold Oliviero, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sits with wounded foot, he makes repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All comfort that he could he gave; though none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could good Rinaldo to himself afford;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he came but when the feast was done:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea after the removal of the board.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The servants wend to the demolished town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There hide the bones of either paynim lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath Biserta’s ruined domes, and nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And far, the fearful tidings certify.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the fair conquest won by Roland’s blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sansonet and Astolpho make great cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet other mirth those warriors would have made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had Brandimart not perished; when they hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he is dead, their joy is so allayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They can no more the troubled visage clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which of them now the tidings of such woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the unhappy Flordelice shall show?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The night preceding that ill-omened day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flordelice dreamed the vest of sable grain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she had made, her husband to array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And woven with her hand and worked with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before her eyes all sprinkled-over lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With ruddy drops, in guise of pattering rain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she had worked it so the lady thought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then was grieved at seeing what was wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And seemed to say, “Yet from my lord have I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Command to make it all of sable hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now wherefore it is stained with other dye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against his will, in mode so strange to view?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She from that dream draws evil augury;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither on that eve the tidings flew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But these concealed Astolpho from the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he to her with Sansonetto came.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they are entered, and she sees no show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of joyful triumphs, she, without a word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without a hint to indicate that woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows that no longer living is her lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that her gentle heart was riven so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so her harassed eyes the light abhorred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so was every other sense astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, like one dead, she sank upon the ground.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She in her hair, when life returns again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fastens her hand; and on her lovely cheeks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repeating the beloved name in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all her force her scorn and fury wreaks;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uproots and tears, her locks, and in her pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like woman, smit by evil demon, shrieks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, as Bacchante at the horn’s rude sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile was seen to run her restless round.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now to the one, to the other now her prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She made for knife, wherewith her heart to smite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now she aboard the pinnace would repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That brought the corse of either paynim knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would on either, lifeless as they were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do cruel scathe, and vent her fierce despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now would she seek her lord, till at his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She rested from her weary search, and died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! wherefore, Brandimart, did I let thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without me wend on such a dire emprize?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She ne’er before did thy departure see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Flordelice aye followed thee,” she cries:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Well aided mightest thou have been by me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I on thee should still have kept my eyes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when Gradasso came behind thee, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee might have succoured with a single cry;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And haply I so nimbly might have made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between you, that the stroke I might have caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with my head, as with a buckler, stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For little ill my dying would have wrought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anyhow I shall die; and⁠—that debt paid⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My melancholy death will profit nought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, had I died, defending thee in strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I could not better have bestowed my life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Even is averse had been hard Destiny,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all heaven’s host, when thee I sought to aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least my tears had bathed thy visage, I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should the last kiss thereon, at least, have laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ere amid the blessed hierarchy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy spirit mixt⁠—‘Depart’⁠—I should have said⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘In peace, and wait me in thy rest; for there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where’er thou art, I swiftly shall repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Is this, O Brandimart, is this the reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose honoured sceptre thou wast now to take?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With thee to Dommogire, thy fair domain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus went I; me thus welcome dost thou make?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! what hope to-day thou renderest vain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! what designs, fell Fortune, dost thou break!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! wherefore fear I, since a lot so blest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is lost, to lose as well the worthless rest?’ ”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Repeating this and other plaint, so spite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fury waxed, that she in her despair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made new assault upon her tresses bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if the fault was wholly in her hair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wildly her hands together doth she smite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gnaw; with nails her lip and bosom tear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I return to Roland and his peers;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While she bemoans herself and melts in tears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roland with Olivier, who much requires</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such leech’s care, his anguish to allay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who, himself, some worthy place desires</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As much, wherein Sir Brandimart to lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Steers for the lofty mountain, that with fires</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brightens the night, with smoke obscures the day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wind blows fair, and on the starboard hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not widely distant from them, lies that land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With a fresh wind, that in their favour blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They loose their hawser at the close of day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In heaven above the silent goddess shows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her shining horn, to guide them on their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the following morn before them rose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pleasant shores that round Girgenti lay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here Roland orders for the ensuing night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All that is needful for the funeral rite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, when he saw his order duly done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now the westering sun’s fair light was spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many nobles, who from neighbouring town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At his invital, to Girgenti went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—The shore with torches blazing up and down,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sounding wide with cries and loud lament⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither returned where late, of life bereft,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His friends, beloved in life and death, was left.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There stands Bardino, weeping o’er the bier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who under Age’s heavy burden bows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, in the tears on shipboard shed whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might well have wept away his eyes and brows:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upbraiding skies and stars, the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like lion, in whose veins a fever glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roars as he wreathes his wayward hands within</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hoary hair, and rends his wrinkled skin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the paladin’s return the cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Redoubled, and the mourning louder grew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando to the corse approached more nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And speechless stood awhile, his friends to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pale, as at eve is the acanthus’ dye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or lily’s, which were plucked at morn: he drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A heavy sigh, and on the warrior dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixing his steadfast eyes, the County said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O comrade bold and true, there here liest slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who dost live in heaven above, I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rewarded with a life, thy glorious gain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which neither heat nor cold can take, my woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forgive, if thou beholdest me complain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because I sorrow to remain below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not to share in such delights with thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that thou art not left behind with me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alone, without thee, there is nought I may</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever possess, without thee, that can please.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If still with thee in tempest and affray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah wherefore not with thee in calm and ease?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right sore must be my trespass, since this clay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will not to follow thee my soul release.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If in thy troubles still I bore a burden,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why am I not a partner of thy guerdon?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thine is the guerdon; mine the loss; thy gain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is single; but not single is my woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Partners with me in sorrow are Almàyn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grieving France and Italy; and oh!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How will my lord and uncle, Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How will his paladins lament the blow!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How will the Christian church and empire moan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose best defence in thee is overthrown!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh! how thy foes will by the death of thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be freed henceforward from alarm and fear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! how strengthened paynimry will be!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What hardiment will now be theirs! what cheer!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What of thy consort will become? I see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even here her mourning, and her outcries hear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me she accuses, haply hates, I know;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, through me, her every hope lies low.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet by one comfort, Flordelice, is followed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His loss, for us that reft of him remain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His death, with such surpassing glory hallowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To die all living warriors should be fain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those Decii; Curtius, in Rome’s forum swallowed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cordus, so vaunted by the Grecian train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not with more honour to themselves, with more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Profit to others, went to death of yore.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These sad laments and more Orlando made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all this while white friars, and black, and gray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other clerks, by two and two arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind in long procession took their way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they to God for the departed prayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he would to his rest his soul convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before and all about were torches reared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And changed to day the sable night appeared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They raise the warrior’s bier, and ranged to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By turns that honoured weight were earl and knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pall was purple silk, with broidery rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of gold, and pearls in costly circles dight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thereon, of lordly work and no less fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cushions were laid, with jewels shining bright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On which was stretched the lifeless knight in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrayed in vest of like device and hue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A hundred men had past before the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All taken from the poorest of the town;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in one fashion equally were drest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those beadsmen all, in black and trailing gown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred pages followed them, who prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hundred puissant steeds, for warfare bown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by those pages backed, the portly steeds</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went, sweeping wide the ground with sable weeds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Banners in front and banners borne in rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose fields with diverse ensignry is stained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfurled accompany the funeral bier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from a thousand vanquished bands were gained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Caesar and for Peter’s church whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that rare force, which now extinct remained.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bucklers by other followers carried are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Won from good warriors, whose device they bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By hundreds and by hundreds followed more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ordained for different tasks, the steps of those;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who burning torches like those others bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mantled, say rather closely muffled, goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland in sables next, and evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His eyes suffused and red with weeping shows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor wears a gladder face Montalban’s peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At home his wound detains Sir Olivier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The ceremonies would be long to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In verse, wherewith Sir Brandimart was mourned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mantles, black or purple, given away;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The many torches which that eve were burned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wending to the cathedral, where the array</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Past on its road, were no dry eyes discerned:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All sexes, ages, ranks, in pitying mood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gazed upon him so youthful, fair, and good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He in the church was placed; and, when with vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lament the women had bemoaned the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And <i xml:lang="el-Latn">Kyrie eleison</i>, by the priestly train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other holy orisons were said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a fair ark, upraised on columns twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was reared, with sumptuous cloth of gold o’erspread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So willed Orlando; till he could be laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In sepulchre of costlier matter made:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor out of Sicily the Count departs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till porphyries he procures and alabasters,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fair designs; and in their several arts</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has with large hire engaged the primest masters.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next Flordelice, arriving in those parts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raises the quarried slabs and rich pilasters;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, good Orlando being gone before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is hither wafted from the Afric shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, seeing that her tears unceasing flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that of long lament she never tires</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor she, for mass or service said, her woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can ease, or satisfy her sad desires,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vows in her heart she thence will never go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till from the wearied corse her soul expires;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And builds in that fair sepulchre a cell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There shuts herself; therein for life will dwell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither in person, having courier sent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And letter, Roland goes, her thence to take;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, would she wend to France, with goodly rent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would gift, and Galerana’s inmate make;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As far as Lizza convoy her, if bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On journeying to her father; for her sake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If wholly she to serve her God was willed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A monastery would the warrior build.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Still in that sepulchre she dwelt, and worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By weary penance, praying night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was not long, ere by the Parcae shorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was her life’s thread: already on their way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were the three Christian warriors, homeward borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the isle in whose old caves the Cyclops lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sorrowing and afflicted sore in mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For their fourth comrade who remained behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They would not go without a leech, whose skill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might ease the wound of warlike Olivier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, as in the beginning it could ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be salved, is hard to heal. Meanwhile they hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The champion so complain, his outcries fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando and all that company with fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While they discoursed thereon, the skipper, moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By a new notion, said what all approved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A hermit not far distance hence, he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lonely rock inhabits in this sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose isle none, seeking succour, vainly tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether for counsel or for aid it be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hath done superhuman deeds; the dead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Restores to life; and makes the blind to see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hushes the winds; and with a sign o’ the cross</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lulls the loud billows when they highest toss;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And adds they need not doubt, if they will go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek that holy man to God so dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he on Olivier will health bestow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having his virtue proved by signs more clear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This counsel pleases good Orlando so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for the holy place he bids him steer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who never swerving from his course, espies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lonely rock, upon Aurora’s rise.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Worked by good mariners, the bark was laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safely beside the rugged rock and fell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The marquis there, with crew and servants’ aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They lowered into their boat; and through the swell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And foaming waters in that shallop made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the rude isle; thence sought the holy cell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy cell of that same hermit hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom Rogero was baptised before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The servant of the Lord of Paradise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Receives Orlando and the rest on land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blesses the company in cheerful wise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after of their errand makes demand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though he already had received advice</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From angels of the coming of that band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That they were thither bound in search of aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Oliviero’s hurt,” Orlando said;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who, warring for the Christian faith, in fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To perilous pass was brought by evil wound.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All dismal fear relieved that eremite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And promised he would make him wholly sound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that no unguents hath the holy wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is in other human medicine found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His church he seeks, his knee to Jesus bows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And issues from the fane with cheerful brows;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And in the name of those eternal Three,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Father, and the Son, and Holy Ghost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Oliviero bade his blessing be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! grace vouchsafed to faith! his sainted host</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From every pain the paladin did free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his foot restored its vigour lost.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He moved more nimble than before, and sure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And present was Sobrino at the cure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sobrino, so diseased that he described</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How worse with each succeeding day he grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as he that holy monk espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The manifest and mighty marvel do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disposed himself to cast Mahound aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And own in Christ a living God and true.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, full of faith, with contrite heart demands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Our holy rite of baptism at his hands.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So him baptised the hermit; and as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That monarch made as vigorous as whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At this conversion no less gladness fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Roland and each Christian cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than when, restored from deadly wound, and well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The friendly troop beheld Sir Olivier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero more rejoiced than all that crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still in faith and grace the warrior grew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero from the day he swam ashore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon that islet, there had ever been.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That band is counselled by the hermit hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who stands, benign, those warlike knights between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Eschewing in their passage mire and moor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wade withal through that dead water, clean,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which men call life; wherein so fools delight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And evermore on heaven to fix their sight.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Roland on shipboard sends one from his throng,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fetches hence good wine, hams, cheese, and bread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And makes the sage, who had forgotten long</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All taste of partridge since on fruits he fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even do for love, what others did, among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those social guests for whom the board was spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, when their strength by food was reinforced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of many things amid themselves discoursed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as in talk it often doth befall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That one thing from another takes its rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roland and Olivier Rogero call</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To mind for that Rogero, in such wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renowned in arms; whose valour is of all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lauded and echoed with accordant cries.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not even had Rinaldo known the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him whose prowess he had proved in fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him well Sobrino recognized whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as with that aged man espied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he at first kept silence; for in fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of some mistake the monarch’s tongue was tied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when those others knew the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that Rogero, famous far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose courtesy, whose might and daring through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The universal world loud Rumour blew,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All, for they know he is a Christian, stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About him with serene and joyful face:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All press upon the knight; one grasps his hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another locks him fast in his embrace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet more than all the others of that band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him would Montalban’s lord caress and grace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why more than all the others will appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other strain, if you that strain will hear.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Rinaldo his sister to the Child hath plight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to Marseilles is with the warrior gone:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And having crimsoned wide the field in fight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein arrives King Otho’s valiant son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Paris thence; where to that squadron bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is mighty grace and wonderous honour done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Child departs, resolved on Leo’s slaughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom Duke Aymon had betrothed his daughter.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>In poor abode, ’mid paltry walls and bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid discomforts and calamities,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often in friendship heart united are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better than under roof of lordly guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or in some royal court, beset with snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid envious wealth, and ease, and luxuries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where charity is spent on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor friendship, unless counterfeit, is spied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Hence it ensues that peace and pact between</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Princes and peers are of such short-lived wear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To-day king, pope, and emperor leagued are seen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the marrow deadly foemen are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because such is not as their outward mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart, the spirit, that those sovereigns bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, wholly careless as to right or wrong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to their profit look the faithless throng.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though little prone to friendship is that sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because with those she loveth not to dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, be their talk in earnest or in sport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Speak not, except some cozening tale to tell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet if together in some poor resort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They prisoned are by Fortune false and fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What friendship is they speedily discern;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though years had past, and this was yet to learn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In his retreat that ancient eremite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could bind his inmates with a faster noose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in true love more firmly them unite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than other could in domes where courtiers use;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so enduring was the knot and tight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That nothing short of death the tie could loose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Benignant all the hermit found that crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whiter at heart than swans in outward hue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All kind he found them, and of courteous lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Untainted with iniquity, in wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of them I painted, and who nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Go forth, unless concealed in some disguise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of injuries among them done before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All memory, by those comrades buried lies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could they better love, if from one womb</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from one seed that warlike band had come.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo more than all that lordly train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero graced and lovingly caressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well because be on the listed plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had proved the peer so strong in martial gest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that he was more courteous and humane</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than any knight that e’er laid lance in rest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But much more; that to him on many a ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By mighty obligation was he bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The fearful risk by Richardetto run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knew, and how Rogero him bested;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time the Spanish monarch’s hest was done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with his daughter he was seized in bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he had delivered either son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of good Duke Buovo (as erewhile was said)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From Bertolagi of Maganza’s hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His evil followers, and the paynim band.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To honour and to hold Rogero dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, Sir Rinaldo thought, this debt constrained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he could not so have done whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warlike lord was sorely grieved and pained;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When one for Afric’s monarch couched the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one the cause of royal Charles maintained:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now he Rogero for a Christian knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What could not then be done he now would do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Welcome, with endless proffers, on his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And honour he to good Rogero paid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prudent sire that in such kindness spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An opening made for more, the pass assayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And nothing else remains,” that hermit cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Nor will, I trust, my counsel be gainsaid)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that, conjoined by friendship, you shall be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet faster coupled by affinity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That from the two bright progenies, which none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will equal in illustrious blood below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A race may spring, that brighter than the sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will shine, wherever that bright sun may glow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And which, when years and ages will have run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their course, will yet endure and fairer show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While in their orbits burn the heavenly fires:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So me, for your instruction, God inspires.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And his discourse pursuing still, the seer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So spake, he moves Rinaldo by his rede</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give his sister to the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit with either small entreaties need.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together with Orlando, Olivier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The counsel lauds, and would that union speed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Charles and Aymon will, he hopes, approve,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And France will welcome wide their wedded love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So spake together peer and paladine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor knew that Aymon, with King Charles’ consent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unto the Grecian emperor Constantine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To give his gentle daughter had intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for young Leo, of his lofty line</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heir and hope, to crave the maid had sent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such warmth the praises of her worth inspired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With love of her unseen was Leo fired.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him hath Aymon answered; “he, alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot conclude thereon in other sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until he first hath spoken with his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo, absent then from Charles’s court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with winged haste, he deems, will thither run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joy in kinsman of such high report;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But from the high regard he bears his heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can nought resolve till thither he repair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now good Rinaldo, of his father wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of the imperial practice knowing nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Promised his beauteous sister as a bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his own, as well as Roland’s thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the others, harboured in that cell beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But most of all on him the hermit wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by such marriage, ’twas the peer’s belief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could not choose but pleasure Clermont’s chief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That day and night, and of the following day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Great part, with that sage monk the warriors spent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce mindful that the crew their coming stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit the wind blew fair for their intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But these, impatient at their long delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than one message to the warriors sent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to return those barons urged so sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Parforce they parted from the hermit hoar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Child who, so long banished, had not stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the lone rock, whereon the waters roared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His farewell to that holy master made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who taught him the true faith: anew with sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando girt his side, and with the blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frontino and martial Hector’s arms restored;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As knowing horse and arms were his whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well as out of kindness to the peer;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, though the enchanted sword with better right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have been worn by good Anglantes’ chief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from the fearful garden by his might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had won the blade<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-535" id="noteref-535" epub:type="noteref">535</a> with mickle toil and grief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than by Rogero, who that faulchion bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Received with good Frontino, from the thief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He willingly thereof, as with the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as asked, the warrior repossest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hermit blessings on the band implores:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They to their bark in fine return; their sails</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give to the winds, and to the waves their oars;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such clear skies they have and gentle gales,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor vow nor prayer the patron makes; and moors</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His pinnace in the haven of Marseilles.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There, safely harboured, let the chiefs remain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till I conduct Astolpho to that train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When of that bloody, dear-brought victory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The scarcely joyful tale Astolpho knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, seeing evermore fair France would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure from mischief from the Moorish crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Homeward to send the king of Aethiopy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Devised, together with his army, through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sandy desert, by the selfsame track,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through which he led them to Biserta’s sack.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Erewhile restored, in Afric waters ride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Dudon’s ships which did the paynims rout;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose prows (new miracle!) and poop, and side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as all their sable crews are out,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are changed anew to leaves; which far and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised by a sudden breeze, are blown about;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scattered in mid-air, like such light gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Go eddying with the wind, and disappear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Home, horse and foot, the Nubian host arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By squadrons, all, from wasted Afric go;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to their king, first, thanks Astolpho paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said, he an eternal debt should owe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that he had in person given him aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all his might and main against the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The skins Astolpho gave them, which confined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The turbid and tempestuous southern wind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I say, enclosed in skins that wind he gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in such fury blows at noon, on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I moves the shifting plain in many a wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fills the eddying sand the troubled sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To carry with them, and from scathe to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their squadrons, lest the dusty whirlwind fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bids them, when arrived at home, unnoose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bladder’s vent, and let their prisoners loose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When they have lofty Atlas’ passes won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The horses that the Nubian riders bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turpin relates, are changed at once to stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the steeds return to what they were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But it is time the Duke to France was gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who having thus provided, in his care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the main places in the Moorish land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made the hippogryph anew his wings expand;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He reached Sardinia at one flight and shear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Corsica from Sardinia; and then o’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The foaming sea his venturous course did steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inclining somewhat left the griffin’s soar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the sea-marshes last his light career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stopt, on rich Provence’s pleasant shore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where to the hyppogryph by him is done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What was erewhile enjoined by sainted John.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him the charge did sainted John commit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to Provence by that winged courser borne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him nevermore with saddle or with bit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To gall, but let him to his lair return.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already had the planet, whither flit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Things lost on earth, of sound deprived his horn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this not only hoarse but mute remained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as the holy place Astolpho gained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence to Marseilles he came; and came the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, and Rinaldo, and Olivier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived therein, upon their homeward way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With good Sobrino, and the better peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero: not so triumphs that array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touched by the death of him, their comrade dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they for such a glorious victory won</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—But for that sad disaster⁠—would have done.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of the kings slain upon the paynim part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The news from Sicily to Charles were blown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sobrino’s fate, and death of Brandimart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less of good Rogero had been shown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles stood with jocund fate and gladsome heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rejoicing he had from his shoulders thrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The intolerable load whereof the weight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will for long time prevent his standing straight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To honour those fair pillars that sustain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The state⁠—the holy empire’s corner-stone⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The nobles of his kingdom Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispatched, to meet the knights, as far as Saône;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from his city with his worthiest train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King, duke, and her, the partner of his throne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issued amid a fair and gorgeous band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of noble damsels, upon either hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The emperor Charles with bright and cheerful brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lords, paladins and people, kinsmen, friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair love to Roland and the others show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mongrana and Clermont’s cry the welkin rends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No sooner, mid that kind and festal show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The interchange of fond embracements ends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Roland and his friends Rogero bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mid those lords present him to the king;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And him Rogero of Risa’s son declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vouch in valour as his father’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Witnesses of his worth our squadrons are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They best can tell his prowess with the spear.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, the noble and the lovely pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa and gentle Bradamant appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This runs to fold Rogero to her heart;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More coy, that other stands somedeal apart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The emperor bids Rogero mount again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from his horse had lit, in reverence due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, side by side, with him his courser rein;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor aught omits that monarch which may do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior honour, mid his martial train:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How the true faith he had embraced he knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all instructed by that band before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When first those paladins set foot ashore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With pomp triumphal and with festive cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The troop returns within the city-walls:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With leaves and garlands green the streets appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tapestried all about with gorgeous palls.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of herbs and flowers a mingled rain, where’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They wend, upon the conquering squadron falls,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which with full hands from stand and window throw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Damsel and dame upon the knights below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At every turn, in various places are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of sudden structure arch and trophy high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereon Biserta’s sack is painted fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ruin and fire, and feat of chivalry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scaffolds, upraised for different sports elsewhere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And merrimake and stage-play meet the eye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, writ with truth, above, below, between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To <b>The Empire’s Saviours</b>, everywhere is seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With sound of shrilling pipe and trumpet proud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other festive music, laughter light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Applause and favour of the following crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which scarce found room, begirt with dames and knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty emperor, mid those greetings loud,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the royal palace did alight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where many days he feasted high in hall</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His lords, mid tourney, mummery, mask and ball.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His son to Aymon on a day made known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sister he would make Rogero’s bride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, before Olivier and Milo’s son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-536" id="noteref-536" epub:type="noteref">536</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her to the Child by promise had affied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who think with him that kindred is there none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith to league themselves, on any side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For valour or nobility of blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Better than his; nay, none so passing good.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Duke Aymon heard his heir with some disdain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, without concert with him, and alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He dared to plight his daughter, whom he fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would marry to the Grecian emperor’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not to him that has no kingly reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay has not ought that he can call his own;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And should not know, how little nobleness</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is valued without wealth; how virtue less.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But Beatrice, his wife, with more despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arraigns her son, and calls him arrogant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And moves each open way and hidden sleight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To break Rogero’s match with Bradamant;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved to tax her every means and might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make her empress of the wide Levant.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm in his purpose is Montalban’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will in ought forego his plighted word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beatrice who believes the high-minded fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is at her hest, exhorts her to reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Rather than she will be constrained to pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a poor knight, she is resolved to die;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, if this wrong she from Rinaldo bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will she regard her with a mother’s eye:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let her refuse and keep her steadfast course;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her free will Rinaldo cannot force.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Silent stands mournful Bradamant, nor dares</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile her lady-mother’s speech gainsay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom such reverence, and respect, she bears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thinks no choice is left but to obey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet a foul fault it in her eyes appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If what she will not do, she falsely say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She will not, for she cannot; since above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All guidance, great or small, is mighty Love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Deny she dared not, nor yet seem content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, sighed and spake not; but⁠—when uncontrolled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She could⁠—she gave her secret sorrow vent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While from her eyes the tears like billows rolled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A portion of the pains that her torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflicting on her breast and locks of gold:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this she beat, and those uptore and brake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus she made lament, and thus she spake.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! shall I will what she wills <em>not</em>, by right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More sovereign mistress of my will than I?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hers shall I hold so cheaply, so to slight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mother’s will, my own to satisfy?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! what blemish is so foul to sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In damsel? What so ill, as to affy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myself to husband, reckless of <em>her</em> will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ’tis my duty ever to fulfil?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wo worth the while! and shall I then to thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By filial love be forced to be untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O my Rogero, and surrender me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a new hope, a new love, and a new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desire; or rather from those ties break free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From all good children to good parents due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Observance, reverence cast aside; and measure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My duty by my happiness, my pleasure?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I know, alas! what I should do; I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That which a duteous daughter doth behove;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know; but what avails it, if not so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My reason moves me as my senses move;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she retires before a stronger foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can I of myself dispose, for Love;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor think how to dispose; so strict his sway;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, saving as he dictates, do and say?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Aymon and Beatrice’s child, the slave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Love am I; ah! miserable me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I from my parents am in hope to have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pardon and pity, if in fault I be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, if I anger Love, whose prayer shall save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me from his fury, till one only plea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of mine the Godhead shall vouchsafe to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor doom me dead as soon as I appear?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas! with long and obstinate pursuit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To our faith to draw Rogero have I wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And finally have drawn; but with what boot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If my fair deed for other’s good be wrought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So yearly by the bee, whose labour’s fruit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is lost for her, is hive with honey fraught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I will die ere I the Child forsake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other husband than Rogero take.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If I shall not obey my father’s hest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor mothers, I my brother’s shall obey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of greater wisdom far than them possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Time hath made that warrior’s wit his prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what <em>he</em> wills by Roland is profest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, one and the other, on my side are they;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pair more feared and honoured far and wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all the members of my house beside.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If them the flower of Clermont’s noble tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The glory and the splendor all account;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If all believe our other chivalry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They, more than head o’ertops the foot, surmount;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why would I Aymon should dispose of me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than good Rinaldo and the Count?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should not; so much less, as not affied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Leo, and Rogero’s promised bride.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If cruel thoughts the afflicted maid torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s mind enjoys not more repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For albeit those sad tidings have not vent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet in the city, he the secret knows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He o’er his humble fortunes makes lament</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which his enjoying such a good oppose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As unendowed with riches or with reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispensed so widely to a worthless train.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of other goods which Nature’s hand supplies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or which acquired by man’s own study are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He such a portion in himself espies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such and so large was never other’s share:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, no beauty with his beauty vies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, resistance to his might is rare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The palm by none from him can challenged be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In regal splendour, magnanimity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But they at whose disposal honours lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who give at will, and take away renown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vulgar herd; and from the vulgar I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Except the prudent man, distinguished none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor emperor, pope, nor king, is raised more high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than these by sceptre, mitre, or by crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor save by prudence; save by judgement, given</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to the favoured few by partial Heaven;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This vulgar (to say out what I would say)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which only honours wealth, therewith more smit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than any worldly thing beside, nor they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aught heed or aught esteem, ungraced with it,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be beauty or be daring what it may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dexterity or prowess, worth, or wit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or goodness⁠—yet more vulgar stands confest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that whereof I speak than in the rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero said; “If Aymon is disposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An empress in his Bradamant to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let not his treaty be so quickly closed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Leo; let a year be granted me:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that, meanwhile, I hope, by me deposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall Leo with his royal father be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I, encircled with their forfeit crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be for Aymon no unworthy son.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But if he give without delay, as said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His daughter to the son of Constantine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If to that promise no regard be paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which good Rinaldo and the paladine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cousin, erst before the hermit made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Marquis Olivier and King Sobrine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What shall I do? such grievous wrong shall I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endure, or, rather than endure it, die?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What shall I do? her father then pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom for vengeance this grave outrage cries?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I heed not that the deed is hard to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or if the attempt in me is weak or wise:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But presuppose that, with his kindred crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slain by my hand that unjust elder dies:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This will in nothing further my content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay it will wholly frustrate my intent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Twas ever my intent, and still ’tis so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have the love, not hatred, of that fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But should I Aymon slay, or bring some woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By plot or practice, on his house or heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will she not justly hold me as her foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And me, that foeman, as her lord forswear?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What shall I do, endure such injury?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! no, by Heaven! far rather I will die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nay die I will not; but with better right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall Leo die, who so disturbs my joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He and his unjust sire; less dear his flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Helen paid her paramour of Troy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet in older time that foul despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Done to Proserpina, cost such annoy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bold Pirithous, as for her I’ve lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My grief of heart shall son and father cost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Can it be true, my life, that to forsake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy champion for this Greek should grieve not thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And could thy father force thee him to take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though joined thy brethren with thy sire should be?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ’tis my fear that thou would’st rather make</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accord withal with Aymon than with me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that it seemeth better in thy sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To wed with Caesar than with simple wight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Can it be true that royal name should blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imperial title, pomp and majesty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And taint my Bradamant’s egregious mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her mighty valour and her virtue high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that, as cheaper, she should cast behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her plighted faith, and from her promise fly?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sooner she a foe to Love be made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than she no longer say, what once she said?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These things Rogero said, and more beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discoursing with himself, and in such strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oftentimes the afflicted warrior cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That stander-by o’erheard the knight complain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than once his grief was signified</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her that was the occasion of his pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who no less for his cruel woe, when known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamented than for sorrows of her own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But most, of all the sorrows that were said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To vex Rogero, most it works her woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hear that he afflicts himself, in dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest for the Grecian prince she him forego.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence this belief, this error, from his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To drive, comfort on the knight bestow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The trustiest of her bower-women, one day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She to Rogero bade these words convey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rogero, I what I was till death will be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be more faithful, if I can be more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deals Love in kindness or in scorn with me;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hath doubtful Fortune good or ill in store;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am a very rock of faith, by sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And winds unmoved, which round about it roar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor I have changed for calm or storm, nor I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will ever change to all eternity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Sooner shall file or chisel made of lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the rough diamond various forms impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than any stroke, by fickle Fortune sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Love’s keen anger, break my constant heart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sooner return, to Alp, their fountain-head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The troubled streams that from its summit part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than e’er, for change or chances, good or nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall wander from its way my steadfast thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“All power o’er me have I bestowed on you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero; and more than others may divine:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know that to a prince whose throne is new</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never fealty sworn more true than mine;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever surer state, this wide world through,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By king or keysar was possest than thine.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou need’st not dig a ditch nor build a tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fear lest any rob thee of that power.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For if thou hire no aids, assault is none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But what thereon shall aye be made in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor shall it be by any riches won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vile a price no gentle heart can gain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor by nobility, nor kingly crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That dazzle so the silly vulgar train;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor beauty, puissant with the weak and light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall ever make me thee for other slight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou hast no cause, amid thy griefs, to fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart should ever bear new impress more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So deeply is thine image graven here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It cannot be removed: that my heart’s core</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is not of wax is proved; for Love whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote it a hundred times, not once, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He by his blows a single scale displaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What time therein his hand thine image traced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ivory, gem, and every hard-grained stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That best resists the griding tool, may break:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, save the form it once hath taken, none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will ever from the graver’s iron take.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart like marble is, or thing least prone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the chisel’s trenchant edge to flake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love this may wholly splinter, ere he may</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another’s beauty in its core enlay.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Other and many words with comfort rife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And full of love and faith, she said beside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which might a thousand times have given him life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit a thousand times the knight had died:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when most clear of the tempestuous strife,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In friendly port these hopes appeared to ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These hopes a foul and furious wind anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far from the sheltering land to seaward blew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In that the gentle Bradamant, who fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would do far more than she hath signified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With wonted daring armed her heart again;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And boldly casting all respect aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One day stood up before King Charlemagne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, “Sire, if ever yet,” the damsel cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I have found favour in your eyes for deed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Done heretofore, deny me not its meed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I entreat, before I claim my fee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you to me your royal promise plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grant my prayer; and fain would have you see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That what I shall demand is just and right.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Thy valour, damsel dear, deserves from me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The boon wherewith thy worth I should requite”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Charles answered), “and I to content thee swear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though of my kingdom thou should’st claim a share.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The boon for which I to your highness sue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is not to let my parents me accord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Pursued the martial damsel) save he shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More prowess than myself, to any lord.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him contend with me in tourney, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have me, or assay me with the sword.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me as his wife let him that wins me, wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let him that loses me, with other pair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With cheerful face the emperor made reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“The entreaty was well worthy of the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that with tranquil mind she might rely,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would accord the boon for which she prayed.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This audience was not given so secretly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the news to others were conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which on that very day withal were told</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the ears of Beatrice and Aymon old;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who against Bradamant with fury flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And both alike, with sudden anger fraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For plainly they perceive, that in her claim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She for Rogero more than Leo wrought)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And active to prevent the damsel’s aim</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From being to a safe conclusion brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Privily take her from King Charles’s court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence to Rocca Forte’s tower transport.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A castle this, which royal Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had given to Aymon some few days before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Built between Carcasson and Perpignan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a commanding point upon the shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved to send her eastward, there the twain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As in a prison kept her evermore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Willing or nilling, so must she forsake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, and for lord must Leo take.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The martial maid of no less modest vein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than bold and full of fire before the foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit no guard on her the castellain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hath set, and she is free to come or go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Observant of her sire, obeys the rein:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet prison, death, and every pain and woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To suffer is resolved that constant maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before by her Rogero be betrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo, who thus ravished from his hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By ancient Aymon’s craft his sister spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saw he could no more in wedlock’s band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispose of her, by him in vain affied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his old sire complains, and him doth brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laying his filial love and fear aside:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But little him Rinaldo’s words molest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who by the maid will do as likes him best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, bearing this and sore afraid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he shall lose his bride; and Leo take,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If left alive, by force or love the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolved within himself (but nothing spake)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constantine’s heir should perish by his blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of Augustus him a god would make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-537" id="noteref-537" epub:type="noteref">537</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, save his hope deceived him and was vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would sire and son deprive of life and reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His limbs in arms, which Trojan Hector’s were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards the Tartar king’s, he steeled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade rein Frontino, and his wonted wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exchanged, crest, surcoat and emblazoned shield.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On that emprize it pleased him not to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His argent eagle on its azure field.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">White as a lily, was a unicorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him upon a field of crimson worn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He chose from his attendant squires the best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And willed none else should him accompany;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave him charge, that ne’er by him exprest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s name in any place should be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crost Meuse and Rhine, and pricked upon his quest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the Austrian countries into Hungary;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the right bank of the Danube made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rode an-end until he reached Belgrade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where Save into dark Danube makes descent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the sea, increased by him, doth flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saw the imperial ensigns spread, and tent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And white pavilion, thronged with troops below.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Constantine to have that town was bent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anew, late won by the Bulgarian foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In person, with his son, is Constantine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all the empire’s force his host to line.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Within Belgrade, and through the neighbouring peak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even to its bottom which the waters lave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Bulgar fronts him; and both armies seek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A watering-place in the intermediate Save.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bridge across that rapid stream the Greek</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fling; the Bulgar would defend the wave:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thither came Rogero; and engaged</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld the hosts in fight, which hotly raged.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Greeks in that affray were four to one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with pontoons to bridge the stream supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a bold semblance through their host put on</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of crossing to the river’s further side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leo meanwhile was from the river gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With covert guile; he took a circuit wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then thither made return; his bridges placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From bank to bank, and past the stream in haste.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With many horse and foot in battle dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who nothing under twenty thousand rank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the river rode the Grecian knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fiercely charged his enemies in flank.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The emperor, when his son appeared in sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leading his squadrons on the farther bank,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uniting bridge and bark together, crost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his part the stream with all his host.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Vatran, chief of the Bulgarian band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wise, bold, withal a warrior, here and there</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laboured in vain such onset to withstand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the disorder of his host repair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Leo prest him sore, and with strong hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king to earth beneath his courser bare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom at the prince’s hest, for all to fierce</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is he to yield, a thousand faulchions pierce.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Bulgar host hath hitherto made head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when they see their sovereign is laid low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And everywhere that tempest wax and spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They turn their backs where erst they faced the foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child, who mid the Greeks, from whom they fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was borne along, beheld that overthrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bowned himself their battle to restore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As hating Constantine and Leo more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He spurs Frontino, that in his career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is like the wind, and passes every steed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He overtakes the troop, that in their fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fly to the mountain and desert the mead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many he stops and turns; then rests his spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as he puts his courser to his speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fearful is his look, even Mars and Jove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are frighted in their azure realms above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Advanced before the others, he descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cavalier, in crimson vest, whereon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all its stalk in silk and gold was spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pod, like millet, in embroidery done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constantine’s nephew, by the sister’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was, but was no less beloved than son:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He split like glass his shield and scaly rind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the long lance appeared a palm behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He left the dead, and drew his shining blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a squadron, whom he saw most nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now at once, and now at other made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleft bodies, and made hearts from shoulders fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At throat, at breast and flank the warrior laid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote hand, and arm, and shoulder, bust, and thigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And through that champaign ran the reeking blood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to the valley foams the mountain-flood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>None that behold those strokes maintain their place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So are they all bewildered by their fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus suddenly the battle changed its face:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, catching courage from the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Bulgar squadrons rally, turn, and chase</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Grecian troops that fled from them whilere.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lost was all order in a thought, and they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all their banners fled in disarray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo Augustus on a swelling height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing his followers fly, hath taken post;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where woeful and bewildered (for to sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing in all the country round is lost)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from his lofty station eyes the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with his single arm destroys that host;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cannot choose, though so his prowess harms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But praise that peer and own his worth in arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He knew full well by ensignry displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By surcoat and by gilded panoply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That albeit to the foe he furnished aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That champion was not of his chivalry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wondering his superhuman deeds surveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now an angel seemed in him to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scourge the Greeks from choirs above descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose sins so oft and oft had heaven offended;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, as a man of great and noble heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Where many others would have hatred sworn)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enamoured of such valour, on his part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not desire to see him suffer scorn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For one that died, six Grecians’ death less smart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would cause that prince; and better had he borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To lose as well a portion of his reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to behold so good a warrior slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As baby, albeit its fond mother beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drive it forth in anger, in its fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither to sire nor sister makes retreat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to her arms returns with fondling cheer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So Leo, though Rogero in his heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slaughters his routed van and threats his rear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot that champion hate; because above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His anger is the admiring prince’s love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But if young Leo loved him and admired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meseems that he an ill exchange hath made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him Rogero loathed; nor aught desired</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than to lay him lifeless with his blade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him with his eyes he sought; for him inquired;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Leo’s fortune his desire gainsayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which with the prudence of the practised Greek,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made him in vain his hated rival seek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo, for fear his bands be wholly spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bids sound the assembly his Greek squadrons through:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to his father a quick courier sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pray “that he would pass the stream anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, if the way was open, well content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might with his bargain he;” and with a few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he collects, the Grecian cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Recrost the bridge by which he past whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Into the power o’ the Bulgars many fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stalin from the hill-top to the river-side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they into their hands had fallen all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for the river’s intervening tide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the bridge many drop, and drown withal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many that ne’er turned their heads aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence to a distant ford for safety made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many were dragged prisoners to Belgrade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When done was that day’s fight, wherein (since borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To ground the Bulgar king his life did yield)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His squadrons would have suffered scathe and scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not for them the warrior won the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior, that the snowy unicorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wore for his blazon on a crimson shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him all flock, in him with joy and glee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The winner of that glorious battle see.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some bow and some salute him; of the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some kist the warrior’s feet, and some his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round him as closely as they could they prest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And happy those are deemed, that nearest stand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More those that touch him; for to touch a blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And supernatural thing believes the band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him with shouts that rent the heavens they cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be their king, their captain, and their guide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As king or captain them will he command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As liked them best,” he said, “but will not lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On sceptre or on leading-staff his hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet Belgrade will enter on that day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For first, ere farther flies young Leo’s band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they across the river make their way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him will he follow, nor forego, until</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Grecian leader he o’ertake and kill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“A thousand miles and more for this alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thither measured, and for nought beside.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He saith; and from the multitude is gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by a road that’s shown to him doth ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For towards the bridge is royal Leo flown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply lest him from this the foe divide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind him pricks Rogero with such fire,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior calls not, nor awaits, his squire.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such vantage Leo has in flight (to flee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rather may be said than to retreat)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The passage open hath he found and free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then destroys the bridge and burns his fleet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero arrived not, till beneath the sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun was hid; nor lodging found; his beat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He still pursued; and now shone forth the moon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But town or village found the warrior none.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Because he wots not where to lodge, he goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All night, nor from his load Frontino frees.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the new sun his early radiance shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A city to the left Rogero sees;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there all day determines to repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As where he may his wearied courser ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he so far that livelong night had pressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor had he drawn his bit, nor given him rest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ungiardo had that city in his guard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constantine’s liegeman, and to him right dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, since upon the Bulgars he had warred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much horse and foot had sent that emperor; here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now entered (for the entrance was not barred)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, and found such hospitable cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to fare further had no need, in trace</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of better or of more abundant place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the same hostelry with him a guest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was lodged that evening a Romanian knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Present what time the Child with lance in rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Succoured the Bulgars in that cruel fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who hardly had escaped his hand, sore prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scared as never yet was living wight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he trembled still, disturbed in mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And deemed the knight of the unicorn behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He by the buckler knew as soon as spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier, whose arms that blazon bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him that routed the Byzantine side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By hand of whom so many slaughtered were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hurried to the palace, and applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For audience, weighty tidings to declare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, to Ungiardo led forthwith, rehearsed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What shall by men in other strain be versed.</span>

				<span>By how much higher we see poor mortal go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On Fortune’s wheel, which runs a restless round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We so much sooner see his head below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His heels; and he is prostrate on the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Lydian, Syracusan, Samian<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-538" id="noteref-538" epub:type="noteref">538</a> show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This truth, and more whose names I shall not sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All into deepest dolour in one day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurled headlong from the height of sovereign sway.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By how much more deprest on the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By how much more the wretch is downwards hurled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He so much sooner mounts, where he shall ride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If the revolving wheel again be twirled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some on the murderous block have well-nigh died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That on the following day have ruled the world.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ventidius, Servius, Marius this have shown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In ancient days; King Lewis in our own;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Lewis, stepfather of my duke’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, when his host at Santalbino fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left in <em>his</em> clutch by whom that field was won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was nigh remaining shorter by the head.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor long before the great Corvinus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-539" id="noteref-539" epub:type="noteref">539</a> run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A yet more fearful peril, worse bested:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both throned, when overblown was their mischance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One king of Hungary, one king of France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis plain to sight, through instances that fill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The page of ancient and of modern story,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ill succeeds to good, and good to ill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That glory ends in shame, and shame in glory;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that man should not trust, deluded still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In riches, realm, or field of battle, gory</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hostile blood, nor yet despair, for spurns</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Fortune; since her wheel for ever turns.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through that fair victory, when overthrown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were Leo and his royal sire, the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who won that battle to such trust is grown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his good fortune and his peerless might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, without following, without aid, alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So is he prompted by his daring sprite)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thinks, mid a thousand squadrons in array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Footmen and horsemen⁠—sire and son to slay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But she, that wills no trust shall e’er be placed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her by man, to him doth shortly show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How wight by her is raised, and how abased;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How soon she is a friend, how soon a foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She makes him know Rogero, that in haste</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is gone to work that warrior shame and woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier, which in that battle dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With much ado had from his faulchion fled.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He to Ungiardo hastens to declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child who put the imperial host to flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose carnage many years will not repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here past the day and was to pass the night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saith, that Fortune, taken by the hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more trouble, and without more fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will, if he prisons <em>him</em>, the Bulgars bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the yoke and lordship of his king.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ungiardo from the crowd, which had pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither their flight from the ensanguined plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For, troop by troop, a countless multitude</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, because not all the bridge could gain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew what a cruel slaughter had ensued:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For there the moiety of the Greeks was slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knew that by a cavalier alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One host was saved, and one was overthrown;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And that undriven he should have made his way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the net, and of his own accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wondered, and showed his pleasure, at the say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In visage, gesture, and in joyful word.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He waited till Rogero sleeping lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then softly sent his guard to take that lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made the valiant Child, who had no dread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of such a danger, prisoner in his bed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By his own shield accused, that witness true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child is captive in Novogorood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-540" id="noteref-540" epub:type="noteref">540</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Ungiardo, worst among the cruel, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marvellous mirth to have that prisoner shewed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what, since he was naked, could he do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bound, while his eyes were yet by slumber glued?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A courier, who the news should quickly bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ungiardo bids to Constantine repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Constantine on that night with all his host,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raising his camp, from Save’s green shore had gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this in Beleticche he takes post,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Androphilus’, his sister’s husband’s town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Father of him, whose arms in their first joust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As if of wax had been his habergeon)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had pierced and carved the puissant cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now by Ungiardo pent in dungeon drear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here from attack the emperor makes assure</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The city walls and gates on every side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest, from the Bulgar squadrons ill secure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Having so good a warrior for their guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His broken Grecians worse than fear endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deeming the rest would by his hand have died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now he is taken, these breed no alarms;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would he fear the banded world in arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The emperor, swimming in a summer sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows not for very pleasure what to do:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Truly the Bulgars may be said to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vanquished,” he cries, with bold and cheerful brow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As <em>he</em> would feel assured of victory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That had of either arm deprived his foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the emperor was assured, and so rejoiced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When good Rogero’s fate the warrior voiced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No less occasion has the emperor’s son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For joying; for besides that he anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Trusts to acquire Belgrade, and tower and town</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Throughout the Bulgars’ country to subdue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would by favours make the knight his own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hopes to rank him in his warlike crew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor need he envy, guarded by his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Charles’, Orlando’s, or Rinaldo’s aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Theodora was by other thoughts possest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose son was killed by young Rogero’s spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which through his shoulders, entering at his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issued a palm’s breadth in the stripling’s rear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constantine’s sister she, by grief opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell down before him; and with many a tear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That dropt into her bosom, while she sued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His heart with pity softened and subdued.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I still before these feet will bow my knee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save on this felon, good my lord,” (she cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who killed my son, to venge me thou agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now that we have him in our hold; beside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he thy nephew was, thou seest how thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loved; thou seest what feats upon thy side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That warrior wrought; thou seest if thou wilt blot</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine own good name, if thou avenge him not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou seest how righteous Heaven by pity stirred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the wide champaign, red with Grecian gore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears that fell man; and like a reckless bird</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the fowler’s net hath made him soar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That for short season, for revenge deferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My son may mourn upon the Stygian shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give me, <em>my</em> lord, I pray, this cruel foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That by his torment I may soothe my woe.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So well she mourns; and in such moving wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And efficacious doth she make lament;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor from before the emperor will arise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though he three times and four the dame has hent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to uplift by word and action tries)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he is forced her wishes to content;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus, according to her prayer, commands</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child to be delivered to her hands;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, not therein his orders to delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They take the warrior of the unicorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To cruel Theodora; but one day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of respite has the knight: to have him torn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In quarters, yet alive; to rend and slay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her prisoners publicly with shame and scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seems a poor pain; and he must undergo</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other unwonted and unmeasured woe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the commandment of that woman dread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Chains on his neck and hands and feet they don;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put him in a dungeon-cell, where thread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of light was never by Apollo thrown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He has a scanty mess of mouldy bread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sometimes is he left two days with none;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one that doth the place of jailer fill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is prompter than herself to work him ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! if Duke Aymon’s daughter brave and fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of if Marphisa of exalted mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had heard Rogero’s sad estate declare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how he in this guise in prison pined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his rescue either would have made repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would have flung the fear of death behind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor had bold Bradamant, intent to aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Respect to Beatrice or Aymon paid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile King Charlemagne upon his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heeding his promise made in solemn sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That none should have the damsel for his bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That of her prowess in the field fell short;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only had his sovereign pleasure cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With sound of trumpet in his royal court,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in each city subject to his crown.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence quickly through the world the bruit was blown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such the condition which he bids proclaim:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He that would with Duke Aymon’s daughter wed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must with the sword contend against that dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the suns rise until he seeks his bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if he for that time maintains the game,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is not overcome, without more said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady is adjudged to have lost the stake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor him for husband can refuse to take.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The choice of arms must be by her foregone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No matter who may claim it in the course:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the damsel this may well be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good at all arms alike, on foot or horse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Aymon, who cannot strive against the crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Cannot and will not⁠—yields at length parforce.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He much the matter sifts, and in the end</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resolves to court with Bradamant to wend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though for the daughter choler and disdain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mother nursed, yet that she honour due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might have, she garments, dyed in different grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had wrought for her, of various form and hue.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant for the court of Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departs, and finding not her love, to her view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His noble court appears like <em>that</em> no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had appeared to her so fair before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As he that hath beheld a garden, bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With flowers and leaves in April or in May,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next beholds it, when the sun his light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hath sloped toward the north, and shortened day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Finds it a desert horrid to the sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, now that her Rogero is away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Bradamant, who thither made resort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer what it was appeared that court.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What is become of him she doth not dare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Demand, lest more suspicion thence be bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But listens still, and searches here and there;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That this by some, unquestioned, may be said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knows he is gone, but has no notion where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warrior, when he went, his steps had sped:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, departing thence, he spake no word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save to the squire who journeyed with his lord.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! how she sighs! how fears the gentle maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing Rogero, as it were, was flown!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! how above all other terrors, weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fear, that to forget her he was gone!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, seeing Aymon still his wish gainsayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that to wed the damsel hope was none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fled, perchance, so hoping to be loosed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From toils wherein he by her love was noosed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And that with further end the youthful lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her from his heart more speedily to chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will rove from realm to realm, till one afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some dame, that may his former love efface;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even, as the proverb says, that in a board</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One nail drives out another from its place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A second thought succeeds, and paints the youth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arraigned of fickleness, as full of truth;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And her reproves for having lent an ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a suspicion so unjust and blind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so, this thought absolves the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that accuses; and both audience find;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now this way, now that, she seemed to veer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this, nor that⁠—irresolute of mind⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Preferred: yet still to what gave most delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Most promptly leaned, and loathed its opposite;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thinking, ever and anon, anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On that so oft repeated by the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As for grave sin, remorse and sorrow grew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she had nursed suspicion and affright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she, as her Rogero were in view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would blame herself, and would her bosom smite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And say; “I see ’twas ill such thoughts to nurse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, the cause, is even cause of worse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Love is the cause; that in my heart inlaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy form, so graceful and so fair to see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so thy darling and thy wit portrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And worth, of all so bruited, that to me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems impossible that wife or maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blest with thy sight, should not be fired by thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that she should not all her art apply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To unbind, and fasten thee with other tie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ah! wellaway! if in my thought Love so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy thought, as thy fair visage, had designed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This⁠—am I well assured⁠—in open show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As I unseen believe it, should I find;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be so quit of Jealousy, that foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not still harass my suspicious mind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, where she is by me repulsed with pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not quelled and routed would she be, but slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I am like miser, so intent on gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who hath this so buried in his heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he, for hoarded treasure still in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot live gladly from his wealth apart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I Rogero neither see nor hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More puissant far than Hope, O Fear! thou art;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee, though false and idle I give way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cannot choose but yield myself thy prey.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But I, Rogero, shall no sooner spy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The light of thy glad countenance appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against mine every credence, from mine eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed (and woe is me), I know not where⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! how true Hope false Fear shall from on high</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Depose withal, and to the bottom bear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! turn to me, Rogero! turn again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And comfort Hope, whom Fear hath almost slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As when the sun withdraws his glittering head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The shadows lengthen, causing vain affright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And as the shadows, when he leaves his bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vanish, and reassure the timid wight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without Rogero so I suffer dread;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dread lasts not, if Rogero is in sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return to me, return, Rogero, lest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My hope by fear should wholly be opprest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As every spark is in the night alive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And suddenly extinguished when ’tis morn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When me my sun doth of his rays deprive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against me felon Fear uplifts his horn:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But they the shades of night no sooner drive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Fears are past and gone, and Hopes return.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return, alas! return, O radiance dear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And drive from me that foul, consuming Fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If the sun turn from us and shorten day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Earth all its beauties from the sight doth hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wild winds howl, and snows and ice convey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bird sings not; nor is leaf or flower espied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, whensoever thou thy gladsome ray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O my fair sun, from me dost turn aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand, and all evil, dreads, make drear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Winter within me many times a year.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Return, my sun, return! and springtide sweet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which evermore I long to see, bring back;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dislodge the snows and ice with genial hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clear my mind, so clouded o’er and black.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Philomel, or Progne, with the meat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returning, which her famished younglings lack,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mourns o’er an empty nest, or as the dove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laments himself at having lost is love;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The unhappy Bradamant laments her so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing the Child is reft from her and gone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While often tears her visage overflow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she, as best she can, conceals her moan.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! how⁠—oh! how much worse would be her woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If what she knew not to the maid were known!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, prisoned and with pain and pine consumed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her consort to a cruel death was doomed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The cruelty which by that beldam ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was practised on the prisoned cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And who prepared the wretched Child to kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By torture new and pains unused whilere,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While so Rogero pined, the gracious will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Heaven conveyed to gentle Leo’s ear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put into his heart the means to aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not to let such worth be overlaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The courteous Leo that Rogero loved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that the Grecian knew howe’er that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero was, but by that valour moved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sole and superhuman seemed to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought much, and mused, and planned, how it behoved</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And found at last a way⁠—to set him free;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that his cruel aunt should have no right</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To grieve or say he did her a despite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In secret, Leo with the man that bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prison-keys a parley had, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“He wished to see that cavalier, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the wretch was done a doom so dread.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When it was night, one, faithful found of yore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bold, strong, and good in brawl, he thither led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—by the silent warder taught that none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Must know ’twas Leo⁠—was the door undone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo, escorted by none else beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was led by the compliant castellain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his companion, to the tower, where stied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was he, reserved for nature’s latest pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There round the neck of their unwary guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who turns his back the wicket to unchain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A slip-knot Leo and his follower cast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, throttled by the noose, he breathes his last.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-541" id="noteref-541" epub:type="noteref">541</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>—The trap upraised, by rope from thence suspended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For such a need⁠—the Grecian cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lighted flambeau in his hand, descended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, straitly bound, and without sun to cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero lay, upon a grate extended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less than a palm’s breadth of the water clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To kill him in a month, or briefer space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing was needed but that deadly place.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lovingly Leo clipt the Child, and, “Me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O cavalier! thy matchless valour,” cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Hath in indissoluble bands to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In willing and eternal service, tried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wills thy good to mine preferred should be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I for thine my safety set aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And weigh thy friendship more than sire, and all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom I throughout the world my kindred call.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I Leo am, that thou what fits may’st know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come to thy succour, the Greek emperor’s son:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If ever Constantine, my father, trow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I have aided thee, I danger run</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be exiled, or aye with troubled brow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Regarded for the deed that I have done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thee he hates because of those thy blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Put to the rout and slaughtered near Belgrade.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He his discourse with more beside pursues,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That might from death to life the Child recall;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all this while Rogero’s hands doth loose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Infinite thanks I owe you,” cries the thrall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“And I the life you gave me, for your use</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will ever render back, upon your call;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still, at all your need, I for your sake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at all times, that life will promptly stake.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero is rescued; and the gaoler slain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is left in that dark dungeon in his place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is Rogero known, nor are the twain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leo the warrior, free from bondage base,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Brings home, and there in safety to remain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Persuades, in secret, four or six days’ space:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Meanwhile for him will he retrieve the gear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And courser, by Ungiardo reft whilere.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Open the gaol is found at dawn of light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gaoler strangled, and Rogero gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some think that <em>these</em> or <em>those</em> had helped his flight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All talk; and yet the truth is guessed by none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well may they think by any other wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than Leo had the deed been done;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For many deemed he had cause to have repaid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child with scathe, and none to give him aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So wildered by such kindness, so immersed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In wonder, is the rescued cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So from those thoughts is he estranged, that erst</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So many weary miles had made him steer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His second thoughts confronting with his first,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor these like those, nor those like these appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He first with hatred, rage, and venom burned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pity and with love then wholly yearned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much muses he by night and much by day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Nor cares for ought, nor ought desires beside⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By equal or more courtesy to pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty debt that him to Leo tied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be his life long or short, or what it may,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albeit to Leo’s service all applied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dies he a thousand deaths, he can do nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But more will be deserved, Rogero thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither meanwhile had tidings been conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Charles’ decree; “that who in nuptial tie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would yoke with Bradamant, with trenchant blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or lance must with the maid his prowess try.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These news the Grecian prince so ill appaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cheek was seen to blanch with sickly dye;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because, as one that measured well his might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knew he was no match for her in fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Communing with himself, he can supply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He sees) the valour wanting with his wit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the strange knight with his own ensignry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose name is yet unknown to him, will fit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him he against Frank champion, far and nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believes he may for force and daring pit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if the knight to that emprize agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vanquished and taken Bradamant will be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But two things must he do; must, first, dispose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That cavalier to undertake the emprize;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then send afield the champion, whom he chose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In mode, that none suspect the youth’s disguise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the matter Leo doth disclose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after prays in efficacious wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he the combat with the maid will claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under false colours and in other’s name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much weighs the Grecian’s eloquence; but more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than eloquence with good Rogero weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty obligation which he bore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That debt which cannot ever be repaid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So, albeit it appeared a hardship sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thing well-nigh impossible, he said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With blither face than heart, “that Leo’s will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all that he commands he would fulfil.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Albeit no sooner he the intent exprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than with sore grief Rogero’s heart was shent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, night and day, and ever, doth molest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever afflict him, evermore torment:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And though he sees his death is manifest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never will he confess he doth repent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than not with Leo’s prayer comply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand deaths, not one, the Child will die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Right sure he is to die; if he forego</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady, he foregoes his life no less.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His heart will break through his distress and woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, breaking not with woe and with distress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will, himself, the bands of life undo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of its clay the spirit dispossess.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For all things can he better bear than one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than see that gentle damsel not his own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To die is he disposed; but how to die</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot as yet the sorrowing lord decide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sometimes he thinks his prowess to belie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And offer to her sword his naked side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For never death can come more happily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if her hand the fatal faulchion guide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then sees, except he wins the martial maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that Greek prince, the debt remains unpaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For he with Bradamant, as with a foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Promised to do, not feign, a fight in mail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not to make of arms a seeming show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that his sword should Leo ill avail.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then by his word will he abide; and though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His breast now these now other thoughts assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All from his bosom chased the generous youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that which moved him to maintain his truth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With the emperor’s licence, armour to prepare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And steeds meanwhile had wrought his youthful son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with such goodly following as might square</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his degree, upon his way was gone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him Rogero rides, through Leo’s care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Equipt with horse and arms, that were his own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Day after day the squadron pricks; nor tarries</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until arrived in France; arrived at Paris.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo will enter not the town; but nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pitches his broad pavilions on the plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his arrival by an embassy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes known that day to royal Charlemagne.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well pleased is he; and visits testify</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many gifts the monarch’s courteous vein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His journey’s cause the Grecian prince displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to dispatch his suit the sovereign prayed:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To send afield the damsel, who denied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ever to take in wedlock any lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weaker than her: for she should be his bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or he would perish by the lady’s sword.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles undertook for this; and, on her side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The following day upon the listed sward</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the walls, in haste, enclosed that night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared the martial maid, equipt for fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero past the night before the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein by him the battle should be done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like that which felon spends, condemning to pay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Life’s forfeit with the next succeeding sun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made his choice to combat in the fray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All armed; because he would discovery shun:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor barded steed he backed, nor lance he shook;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other weapon than his faulchion took.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No lance he took: yet was it not through fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that which Argalìa whilom swayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho’s next; then hers, that in career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her foemen ever upon earth had laid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because none weened such force was in the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor that it was by necromancy made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Excepting royal Galaphron alone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had it forged, and gave it to his son.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nay, bold Astolpho, and the lady who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afterwards bore it, deemed that not to spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But simply to their proper force, was due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The praise that they in knightly joust excel;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with whatever spear they fought, those two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed that they should have performed as well.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What only makes that knight the joust forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is that he would not his Frontino show.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For easily that steed of generous kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She might have known, if him she had espied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom in Montalban, long to her consigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle damsel had been wont to ride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, that but schemes, but hath in mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he from Brandamant himself shall hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Neither Frontino nor yet other thing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whereby he may be known, afield will bring.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With a new sword will he the maid await;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For well he knew against the enchanted blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soft as paste would prove all mail and plate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For never any steel its fury stayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heavily with hammer, to rebate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its edge, as well he on this faulchion laid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So armed, Rogero in the lists appeared,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When the first dawn of day the horizon cheered.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To look like Leo, o’er his breast is spread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The surcoat that the prince is wont to wear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the gold eagle with its double head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He blazoned on the crimson shield doth bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (what the Child’s disguisement well may stead)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of equal size and stature are the pair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the other’s form presents himself the one;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other lets himself be seen of none.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dordona’s martial maid is of a vein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Right different from the gentle youth’s, who sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hammers and blunts the faulchion’s tempered grain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest it his opposite should cleave or bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She whets her steel, and into it would fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enter, that stripling to the quick to gore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yea, would such fury to her strokes impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That each should go directly to his heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As on the start the generous barb in spied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he the signal full of fire attends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And paws now here now there; and opens wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His nostrils, and his pointed ears extends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the bold damsel, to the lists defied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who knows not with Rogero she contends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed to have fire within her veins, nor found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resting-place, waiting for the trumpet’s sound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As sometimes after thunder sudden wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Turns the sea upside down; and far and nigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dim clouds of dust the cheerful daylight blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raised in a thought from earth, and whirled heaven-high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scud beasts and herd together with the hind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And into hail and rain dissolves the sky;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So she upon the signal bared her brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fell on her Rogero, sword in hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But well-built wall, strong tower, or aged oak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more are moved by blasts that round them rave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more by furious sea is moved the rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote day and night by the tempestuous wave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in those arms, secure from hostile stroke,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which erst to Trojan Hector Vulcan gave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moved was he by that ire and hatred rank</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which stormed about his head, and breast, and flank.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now aims that martial maid a trenchant blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now gives point; and wholly is intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt plate and plate to reach her hated foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that her stifled fury she may vent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now on this side, now that, now high, now low</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She strikes, and circles him, on mischief bent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And evermore she rages and repines;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As balked of every purpose she designs.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As he that layeth siege to well-walled town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And flanked about with solid bulwarks, still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Renews the assault; now fain would batter down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gateway or tower; now gaping fosse would fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet vainly toils (for entrance is there none)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wastes his host, aye frustrate of his will;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sorely toils and strives without avail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel, nor can open plate or mail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sparks now his shield, now helm, now cuirass scatter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While straight and back strokes, aimed now low, now high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which good Rogero’s head and bosom batter,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And arms, by thousands and by thousands fly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster than on the sounding farm-roof patter</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hailstones descending from a troubled sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, at his ward, with dexterous care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defends himself, and ne’er offends the fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now stopt, now circled, now retired the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oft his hand his foot accompanied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lifted shield, and shifted sword in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where shifting he the hostile hand espied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Either he smote her not, or⁠—die he smite⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote, where he deemed least evil would betide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady, ere the westering sun descend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desires to bring that duel to an end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of the edict she remembered her, and knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her peril, save the foe was quickly sped:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if she took not in one day, nor slew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her claimant, she was taken; and his head</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Phoebus was now about to hide from view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nigh Hercules’ pillars, in his watery bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When first she ’gan misdoubt her power to cope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the strong foe, and to abandon hope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By how much more hope fails the damsel, so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Much more her anger waxes; she her blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Redoubling, yet the harness of her foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will break, which through that day unbroken shows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he, that at his daily drudgery slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sees night on his unfinished labour close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hurries and toils and moils without avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till wearied strength and light together fail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Didst thou, O miserable damsel, trow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom thou wouldst kill, if in that cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Matched against thee thou didst Rogero know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On whom depend thy very life-threads, ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou killed him thou wouldst kill thyself; for thou,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know, dost hold him than thyself more dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when he for Rogero shall be known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know these very strokes thou wilt bemoan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Charles and peers him sheathed in plate and shell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deem not Rogero, but the emperor’s son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And viewing in that combat fierce and fell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such force and quickness by the stripling shown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, without e’er offending her, how well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That knight defends himself, now change their tone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteem both well assorted; and declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The champions worthy of each other are.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Phoebus wholly under water goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charlemagne bids the warring pair divide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Bradamant (nor boots it to oppose)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Allots to youthful Leo as a bride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not there Rogero tarried to repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor loosed his armour, nor his helm untied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On a small hackney, hurrying sore, he went</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Leo him awaited in his tent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Twice in fraternal guise and oftener threw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leo his arms about the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next his helmet from his head withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kiss’d him on both cheeks with loving cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I would,” he cried, “that thou wouldst ever do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By me what pleaseth thee; for thou wilt ne’er</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weary my love: at any call I lend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee myself and state; these friendly spend;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor see I recompense, which can repay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mighty obligation that I owe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though of the garland I should disarray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My brows, and upon thee that gift bestow.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, on whom his sorrows press and prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who loathes his life, immersed in that deep woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little replies; the ensigns he had worn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Returns, and takes again his unicorn;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And showing himself spiritless and spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence as quickly as he could withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from young Leo’s to his lodgings went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When it was midnight, armed himself anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saddled his horse, and sallied from his tent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He takes no leave, and none his going view;)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And his Frontino to that road addrest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seemed to please the goodly courser best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now by straight way and now by crooked wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Frontino, now by wood and wide champaign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all night with his rider paced that round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who never ceased a moment to complain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He called on Death, and therein comfort found;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since broke by him alone is stubborn pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor saw, save Death, what other power could close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The account of his insufferable woes.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Whereof should I complain,” he said, “wo is me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So of my every good at once forlorn?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ah! if I will not bear this injury</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without revenge, against whom shall I turn?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I, besides myself, none other see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hath inflicted on me scathe and scorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then I to take revenge for all the harm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Done to myself, against myself must arm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet was but to myself this injury done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myself to spare (because this touched but me)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I haply could, yet hardly could, be won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nay, I will say outright, I could not be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Less can I be, since not to me alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Bradamant, is done this injury;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Even if I could consent myself to spare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It fits me not unvenged to leave that fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then I the damsel will avenge, and die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor this disturbs me) whatsoe’er betide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, bating death, I know not aught, whereby</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defence against my grief can be supplied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I lament myself alone, that I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before offending her, should not have died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O happier Fortune! had I breathed my last</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Theodora’s dungeon prisoned fast!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Though she had slain, had tortured me before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She slew, as prompted by her cruelty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At least the hope would have remained in store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I by Bradamant should pitied be:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when she knows that I loved Leo more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than her, that, of my own accord and free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myself of her, I for his good, deprive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dead will she rightly hate me or alive.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These words he said and many more, with sigh</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And heavy sob withal accompanied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, when another sun illumed the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid strange and gloomy woods himself espied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for he desperate was and bent to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, as best he could, his death would hide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This place to him seemed far removed from view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fitted for the deed that he would do.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He entered into that dark woodland, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thickest trees and most entangled, spied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first Frontino was the warrior’s care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he unharnessed wholly, and untied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“O my Frontino, if thy merits rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I could reward, thou little cause” (he cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Shouldst have to envy him, so highly graced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who soared to heaven, and mid the stars was placed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-542" id="noteref-542" epub:type="noteref">542</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor Cillarus, nor Arion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-543" id="noteref-543" epub:type="noteref">543</a> was whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthier than thee, nor merited more praise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any other steed, whose name we hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sounded in Grecian or in Latin lays.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was any such in other points thy peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None of them, well I know, the vaunt can raise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That such high honour and such courtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were upon him bestowed, as were on thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Since to the gentlest maid, of fairest dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And boldest that hath been, or evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will be, thou wast so dear, she used to tie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy trappings, and to thee thy forage bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dear wast thou to my lady love: Ah! why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Call I her mine, since she is mine no more?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If I have given her to another lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why turn I not upon myself this sword?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If him these thoughts so harass and torment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That bird and beast are softened by his cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For, saving these, none hears the sad lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor sees the flood that trickles form his eyes)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You are not to believe that more content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Lady Bradamant in Paris lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who can no longer her delay excuse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Leo for her wedded lord refuse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ere she herself to any consort tie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside her own Rogero, she will fain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Do what so can be done; her word belie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Anger friends, kindred, court, and Charlemagne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if she nothing else can do, will die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By poison or her own good faulchion slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For not to live appears far lesser woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than, living, her Rogero to forego.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Rogero mine, ah! wonder gone” (she cried)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Art thou; and canst thou so far distant be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou heardest not this royal edict cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thing concealed from none, expecting thee?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster than thee would none have hither hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I wot, hadst thou known this; ah! wretched me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How can I e’er in future think of aught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saving the worst that can by me be thought?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“How can it be, Rogero, thou alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hast read not what by all the world is read?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou hast read it not, nor hither flown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How canst thou but a prisoner be, or dead?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But well I wot, that if the truth were known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This Leo will for thee some snare have spread:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The traitor will have barred thy way, intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou shouldst not him by better speed prevent.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“From Charles I gained the promise, that to none</span>

				<span class="i1">With whom I should in arms have vainly striven.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None I esteemed, excepting thee alone:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But well my rashness is rebuked by Heaven:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I by one am taken in this wise</span>

				<span class="i1">Unfamed through life for any fair emprize.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“If I am held as taken, since the knight</span>

				<span class="i1">I had not force to take nor yet to slay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thing that is not, in my judgment, right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor I to Charles’s sentence will give way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know that I shall be esteemed as light,</span>

				<span class="i1">If what I lately said, I now unsay;</span>

				<span class="i1">For light, I am not, I, the first or last.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Enough I to my lover faith maintain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, firmer than a rock, am still found true!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And far herein surpass the female train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That were in olden days, or are in new!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, if they me as fickle shall arraign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Care I, so good from fickleness ensue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though I am lighter than a leaf be said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So I be forced not with that Greek no wed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These things and more beside the damsel bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(’Twixt which oft sobs and tears were interposed),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ceased not to utter through the livelong night</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which upon that unhappy day had closed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when within Cimmeria’s caverned height</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nocturnus with his troops of shades reposed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Heaven, which eternally had willed the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should be Rogero’s consort, brought him aid:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This moves the haught Marphisa, when ’tis morn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To appear before the king; to whom that maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saith, “to the Child, her brother, mighty scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was done; nor should he be so ill appaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from him should his plighted wife be torn;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nought thereof unto the warrior said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on whoever lists she will in strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prove Bradamant to be Rogero’s wife;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And this, before all others, will prove true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On her, if to deny it she will dare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For she had to Rogero, in her view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spoken those words, which they that marry swear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with all ceremony wont and due</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was the contract sealed between the pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They were no longer free; nor could forsake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The one the other, other spouse to take.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether Marphisa true or falsely spake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I well believe that, rather with intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young Leo’s purpose, right or wrong, to break,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than tell the truth, she speaks; and with consent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Bradamant doth that avowal make:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For to exclude the hated Leo bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of Rogero to be repossest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This she believes her shortest way and best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sorely by this disturbed, King Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade Bradamant be called, and to her told</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That which the proud Marphisa would maintain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Aymon present in the press behold!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Bradamant drops her head, nor treats as vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor vouches what avows that virgin bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such confusion, they may well believe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That fierce Marphisa speaks not to deceive.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Joy good Orlando and joy Rinaldo show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who view in valorous Marphisa’s plea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cause the alliance shall no further go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which sealed already Leo deemed to be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet, in spite of stubborn Aymon’s no,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant shall Rogero’s consort be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And they may, without strife, without despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Done to Duke Aymon’s, give her to the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For if such words have pass’d between the twain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fast is the knot and cannot be untied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They what they vowed more fairly will obtain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And without further strife are these affied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“This is a plot, a plot devised in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ye deceive yourselves (Duke Aymon cried);</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, were the story true which ye have feigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believe not therefore that your cause is gained.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For granting what I will not yet allow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what I to believe as yet demur;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That weakly to Rogero so her vow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was plighted, as Rogero’s was to her;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where was the contract made, and when and how?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More clearly this to me must ye aver.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Either it was not so, I am advised;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or was before Rogero was baptised.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But if it were before the youthful knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Christian was, I will not heed it, I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ’twixt a faithful and a paynim wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I deem that nought avails the marriage-tie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this not vainly in the doubtful fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should Constantine’s fair son have risked to die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Charlemagne for this, our sovereign lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will forfeit, I believe, his plighted word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What now you say you should before have said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While yet the matter was unbroke, and ere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charles at my daughter’s prayer that edict made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which has drawn Leo to the combat here.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando and Rinaldo were gainsayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So before royal Charles by Clermont’s peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And equal Charlemagne heard either side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither would for this nor that decide.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in the southern or the northern breeze</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greenwood murmurs; and as on the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Aeolus with the god that rules the seas</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is wroth, the hoarse and hollow breakers roar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So a loud rumour of this strife, that flees</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through France, and spreads and circles evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Affords such matter to rehearse and hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That nought beside is bruised far or near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These with Rogero, those with Leo side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the most numerous are Rogero’s friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who against Aymon, ten to one, divide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Good Charlemagne to neither party bends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But wills that cause shall be by justice tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his parliament the matter sends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, now the bridal was deferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared anew, and other question stirred;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And said, “In that anther cannot have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant, while my brother is alive,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let Leo, if the gentle maid he crave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foe in listed fight of life deprive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he, that sends the other to his grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Freed from his rival, with the lady wive.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith this challenge, as erewhile the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Leo was declared at Charles’ behest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo who if he had the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the unicorn, believed he from his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was safe; and thought no peril would appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too hard a feat for him; and knew not how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence into solitary woods and drear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That warrior had been hurried by his woe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him gone for little time and for disport</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed, and took his line in evil sort.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This shortly Leo was condemned to rue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he, on whom too fondly he relied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor on that day nor on the following two</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared, nor news of him were signified;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And combat with Rogero was, he knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unsafe, unless that knight was on his side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sent, to eschew the threatened scathe and scorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek the warrior of the unicorn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through city, and through hamlet, and through town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sends to seek Rogero, far and near:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not content with this, himself is gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In person, on his steed, to find the peer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But of the missing warrior tidings none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor he nor any of the Court would hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for Melissa: I for other verse</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reserve myself, her doings to rehearse.</span>

				</h2>
				<p>
					<span>After long search for good Rogero made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him Leon finds, and yields to him his prize:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Informed of all⁠—already with that maid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wives; already in her bosom lies:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thither he that Sarza’s sceptre swayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To infect such bliss with impious venom hies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But falls in combat; and, blaspheming loud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Acheron descends his spirit proud.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>I, if my chart deceives me not, shall now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In little time behold the neighbouring shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hope withal to pay my promised vow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To one, so long my guide through that wide roar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of waters, where I feared, with troubled brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scathe my bark or wander evermore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now, methinks⁠—yea, now I see the land;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I see the friendly port its arms expand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A burst of joy, like thunder to my ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rumbles along the sea and rends the sky.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I chiming bells, I shrilling trumpets hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Confounded with the people’s cheerful cry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now their forms, that swarm on either pier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the thick-crowded harbour, I descry.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All seem rejoiced my task is smoothly done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I so long a course have safely run.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What beauteous dames and sage, here welcome me!</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My sail; and with them joy a hundred more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Women and men I see, a mingled crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At my return rejoicing, crowd the shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, since the wind blows fair, nor much to do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remains, let me my course delay no more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turning to Melissa, in what way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She rescued good Rogero let me say.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Much bent was this Melissa (as I know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I many times have said to you whilere)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Bradamant in wedlock should bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hand upon the youthful cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so at heart had either’s weal and woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she from hour to hour of them would hear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence ever on that quest she spirits sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One still returning as the other went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A prey to deep and stubborn grief, reclined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid gloomy shades Rogero they descried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm not to swallow food of any kind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor from that purpose to be turned aside;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so to die of hunger he designed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But weird Melissa speedy aid supplied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who took a road, from home forth issuing, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She met the Grecian emperor’s youthful heir;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo that, one by one, dispatched his train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of followers, far and wide, through every bourn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And afterwards, in person went in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To find the warrior of the unicorn.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wise enchantress, that will sell and rein,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had on that day equipt a demon, borne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him, in likeness of a hackney horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Constantine’s son encountered in her course.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If such as your ingenuous mien” (she cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Leo) “is your soul’s nobility,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And corresponding with your fair outside</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your inward goodness and your courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some help, some comfort, sir, for one provide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In whom the best of living knights we see;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, save ye help and comfort quickly lend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is little distant from his latter end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The best of knights will die of all, who don,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or e’er donned sword and buckler, the most fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gentle of all warriors that are gone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or who throughout the world yet living are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And simply for a courteous deed, if none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall comfort to the youthful sufferer bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then come, sir, for the love of Heaven, and try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If any counsel succour may supply.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It suddenly came into Leo’s mind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight of whom she parlayed was that same,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom throughout all the land he sought to find,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seeking whom, he now in person came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that obeying her that would persuade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such pious work, he spurred behind the dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thither led (nor tedious was the way)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where nigh reduced to death the stripling lay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They found Rogero fasting from all food</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For three long days, so broken down; with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight could but upon his feet have stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To fall, albeit unpushed, to ground again.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With helm on head, and with his faulchion good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begirt, he lay reclined in plate and chain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pillow of his buckler had he made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the white unicorn was seen portrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>There thinking what an injury he had done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his lady love⁠—how ingrate, how untrue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her had been⁠—not simple grief alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">O’erwhelmed him, to such height his fury grew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bit his hands and lips; while pouring down</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His cheeks, the tears unceasing ran, and through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The passion that so wrapt his troubled sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Leo nor Melissa heard the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor therefore interrupts he his lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor checks his sighs, nor checks his trickling tears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Young Leo halts, to hear his speech intent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lights from his courser, and towards him steers:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He knows that of the sorrows which torment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love is the cause; but yet from nought appears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who is the person that such grief hath bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For by Rogero this remains unsaid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Approaching nearer and yet nearer, now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fronts the weeping warrior, face to face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Greets with a brother’s love, and stooping low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His neck encircles with a fast embrace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the lamenting Child I know not how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is liked his sudden presence in that place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fears annoy or trouble at his hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lest he should his wish for death withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him with the sweetest words young Leo plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the warmest love that he could show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Let it not irk thee,” to the Child he cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“To tell the cause from whence thy sorrows flow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For few such desperate evils man betide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that there is deliverance from his woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that the cause be known; nor he bereft</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hope should ever be, so life be left.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Much grieve I thou wouldst hide thyself from me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That known me for thy faithful friend and true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only now I am so bound to thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That I the knot can never more undo;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But even from the beginning, when to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy deadly foeman I had reason due.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hope then that I will succour thee with pelf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With friends, with following, and with life itself.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor shun to me thy sorrow to explain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I beseech thee leave to me to try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If wealth avail to free thee from thy pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Art, cunning, open force, or flattery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If my assistance is employed in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The last relief remains to thee to die:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But be content awhile this deed to shun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till all that thou canst do shall first be done.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He said; and with such forceful prayer appealed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So gently and benignly soothed his moan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That good Rogero could not choose but yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose heart was not of iron or of stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who deemed, unless he now his lips unsealed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should a foul discourteous deed have done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fain would have replied, but made assay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet twice or thrice, ere words could find their way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My lord, when known for what I am (and me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now shalt thou know),” he made at last reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I wot thou, like myself, content wilt be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply more content, that I should die.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know me for him so hated once by thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero who repaid that hate am I;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now ’tis many days since with intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of putting thee to death from court I went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Because I would not see my promised bride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne off by thee; in that Duke Aymon’s love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And favour was engaged upon thy side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, for man purposes, and God above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disposes, thy great courtesy, well tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a sore need, my fixt resolve did move.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor only I renounced the hate I bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But purposed to be thine for evermore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What time I as Rogero was unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou madest suit I would obtain for thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Lady Bradamant; which was all one</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to demand my heart and soul from me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether thy wish I rather than mine own</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sought to content, thou hast been made to see.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thine is the lady; her in peace possess;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far more than mine I prize thy happiness.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Content thee, that deprived of her, as well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I should myself of worthless life deprive;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For better I without a soul could dwell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than without Bradamant remain alive.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And never while these veins with life-blood swell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Canst thou with her legitimately wive:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For vows erewhile have been between us said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor she at once can with two husbands wed.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So filled is gentle Leo with amaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he the stranger for Rogero knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lips and brow unmoved, with steadfast gaze</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rooted feet, he like a statue shows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like statue more than man, which votaries raise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In churches, for acquittance of their vows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He deems that courtesy of so high a strain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never done nor will be done again;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And that he him doth for Rogero know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only that goodwill he bore whilere</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Abates not, but augments his kindness so,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That no less grieves the Grecian cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than good Rogero for Rogero’s woe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this, as well as that he will appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deservedly an emperor’s son⁠—although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other things outdone⁠—he will not be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Defeated in the race of courtesy;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And says, “That day my host was overthrown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, by thy wond’rous valour, though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I had thee at despite, if I had known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou was Rogero, as I know it now,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So me thy virtue would have made thine own,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As then it made me, knowing not my foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hatred from my bosom would have chased,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with my present love have straight replaced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That I Rogero hated, ere I knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou was Rogero, will I not deny.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But think not that I further would pursue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hatred that I bore thee; and had I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When thee I from thy darksome dungeon drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descried the truth, as this I now descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such treatment shouldst thou then have had, as thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shalt have from me, to thine advantage, now;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if I willingly had done so then,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When not, as I am now, obliged to thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How much more gladly should I now; and when,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not doing so, I should with reason be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deemed most ungrateful amid ingrate men;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since thou foregoest thine every good for me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But I to thee restore thy gift, and, more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glady than I received it, this restore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The damsel more to thee than me is due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And though for her deserts I hold her dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If that fair prize some happier mortal drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I think not I my vital thread should shear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would I by thy death be free to woo:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from the hallowed bands of wedlock clear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherein the lady hath to thee been tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I might possess her as my lawful bride.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not only Bradamant would I forego,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But whatsoe’er I in the world possess;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rather forfeit life than ever know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That grief, through me, should such a knight oppress.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me is thy distrust great cause of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That since thou couldst dispose of me no less</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than of thyself, thou⁠—rather than apply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me for succour⁠—wouldst of sorrow die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These words he spake, and more to that intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too tedious in these verses to recite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Refuting evermore such argument</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As might be used in answer by the knight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who said, at last, “I yield, and am content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To live; but how can I ever requite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The obligation, which by me is owed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thee that twice hast life on me bestowed?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Melissa generous wine and goodly cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither bade carry, in a thought obeyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And comforted the mourning cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would have sunk without her friendly aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile the sound of steeds Frontino’s ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had reached, and thither had he quickly made:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him Leo’s squires at his commandment caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And saddled, and to good Rogero brought;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who, though by Leo helped, with much ado</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And labour sore the gentle courser scaled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wasted was the vigour which some few</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short days before, in fighting field, availed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To overthrow a banded host, and do</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The deeds he did, in cheating armour mailed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departing thence, ere they had measured more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than half a league, they reached an abbey hoar:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Wherein what of that day was yet unworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They past, the morrow, and succeeding day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the warrior of the unicorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His vigour had recruited by the stay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, Leo, and Melissa then return</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Charles’s royal residence; where lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An embassy, arrived the eve before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from the Bulgars’ land a message bore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since they that had for king proclaimed the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besought Rogero thither to repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through these their envoys deeming they would light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On him in Charles’s court, where they should swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fidelity, and yield to him his right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he from them the crown receive and wear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s squire who served this band to steer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has published tidings of the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He of the fight has told which at Belgrade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile Rogero for the Bulgars won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How Leo and his sire were overlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all their army slaughtered and undone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherefore the Bulgars him their king had made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their royal line excluding from the throne:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then how Ungiardo took the warrior brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him to cruel Theodora gave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He speaks with that of certain news, which say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“How good Rogero’s jailer was found dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prison broke and prisoner away:”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of what became of him was nothing said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Towards the city by a secret way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Nor was his visage seen) Rogero sped.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, on the following morning, and his friend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leo, to Charles’s court together wend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Charles’ court he wends; the bird he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of gold with its two heads⁠—of crimson hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its field⁠—and that same vest and ensigns wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As was erewhile devised between the two;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such as in the listed fight before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His bruised and battered armour was in shew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that they quickly knew the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From him that strove with Bradamant whilere.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In royal ornaments and costly gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unarmed, beside him doth young Leo fare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A worthy following and of high renown</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before, behind him, and about him are.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bowed to Charlemagne, who from his throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had risen to do honour to the pair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then holding still Rogero by the hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So spake, while all that warrior closely scanned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Behold the champion good, that did maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From dawn till fall of day the furious fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And since by Bradamant nor taken, slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor forced beyond the barriers was the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He is assured his victory is plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dread sir, if he your edict reads aright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he hath won the lady for his wife:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So comes to claim the guerdon of the strife.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Besides that by your edict’s tenor none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him can to the damsel lift his eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Is she deserved by deeds of valour done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What other is so worthy of the prize?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Should she by him that loves her best be won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None passes him, nor with the warrior vies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he is here to fight against all foes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That would in arms his right in her oppose.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>King Charlemagne and all his peerage stand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amazed, who well believed the Grecian peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With Bradamant had striven with lifted brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fight, and not that unknown cavalier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marphisa, thither borne amid the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That crowded round the royal chair to hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hardly till Leo made an ending staid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then prest before the listening troop, and said:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Since here Rogero is not, to contest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bride’s possession with the stranger knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest he, as undefended, be opprest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And forfeit so without dispute his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On his behalf I undertake this quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—His sister I⁠—against whatever wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall here assert a claim to Bradamant,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or more desert than good Rogero vaunt.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She spake this with such anger and disdain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many surmised amid the assistant crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, without waiting leave from Charlemagne,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What she had threatened she forthwith would do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer Leo deemed it time to feign;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from Rogero’s head the helm withdrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to Marphisa, “For himself to speak,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold him here and ready!” cried the Greek.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As looked old Aegeus at the accursed board,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-577" id="noteref-577" epub:type="noteref">577</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing it was his son to whom⁠—so willed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wicked consort⁠—that Athenian lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had given the juice from deadly drugs distilled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he, if he had recognized his sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though but a little later, would have killed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So looked Marphisa when, disclosed to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in the stranger knight Rogero knew;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And ran forthwith to clip the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could unclasp her arms: with loving show</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Charlemagne, Roland, and Rinaldo, here</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there, fix friendly kisses on his brow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor him Sir Dudon, nor Sir Olivier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor King Sobrino can caress enow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor paladin nor peer, amid the crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wearies of welcoming that warrior true.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Leo, who well can play the spokesman, now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That warlike band hath ceased to clip the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tells before Charles and all that audience, “how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero’s daring, how Rogero’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Albeit to his good squadron’s scathe and woe⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which at Belgrade he witnessed in that fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So moved him that they overweighed all harms</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflicted on him by the warrior’s arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So that to her Rogero being brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would all havoc of the youth have made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He setting all his family at nought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had out of durance vile the knight conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how Rogero, that the rescue wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Leo might be worthily repaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did that high courtesy; which can by none,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ever were or e’er will be, outdone;”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And he from point to point continuing, said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That which Rogero had for him achieved;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And after, how by sorrow sore bested,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that to leave his cherished wife he grieved,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had resolved to die, and, almost dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was only by his timely aid relieved;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this he told so movingly, no eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remained, amid those martial many, dry.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So efficaciously he after prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the obstinate Duke Aymon, not alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stubborn sire of Bradamant he swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to forego his settled purpose won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that proud lord in person did persuade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To beg Rogero’s pardon, and his son</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And son-in-law to be beseech the knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus to him his Bradamant was plight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To her, where, of her feeble life in doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in a secret chamber made lament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through many a messenger, with joyful shout</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mickle haste, the happy tidings went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence the warm blood, that stagnated about</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her heart, by her first sorrow thither sent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ebbed at this notice in so full a tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well nigh for sudden joy the damsel died.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of all her vigour is she so foregone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She cannot on her feeble feet rely:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet what her force must needs to you be known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what the damsel’s magnanimity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None doomed to prison, wheel or halter, none</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned some other evil death to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">About whose brows the sable band is tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rejoices more to hear his pardon cried.</span>
			</p>
			<p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the fox waits the motions of the hare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They wait their time for vengeance, and forbear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Besides that oftentimes before the rage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Roland and Rinaldo on them fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though they were calmed by Charles’s counsel sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And common danger from the infidel,</span>

				<span class="i1">Hoping to find the knight, whose shield portrayed</span>

				<br/>

			<p>
				<span>He accepts the realm, by their entreaties won;</span>

				<span class="i1">And, to afford them aid against their foes,</span>

			<p>
				<span>The weird Melissa against the coming night</span>

				<span>She had prepared the genial, fruitful bed,</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In peace they sit in council at his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Together armed, the serpent-banner spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The youth by one unchanging faith is tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him for ever, well or ill bested;</span>

				<span>Him in another quarter you descry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For his Ferrara and her duke in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who by strange proofs doth sift, and certify</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his just brother, vouched by tokens clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The close device of that ill treachery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hatched by those kinsmen whom he held most dear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence justly he becomes that title’s heir,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Rome yet free bade righteous Tully bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Elsewhere in martial panoply he shone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hasting to help the church with lifted blade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With scanty and tumultuous levy gone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against well-ordered host in arms arrayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lo! the coming of that chief alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Affords the priestly band such present aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Extinguished are the fires before they spread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>He came, he saw, he conquered,</em> may be said.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Elsewhere he stands upon his native strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fighting against the mightiest armament,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That whensoever against Argive land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or Turkish, from Venetian harbour went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scatters and overthrows the hostile band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And⁠—spoil and prisoners to his brother sent⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing reserves save that unfading bay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The only prize he cannot give away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon those figures gazed the courtly crew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-585" id="noteref-585" epub:type="noteref">585</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But read no meaning in the storied wall:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because there was not any one to shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That these were things hereafter to befall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those fair and quaintly fashioned forms they view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With pleasure, and peruse the scrolls withal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Bradamant, to whom the whole was known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By wise Melissa taught, rejoiced alone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though not instructed in that history</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like gentle Bradamant, the affianced knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remembers how amid his progeny</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atlantes often praised this Hippolyte.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Who faithfully could verse such courtesy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Charlemagne vouchsafed to every wight?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With various games that solemn feast was cheered,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And charged with viands aye the board appeared.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who is a valiant knight, is here descried;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For daily broke a thousand lances lay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Singly to combat or in troops they ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On horseback or afoot, they mix in fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthiest of all Rogero is espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who always conquers, jousting night and day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so, in wrestling, dance, and every deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still from its rivals bears away the meed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On the last day, when at their festive cheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was seated solemnly the assembled band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where at Charles’ left was placed the wedded peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Bradamant upon his better hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across the fields an armed cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of semblance haughty, and of stature grand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was seen to ride towards the royal table;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself and courser wholly clothed in sable.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The King of Argier he; that for the scorn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Received from her, when on the bridge he fell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Never to clothe himself in arms had sworn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor draw the faulchion nor bestride the sell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he had like an anchoret outworn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A year and month and day in lowly cell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So to chastise themselves for such like crimes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were cavaliers accustomed in those times.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Albeit of Charles and Agramant the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had heard the several fortunes while away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to foreswear himself, he armed no more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if in nought concerned in that affray:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when the year and month were wholly o’er,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wholly past was the succeeding day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With other courser, harness, sword, and lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king betook him to the court of France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He neither lighted from his horse, nor bowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His head; and, without sign of reverence due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His scorn for Charlemagne by gestures showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the high presence of so fair a crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astound and full of wonder stood the crowd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such license in that haughty man to view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All leave their meat, all leave their talk, to hear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The purpose of the stranger cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Charles and to Rogero opposite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a loud voice, and in proud accent, “I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Am Rodomont of Sarza,” said the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who thee, Rogero, to the field defy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here, before the sun withdraws his light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will prove on thee thine infidelity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that thou, as a traitor to thy lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserv’st not any honour at this board.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Albeit thy felony be plain and clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which thou, as christened, canst not disavow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nathless to make it yet more plain appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This will I prove upon thee; and, if thou</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Canst find a knight to combat for thee here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him will accept;⁠—if one be not enow⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will four, nay six accept; and will maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My words against them all in listed plain.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, with the leave of Pepin’s son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uprose at that appeal, and thus replied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he⁠—nor he alone⁠—but every one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thus impeached him as a traitor, lied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That so he by his king had ever done,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him none could justly blame; and on his side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He was prepared in listed field to shew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He evermore by him had done his due.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He can defend himself; nor need he crave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another warrior’s help that course to run;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ’tis his hope to show him he would have</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enough, perhaps would have too much, of one.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither Orlando and Rinaldo, brave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Olivier, and his white and sable son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-586" id="noteref-586" epub:type="noteref">586</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither good Dudon and Marphisa wend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who fain with that fierce paynim will contend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They tell Rogero that, “as newly wed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The combat he in person should refuse.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Take ye no further pains,” the warrior said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“For such would be for me a foul excuse.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Tartar’s arms were brought, which cut the thread</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of more delay and of all further truce:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With spurs Orlando deck’d the youthful lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">King Charlemagne begirt him with the sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Marphisa and Bradamant in corslet case</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His breast, and clothe him in his other gear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho led his horse of noble race:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir Dudon held his stirrup: far and near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo and Namus made the mob give place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assisted by the Marquis Olivier.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All from the crowded lists they drive with speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Evermore kept in order for such need.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The pale-faced dames and damsels troop, in guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of pigeons round the lists, a timid show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, homeward bound, from fruitful field they rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scared by wide-sweeping winds, which loudly blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid flash and clap; and when the sable skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threat hail and rain, the harvest’s waste and woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A timid troop, they for Rogero fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill matched they deem with that fierce cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So him deemed all the rabble; and so most</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those bold cavalier and barons thought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that they had not yet the memory lost</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of what that paynim had in Paris wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When singly fire and sword the warrior tost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And much of that fair town to ruin brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose signs remained, and yet will long remain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor ever greater havoc plagued that reign.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Bradamant’s heart above those others’ beat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that she deemed the Saracen in might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or valour which in the heart-core hath its seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was of more prowess than the youthful knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor (what oft gives success in martial feat)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with the paynim was the better right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet cannot she her some ill misgivings quell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But upon those that love such fear sits well.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! in her fear for him, how willingly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She battle for Rogero would have done!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If lifeless on the listed field to lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Surer than sure⁠—in fight with Ulien’s son.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-587" id="noteref-587" epub:type="noteref">587</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than one death would she consent to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she withal could suffer more than one,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than she in that unhappy strife</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would see her cherished consort risk his life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But prayer availed not on the damsel’s part</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make Rogero leave to her the quest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She then with mournful face and beating heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood by to view that pair to fight addrest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From right and left the peer and paynim start,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at each other run with lance in rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spears seem ice, as they in shivers fly.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fragments birds, that mount through middle sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont’s lance which smote in the career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon mid-shield, yet harmed it little; so</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perfect was famous Hector’s iron gear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hardened by Vulcan’s hand, and safe from blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well against the shield his levelled spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero guides, and that good buckler⁠—though</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well steeled within and out, with bone between,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nigh a palm in thickness⁠—pierces clean;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And⁠—but his lance resists not that fierce shock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the first assault its splinters fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bits and fragments of the shivered stock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seem fledged with feathers they ascend so high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were his arms hewn from adamantine rock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spear would pierce the paynim’s panoply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And end that battle: but it breaks withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on their croups both staggering coursers fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With bridle and with spur the martial pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raise their proud horses nimbly from the ground;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And having broke their spears, with faulchions bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return, to bandy fierce and cruel wound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wheeling with wondrous mastery, here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The bold and ready coursers in a round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The warriors with their biting swords begin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To try where either’s armour is most thin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont had not that hard dragon-hide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which heretofore had cased the warrior’s breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Nimrod’s trenchant sword was at his side;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor the accustomed helm his temples prest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For on that bridge which spanned the narrow tide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A loser to Dordona’s lady,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-588" id="noteref-588" epub:type="noteref">588</a> vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And arms suspended from the votive stone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He left: as I, meseems, erewhile have shown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Clad was the king in other goodly mail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not like that first panoply secure:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither this, nor that, nor harder scale</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could Balisarda’s deadly dint endure;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against which neither workmanship avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enchantment, temper, nor prime steel and pure.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So here so there Rogero plied his sword,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He more than once the paynim’s armour bored.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When Rodomont beholds in that fierce close</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His widely crimsoned arms, nor can restrain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greater portion of those griding blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From biting to the quick, through plate and chain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with more fury, with more rage o’erflows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than in mid winter the tempestuous main</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flings down his shield, and with both hands outright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lays at Rogero’s helm with all his might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With that excessive force, wherewith the gin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erected in two barges upon Po,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And raised by men and wheels, with deafening din</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descends upon the sharpened piles below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all his might he smote the paladin</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With either hand; was never direr blow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him the charmed helmet helped, or⁠—such its force⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stroke would have divided man and horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As if about to fall, the youthful lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Twice nodded, opening legs and arms; anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont smote, in that he would afford</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foe no time his spirits to renew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then threatened other stroke; but that fine sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bore not such hammering, and in shivers flew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the bold Saracen, bereft of brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in the combat left with unarmed hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But not for this doth Rodomont refrain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He swoops upon the Child, unheeding aught:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So sore astounded is Rogero’s brain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So wholly overclouded is his thought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But him the paynim well awakes again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom by the neck he with strong arm has caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gripes and grapples with such mighty force,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He falls on earth, pulled headlong from his horse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet leaps from earth as nimbly, moved by spleen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far less than shame; for on his gentle bride</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He turned his eyes, and that fair face serene</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now troubled the disdainful warrior spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in sore doubt her champion’s fall had seen;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And well nigh at that sight the lady died.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, quickly to revenge the affront,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clutches his sword and faces Rodomont.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He at Rogero rode, who that rude shock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shunned warily, retiring from his ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as he past, the paynim’s bridle took</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With his left had, and turned his courser round;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with his right he at his rider struck,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he in belly, flank and breast would wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And twice sore anguish felt the monarch, gored</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In flank and thigh, by good Rogero’s sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont, grasping still in that close fight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hilt and pommel of his broken blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Layed at Rogero’s helmet with such might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That him another stroke might have dismayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But good Rogero, who should win of right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seizing his arm, the king so rudely swayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bringing his left his better hand to speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he pulled down the paynim from his steed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through force or skill, so fell the Moorish lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stood his match, I rather ought to say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fell on his feet; because Rogero’s sword</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Gave him, ’twas deemed, advantage in the fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero stands aloof, with wary ward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As fain to keep the paynim king at bay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the wise champion will not let a wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So talk and bulky close with him in fight;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero flank and thigh dyed red beheld,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other wounds; and hoped he would have failed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By little and by little, as it welled;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he finally should have prevailed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hilt and pommel in his fist yet held</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim, which with all his might he scaled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At young Rogero; whom he smote so sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling never was so stunned before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the helmet-cheek and shoulder-bone below</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Child was smit, and left so sore astound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, tripping still and staggering to and fro,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce kept himself from falling to the ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont fain would close upon his foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his foot fails him, weakened by the wound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which pierced his thigh: he overtasked his might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on his kneepan fell the paynim knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero lost no time, and with fierce blows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote him in face and bosom with his brand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hammered, and held the Saracen so close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To ground he bore that champion with his hand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he so stirred himself, again he rose:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He gripes Rogero so, fast locked they stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seconding their huge vigour by address,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They circle one another, shake, and press.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His wounded thigh and gaping flank had sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weakened the vigour of the Moorish king:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero had address; had mickle lore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was greatly practised in the wrestlers’ ring:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He marked his vantage, nor from strife forbore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, where he saw the blood most freely spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where most wounded was the warrior, prest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The paynim with his feet, his arms, and breast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rodomont filled with spite and rage, his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Takes by the neck and shoulders, and now bends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards him, and now pushes from him; now</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raises from earth, and on his chest suspends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whirls here and there and grapples; and to throw</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling sorely in that strife contends.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Collected in himself, Rogero wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To keep his vantage taxing strength and thought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So shifting oft his hold, about the Moor</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms the good and bold Rogero wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against his left flank shoved his breast, and sore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strained him with all his strength engirdled round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At once he past his better leg before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rodomont’s knees and pushed, and from the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplifted high in air the Moorish lord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then hurled him down head foremost on the sward.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such was the shock wherewith King Rodomont</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With battered head and spine the champion smote,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, issuing from his wounds as from a font,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Streams of red blood the crimsoned herbage float.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero, holding Fortune by the front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest he should rise, with one hand griped his throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With one a dagger at his eyes addrest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with his knees the paynim’s belly prest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As sometimes where they work the golden vein</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within Pannonian or Iberian cave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In unexpected ruin whelm the train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By impious avarice there condemned to slave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So with the load they lie opprest, with pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A passage can their prisoned spirit have:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less opprest the doughty paynim lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pinned to the ground in that disastrous fray.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero at his vizor doth present</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His naked poniard’s point, with threatening cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he will slay him, save he yields, content</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To let him live, if he for grace apply.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Rodomont, who rather than be shent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the least deed of shame, preferred to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Writhed, struggled, and with all his vigour tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pull Rogero down, and nought replied.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As mastiff that below the deer-hound lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fixed by the gullet fast, with holding bite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sorely bestirs himself and vainly tries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With lips besmeared with foam and eyes alight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cannot from beneath the conqueror rise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who foils his foe by force, and not despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vainly strives the monarch of Argier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rise from underneath the cavalier.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet Rodomont so twists and strives, he gains</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The freedom of his better arm anew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with the right hand, which his poniard strains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he had drawn his deadly dagger too,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would wound Rogero underneath the reins:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now the wary youth the error knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through which he might have died, by his delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That impious Saracen forthwith to slay;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And smiting twice or thrice his horrid front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Raising as high as he could raise in air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His dagger, buried it in Rodomont;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And freed himself withal from further care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loosed from the more than icy corse, to font</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fetid Acheron, and hell’s foul repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The indignant spirit fled, blaspheming loud;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-589" id="noteref-589" epub:type="noteref">589</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Erewhile on earth so haughty and so proud.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Injurious words and foul reproach are said?</span>
				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not simply a rank sinner, he appears</span>

				<span class="i1">To outrage nature, and his God to dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who his foul hand against a woman rears,</span>

				<span>Such, and no other were those ruffians two,</span>

				<span class="i1">To tell the occasion of her scathe prepared,</span>

				<span class="i1">To the good Paladin, who brought release;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in conclusion thus my story piece.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Of direr deed than ever yet was done,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-76" id="noteref-76" epub:type="noteref">76</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle dame began, “Sir cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Thebes, Mycene, Argos, or upon</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other more savage soil, prepare to hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I believe, that if the circling sun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To these our Scottish shores approach less near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than other land, ’tis that he would eschew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A foul ferocious race that shocks his view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“All times have shown that man has still pursued</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hate, in every clime, his natural foe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to deal death to those who seek our good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Does from too ill and foul a nature flow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, that the truth be better understood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall from first to last the occasion show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why in my tender years, against all right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those caitiffs would have dome me foul despite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ’Tis fitting you should know, that in the spring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of life, I to the palace made resort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There served long time the daughter of the king,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grew with her in growth, well placed in court.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When cruel love, my fortune envying,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Willed I should be his follower and his sport;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made, beyond each Scottish lord and knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albany’s duke find favour in my sight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And for he seemed to cherish me above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All mean; his love a love as ardent bred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We hear, indeed, and see, but do not prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Man’s faith, nor is his bosom’s purpose read.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believing still, and yielding to my love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I ceased not till I took him to my bed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, of all chambers, in that evil hour,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Marked I was in Geneura’s priviest bower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Where, hoarded, she with careful privacy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Preserved whatever she esteemed most rare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There many times she slept. A gallery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From thence projected into the open air.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here oft I made my lover climb to me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (what he was to mount) a hempen stair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When him I to my longing arms would call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From the projecting balcony let fall.</span>

				<span>“For here my passion I as often fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As good Geneura’s absence made me bold;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with the varying season changed her bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shun the burning heat or pinching cold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And Albany, unseen and safely sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For, fronting a dismantled street, and old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was built that portion of the palace bright;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any went that way by day or night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So was for many days and months maintained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By us, in secrecy, the amorous game;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still grew by love, and such new vigour gained,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I in my inmost bosom felt the flame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that he little loved, and deeply feigned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weened not, so was I blinded to my shame:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though, in a thousand certain signs betrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The faithless knight his base deceit bewrayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“After some days, of fair Geneura he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A suitor showed himself; I cannot say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this began before he sighed for me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or, after, of this love he made assay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But judge, alas! with what supremacy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He ruled my heart, how absolute his sway!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since this he owned, and thought no shame to move</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me to assist him in his second love.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Unlike what he bore me, he said, indeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That was not true which he for her displayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But so pretending love, he hoped to speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And celebrate due spousals with the maid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with her royal sire might well succeed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were she consenting to the boon he prayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For after our good king, for wealth and birth</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In all the realm, was none of equal worth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Me he persuades, if through my ministry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He the king’s son-in-law elected were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For I must know he next the king would be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Advanced as high, as subject could repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The merit should be mine, and ever he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So great a benefit in mind would bear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he would cherish me above his bride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than every other dame beside.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I, who to please him was entirely bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who never could or would gainsay his will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon those days alone enjoy content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I find means his wishes to fulfil:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And snatch at all occasions which present</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A mode, his praise and merits to instil:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for my lover with all labour strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And industry, Geneura’s love to gain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With all my heart, in furtherance of his suit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I wrought what could be done, God truly knows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with Geneura this produced no fruit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor her to grace my duke could I dispose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that another love had taken root</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her, whose every fond affection flows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards a gentle knight of courteous lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who sought our Scotland from a distant shore:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And with a brother, then right young, to stay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In our king’s court, came out of Italy:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there of knightly arms made such assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was none in Britain more approved than he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Prized by the king, who (no ignoble pay),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rewarding him like his nobility,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bestowed upon the youth, with liberal hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Burghs, baronies, and castles, woods and land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dear to the monarch, to the daughter still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This lord was dearer, Ariodantes hight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her with affection might his valour fill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But knowledge of his love brought more delight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor old Vesuvius, nor Sicilia’s hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Troy-town, ever, with a blaze so bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Flamed, as with all his heart, the damsel learned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For love of her young Ariodantes burned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The passion which she bore the lord, preferred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And loved with perfect truth and all her heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was the occassion I was still unheard;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor hopeful answer would she e’er impart:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still the more my lover’s suit I stirred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to obtain his guerdon strove with art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him she would censure still, and ever more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was strengthened in the hate she nursed before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My wayward lover often I excite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So vain and bootless an emprize to quit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor idly hope to turn her steadfast sprite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too deeply with another passion smit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And make apparent to the Scottish knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes such a flame had lit</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the young damsel’s breast, that seas in flood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not have cooled one whit her boiling blood.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This Polinesso many times had heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From me (for such the Scottish baron’s name)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well warranted by sight as well as word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How ill his love was cherished by the dame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To see another to himself preferred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only quenched the haughty warrior’s flame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the fond love which in his bosom burned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into despiteful rage and hatred turned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Between Geneura and her faithful knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such discord and ill will he schemed to shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And put betwixt the pair such foul despite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No time should heal the quarrel he had bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bringing such scandal on that damsel bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stain should cleave to her, alive or dead:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, bent to wreck her on this fatal shelf,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Counselled with me, or other but himself.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Dalinda mine,’ he said, his project brewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Dalinda is my name) ‘you needs must know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from the root although the trunk be hewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Successive suckers many times will grow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus my unhappy passion is renewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tenacious still of life, and buds; although</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cut off by ill success, with new increase:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, till I compass my desire, will cease.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Nor hope of pleasure this so much has wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that to compass my design would please;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if not in effect, at least in thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To thrive, would interpose some little ease.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then every time your bower by me is sought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in her bed Geneura slumbers, seize</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What she puts off, and be it still your care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To dress yourself in all her daily wear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Dispose your locks and deck yourself as she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Goes decked; and, as you can, with cunning heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Imitate her; then to the gallery</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You, furnished with the corded stair, shall speed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I shall ascend it in the phantasy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That you are she, of whom you wear the weed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hope, that putting on myself this cheat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I in short time shall quench my amorous heat.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So said the knight; and I, who was distraught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all beside myself, was not aware</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the design, in which he help besought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was manifestly but too foul a snare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in Geneura’s clothes disguised, as taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let down (so oft I used) the corded stair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor I the traitor’s foul deceit perceived,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until the deadly mischief was achieved.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The duke, this while, to Ariodantes’ ears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had these, or other words like these, addressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For leagued in friendship were the cavaliers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till, rivals, they pursued this common quest)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘I marvel, since you are of all my peers</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, whom I must have honoured and caressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And held in high regard, and cherished still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You should my benefits repay so ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I am assured you comprehend and know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mine and Geneura’s love, and old accord;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in legitimate espousal, how</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am about to claim her from my lord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then why disturb my suit, and why bestow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your heart on her who offers no reward?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Heaven, I should respect your claim and place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were your condition mine, and mine your case.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And I,’ cried Ariodantes, ‘marvel more’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(In answer to the Scottish lord) ‘at you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I of her enamoured was, before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gentle damsel ever met your view;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And know, you are assured how evermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We two have loved;⁠—was never love more true⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are certain she alone would share my lot;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And are as well assured she loves you not.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Why have not I from you the same respect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To which, for friendship past, you would pretend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From me; and I should bear you in effect,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If your hope stood more fair to gain its end?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No less than you, to wed her I expect;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if your fortunes here my wealth transcend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As favoured of the king, as you, above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You, am I happy in his daughter’s love.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Of what a strange mistake,’ (to him replied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The duke) ‘your foolish passion is the root!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You think yourself beloved; I, on my side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believe the same; this try we by the fruit.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You of your own proceeding nothing hide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I will tell the secrets of my suit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And let the man who proves least favoured, yield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Provide himself elsewhere, and quit the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘I am prepared, if such your wish, to swear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nothing of what is told me to reveal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will that you assure me, for your share,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You shall what I recount as well conceal.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uniting in the pact, the rival pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their solemn vows upon the Bible seal:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And when they had the mutual promise plighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes first his tale recited.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then plainly, and by simple facts averred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How with Geneura stood his suit, avows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how, engaged by writing and by word,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She swore she would not be another’s spouse.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How, if to him the Scottish king demurred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Virgin austerity she ever vows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other bridal bond for aye eschewed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To pass her days in barren solitude.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then added, how he hoped by worth, which he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had more than once avouched, with knightly brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yet might vouch, to the prosperity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And honour of the king, and of his land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To please so well that monarch, as to be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him accounted worthy of the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his fair child, espoused with his consent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since he in this her wishes would content.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then so concludes⁠—‘I stand upon this ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor I intruder fear, encroaching nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor seek I more; ’tis here my hopes I bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, striving for Geneura’s love, would I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seek surer sign of it than what is found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By God allowed, in wedlock’s lawful tie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other suit were hopeless, am I sure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So excellent she is, and passing pure.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“When Ariodantes had, with honest mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told what reward he hoped should quit his pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">False Polinesso, who before designed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make Geneura hateful to her swain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Began⁠—‘Alas! you yet are far behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My hopes, and shall confess your own are vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And say, as I the root shall manifest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of my good fortune, I alone am blest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘With you Geneura feigns, nor pays nor prizes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your passion, which with hopes and words is fed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, more than this, your foolish love despises:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this to me the damsel oft has said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of hers I am assured; of no surmises,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vain, worthless words, or idle promise bred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And I to you the fact in trust reveal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though this I should in better faith conceal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘There passes not a month, but in that space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three nights, four, six, and often ten, the fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Receives me with that joy in her embrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seems to second so the warmth we share.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This you may witness, and shall judge the case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If empty hopes can with my bliss compare.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then since my happier fortune is above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your wishes, yield, and seek another love.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘This will I not believe,’ in answer cried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes, ‘well assured you lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that you have this string of falsehoods tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To scare me from the dear emprize I try.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But charge, so passing foul, you shall abide,</span>

				<span class="i1">And vouch what you have said in arms; for I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only on your tale place no reliance;</span>

				<span class="i1">But as a traitor hurl you my defiance.’</span>
			</p>

				<span>“To him rejoined the duke, ‘I ween ’twere ill</span>

				<span class="i1">To take the battle upon either part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since surer mean our purpose may fulfill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And if it please, my proof I can impart.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes trembled, and a chill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went through his inmost bones; and sick at heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had he in full believed his rival’s boast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would on the spot have yielded up the ghost.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With wounded heart, and faltering voice, pale face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-77" id="noteref-77" epub:type="noteref">77</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mouth of gall, he answered, ‘When I see</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which the fair Geneura honours thee,</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">Unless my very eyes confirm the tale.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘To warn in due time shall be my care.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Said Polinesso) and so went his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two nights were scarecly passed, ere his repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the known bower was fixed for the assay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ready now to spring his secret snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sought his rival on the appointed day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And him to hide, the night ensuing, prayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the street, which none their habitation made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And to the youth a station overright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The balcony, to which he clambered, shows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes weened, this while, the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would him to seek that hidden place dispose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As one well suited to his fell despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, bent to take his life, this ambush chose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Under the false pretence to make him see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What seemed a sheer impossibility.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To go the peer resolved, but in such guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He should not be with vantage overlaid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And should he be assaulted by surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He need not be by fear of death dismay’d.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had a noble brother, bold and wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First of the court in arms; and on his aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio hight, relied with better heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if ten others fought upon his part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“He called him to his side, and willed him take</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His arms; and to the place at evening led:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet not his secret purpose would be break:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this to him, or other would have read:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him a stone’s throw removed he placed, and spake:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘⁠—Come if thou hearest he cry,’ the warrior said;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘But as thou lovest me (whatsoe’er befall)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Come not and move not, brother, till I call.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Doubt not’ (the valiant brother said) ‘but go;’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither went that baron silently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hid within the lonely house, and low,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Over against my secret gallery.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the other side approached the fraudful foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So pleased to work Geneura’s infamy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, while I nothing of the cheat divine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath my bower renews the wonted sign,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And I in costly robe, in which were set</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fair stripes of gold upon a snowy ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My tresses gathered in a golden net,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shaded with tassels of vermillion round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mimicking fashions, which were only met</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In fair Geneura, at the accustomed sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gallery mount, constructed in such mode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As upon every side my person showed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This while Lurcanio, either with a view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To snares which might beset his brother’s feet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or with the common passion to pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And play the spy on other, where the street</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was darkest, and its deepest shadows threw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed him softly to his dim retreat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And not ten paces from the knight aloof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bestowed himself beneath the self same roof.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Suspecting nought, I seek the balcony,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the same habits which I mentioned, dressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As more than once or twice (still happily)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I did before; meanwhile the goodly vest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was in the moonlight clearly seen, and I,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In aspect not unlike her, in the rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resembling much Geneura’s shape and cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One visage well another might appear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“So much the more, that there was ample space</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between the palace and the ruined row:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence the two brothers, posted in that place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were lightly cheated by the lying show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now put yourself in his unhappy case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And figure what the wretched lover’s woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When Polinesso climbed the stair, which I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast down to him, and scaled the gallery.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Arrived, my arms about his neck I throw,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Weening that we unseen of others meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And kiss his lips and face with loving show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As him I hitherto was wont to greet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he assayed, with more than wonted glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me to caress, to mask his hollow cheat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Led to the shameful spectacle, aghast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other, from afar, viewed all that passed,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And fell into such fit of deep despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He there resolved to die; and, to that end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Planted the pommel of his falchion bare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I’ the ground, its point against his breast to bend.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio, who with marvel by that stair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Saw Polinesso to my bower ascend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But knew not who the wight, with ready speed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sprang forward, when he saw his brother’s deed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And hindered him in that fell agony</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From turning his own hand against his breast.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had the good youth been later, or less nigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his assistance he had vainly pressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, ‘Wretched brother, what insanity.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(He cried) ‘your better sense has dispossessed?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Die for a woman! rather let her kind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be scattered like the mist before the wind!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘Compass her death! ’tis well deserved; your own</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reserve, as due to more illustrious fate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas well to love, before her fraud was shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she, once loved, now more deserves your hate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, witnessed by your eyes, to you is known</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A wanton of what sort you worshipped late.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her fault before the Scottish king to attest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reserve those arms you turn against your breast.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ariodantes, so surprised, forewent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Joined by his brother, the design in show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But resolute to die, in his intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was little shaken: Rising thence to go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He bears away a heart not simply rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But dead and withered with excess of woe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet better comfort to Lurcanio feigns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if the rage were spent which fired his veins.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The morn ensuing, without further say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his good brother, or to man beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the city took his reckless way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With deadly desperation for his guide;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, save the duke and knight, for many a day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was there who knew what moved the youth to ride:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the palace, touching this event,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the realm, was various sentiment.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But eight days past or more, to Scotland’s court</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A traveller came, and to Geneura he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Related tidings of disastrous sort;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That Ariodantes perished in the sea:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drowned of his own free will was the report,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No wind to blame for the calamity!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since from a rock, which over ocean hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the raging waves he headlong sprung;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Who said, before he reached that frowning crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To me, whom he encountered by the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Come with me, that your tongue may manifest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And what betides me to Geneura say;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tell her, too, the occasion of the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which you shall witness without more delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In having seen too much, the occasion lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Happy had I been born without these eyes!’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“By chance, upon a promontory we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were standing, overright the Irish shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, speaking thus on that high headland, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunged from a rock amid the watery roar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw him leap, and left him in the sea;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, hurrying thence, to you the tidings bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Geneura stood amazed, her colour fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, at the fearful tale, remained half dead.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O God! what said, what did she, when alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She on her faithful pillow layed her head!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She beat her bosom, and she tore her gown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in despite her golden tresses shed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repeating often, in bewildered tone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The last sad words which Ariodantes said;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the sole source of such despair, and such</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disaster, was that he had seen too much.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Wide was the rumour scattered that the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had slain himself for grief; nor was the cry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By courtly dame, or courtly cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or by the monarch, heard with tearless eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, above all the rest, his brother dear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was whelmed with sorrow of so deep a dye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, bent to follow him, he well nigh turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His hand against himself, like him he mourned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And many times repeating in his thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was Geneura who his brother slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was to self-destruction moved by nought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But her ill deed, which he was doomed to view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So on his mind the thirst of vengeance wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so his grief his season overthrew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he thought little, graced of each estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To encounter king and people’s common hate;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And, when the throng was fullest in the hall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood up before the Scottish king, and said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">‘Of having marred my brother’s wits withal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir king, and him to his destruction led,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Your daughter only can I guilty call:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For in his inmost soul such sorrow bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The having seen her little chastity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He loathed existence, and preferred to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“ ‘He was her lover; and for his intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was honest, this I seek not, I, to veil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to deserve her by his valour meant</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of thee, if faithful service might avail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But while he stood aloof, and dared but scent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The blossoms, he beheld another scale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scale the forbidden tree with happier boot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bear away from him the wished-for fruit.’</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Then added, how into the gallery came</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Geneura, and how dropped the corded stair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And how into the chamber of the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had climbed a leman of that lady fair;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, for disguise (he knew not hence his name),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had changed his habits, and concealed his hair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in conclusion, vowed that every word</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So said, he would avouch with lance and sword.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“You may divine how grieves the sire, distraught</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With woe, when he the accusation hears:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well that what he never could have thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He of his daughter learns with wondering ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that he knows, if succour be not brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By cavalier, that in her cause appears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who may upon Lurcanio prove the lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He cannot choose, but doom the maid to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I do not think our Scottish law to you</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is yet unknown, which sentences to fire</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The miserable dame, or damsel, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grants other than her wedded lord’s desire.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She dies, unless a champion, good and true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arm on her side before a month expire;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her against the accuser base maintain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unmeriting such death, and free from stain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The king has made proclaim by town and tower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For he believes her wronged, his child to free)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her <em>he</em> shall have to wife, with ample dower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who saves the royal maid from infamy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But each to the other looks, and to this hour</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No champion yet, ’tis said, appears: for he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio, is esteemed so fierce in fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems as he were feared of every knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And evil Fate has willed her brother dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Zerbino, is not here the foe to face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since many months has roved the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proving his matchless worth with spear and mace;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if the valiant champion were more near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such is his courage) or in any place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whither in time the news might be conveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would not fail to bear his sister aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The king, mean time, who would the quest pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by more certain proof than combat, try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If the accuser’s tale be false or true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And she deserve, or merit not, to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrests some ladies of her retinue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, as he weens, the fact can verify.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence I foresaw, that if I taken were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too certain risk the duke and I must share.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That very night I from the palace flee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the duke repair, escaped from court;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, were I taken, make him plainly see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How much it either’s safety would import:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He praised, and bade me of good courage be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for his comfort, prayed me to resort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To a strong castle which he held hard by;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And gave me two to bear me company.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“With what full proofs, sir stranger, you have heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I of my love assured the Scottish peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And clearly can discern, if so preferred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That lord was justly bound to hold me dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mark, in conclusion, what was my reward;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The glorious meed of my great merit hear!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And say if woman can expect to earn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">However well she love, her love’s return.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For this perfidious, foul, ungrateful man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length suspicious of my faith and zeal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And apprehending that his wily plan,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In course of time, I haply might reveal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigned that meanwhile the monarch’s anger ran</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too high, he would withdraw me, and conceal</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within a fortress of his own, where I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Such was his real end) was doomed to die.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For secretly the duke enjoined the guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with me through the gloomy forest went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The worthy guerdon of a faith so tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To slay me; and had compassed his intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But for your ready succour, when I cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behold! what wages love’s poor slaves content.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus to Rinaldo did Dalinda say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As they together still pursued their way.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above all other fortune, to the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was welcome to have found the gentle maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who the whole story of Geneura bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And her unblemished innocence displayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, if he hoped, although accused with right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To furnish the afflicted damsel aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Persuaded of the calumny’s disproof,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He with more courage warred in her behoof.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And for <abbr>St.</abbr> Andrew’s town, with eager speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where was the king with all his family,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And where the single fight, in listed mead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon his daughter’s quarrel, was to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The good Rinaldo pricked, nor spared his steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Until, within an easy distance, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now near the city, met a squire who brought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More recent tidings than the damsel taught:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That thither had repaired a stranger knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To combat in Geneura’s quarrel bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With ensigns strange, not known of living wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since ever close concealed the warrior went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not, since he had been there, had bared to sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His visage, aye within his helmet pent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that the very squire who with him came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swore that he knew not what the stranger’s name.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not far they ride before the walls appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now before the gate their coursers stand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To advance the sad Dalinda was in fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet followed, trusting in Rinaldo’s brand.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gate was shut, and to the porter near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What this implies” Rinaldo makes demand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him was said, the people, one and all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were trooped to see a fight without the wall:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Beyond the city, fought upon accord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between Lurcanio and a stranger knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, on a spacious meadow’s level sward,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pair already had begun the fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The porter opened to Mount Alban’s lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight behind the peer the portal hight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo through the empty city rode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in a hostel first the dame bestowed:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And will that she (he will not long delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek her there) till his return repose;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quickly to the lists pursued his way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the two made that fell exchange of blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And strove and struggled yet in bloody fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio’s heart with vengeful hatred glows</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against Geneura; while that other knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well maintains the quarrel for her right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Six knights on foot within the palisade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stand covered with the corslet’s iron case;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the Duke of Albany arrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne on a puissant steed of noble race:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who there, as lord high-constable obeyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was keeper of the field and of the place,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And joyed Geneura’s peril to espy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With swelling bosom and exulting eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo pierces through the parted swarm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So wide is felt the good Bayardo’s sway,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he who hears the courser come in storm,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Halts not, in his desire to make him way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above is seen Rinaldo’s lofty form,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flower of those who mix in martial fray.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stops his horse before the monarch’s chair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While all to hear the paladin repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Dread sir,” to him the good Rinaldo said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Let not the pair this combat longer ply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since whichsoever of the two falls dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Know, that you let him perish wrongfully:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1"><em>This</em> thinks that he is right, and is misled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vouches the false, and knows not ’tis a lie:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since that which brought his brother to his end,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moves him in causeless battle contend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“<em>That</em>, in pure gentleness, with little care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If what he here maintains be wrong or right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he would preserve a maid so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perils his person in the furious fight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To injured innocence I safety bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the evil man its opposite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But first, for love of God, the battle stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then list, sir king, to what I shall display.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So moved the king the grave authority</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of one who seemed so worthy, by his cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he made sign the battle should not be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Further continued then with sword or spear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom, together with his chivalry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And barons of the realm and others near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rinaldo all the treacherous plot displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Polinesso for Geneura layed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next that he there in arms would testify</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The truth of what he vouched, the warrior cried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">False Polinesso, called, with troubled eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood forth, but daringly the tale denied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the good Rinaldo in reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“By deeds be now the doubtful quarrel tried.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The field was cleared, and, ready armed, the foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without more let, in deadly duel close.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How was the hope to king and people dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The proof might show Geneura innocent!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All trust that God will make the treason clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And show she was accused with foul intent:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Polinesso, greedy and severe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And proud was held, and false and fraudulent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that none there, of all assembled, deemed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It marvel, if the knight such fraud had schemed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>False Polinesso, with a mien distressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pallid cheek, and heart which thickly beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the third trumpet, laid his lance in rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well Rinaldo spurred the knight to meet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And levelled at his evil foeman’s breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eager to finish at a single heat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor counter to his wish was the event;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since through the warrior half his weapon went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him, through his breast, impaled upon the spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than six yards beyond his horse he bore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With speed alighted Mount Albano’s peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ere he rose, unlaced the helm he wore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he for mercy prayed with humble cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unfit to strive in joust or warfare more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, before king and court, with faltering breath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Confessed the fraud which brought him to his death.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He brings not his confession to a close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pangs of death the failing accents drown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The prince, who ended saw his daughter’s woes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Redeemed from death and scorn, her virtue shown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With more delight and rapture overflows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than if he, having lost his kingly crown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then saw it first upon his head replaced;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he good Rinaldo singly graced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when, through his uplifted casque display’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Features, well known before, the king descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His thanks to God with lifted hands he paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he had deigned such succour to provide.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other cavalier, who bared his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unknown of all, upon Geneura’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thither came from far, his aid to impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Looked upon all that passed, and stood apart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him the good king entreated to declare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His name, or, at the least, his visage shew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might grace him with such guerdon fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to his good intent was justly due.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stranger, after long and earnest prayer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lifted to covering casque, and bared to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What in the ensuing canto will appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you are fain the history to hear.</span>

					<span>Ariodantes has, a worthy meed,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meantime Rogero, on the flying steed,</span>

					<span class="i1">Arrives in false Alcina’s empery:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There from a myrtle-tree her every deed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A human myrtle hears, and treachery,</span>

				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>Wretched that evil man who lives in trust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His secret sin is safe in his possession!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since, if nought else, the air, the very dust</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which the crime is buried, makes confession,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-78" id="noteref-78" epub:type="noteref">78</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And oftentimes his guilt compels the unjust,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though sometime unarraigned in worldly session,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be his own accuser, and bewray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So God has willed, deeds hidden from the day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The unhappy Polinesso hopes had nursed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wholly his secret treason to conceal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By taking off Dalinda, who was versed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this, and only could the fact reveal;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And adding thus a second to his first</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Offence, but hurried on the dread appeal,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which haply he had stunned, at least deferred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he to self-destruction blindly spurred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And forfeited estate, and life, and love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of friends at once, and honour, which was more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cavalier unknown, I said above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Long of the king and court entreated sore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length the covering helmet did remove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And showed a visage often seen before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The cherished face of Ariodantes true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of late lamented weeping Scotland through;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Ariodantes, whom with tearful eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His brother and Geneura wept as dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And king, and people, and nobility:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such light his goodness and his valour shed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pilgrim therefore might appear to lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In what he of the missing warrior said.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet was it true that from a headland, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had seen him plunge into the foaming sea.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, as it oft befalls despairing wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who grisly Death desires till he appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But loathes what he had sought, on nearer sight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So painful seems the cruel pass and drear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus, in the sea engulphed, the wretched knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repentant of his deed, was touched with fear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, matchless both for spirit and for hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beat back the billows, and returned to land.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, now despising, as of folly bred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fond desire which did to death impell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence, soaked and dripping wet, his way did tread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And halted at a hermit’s humble cell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And housed within the holy father’s shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There secretly awhile designed to dwell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till to his ears by rumour should be voiced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If his Geneura sorrowed or rejoiced.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At first he heard that, through excess of woe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The miserable damsel well-nigh died:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so abroad the doleful tidings go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas talked of in the island, far and wide:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Far other proof than that deceitful show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to his cruel grief he thought he spied!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next against the fair Geneura heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lurcanio to her sire his charge preferred:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor for his brother felt less enmity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than was the love he lately bore the maid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he too foul, and full of cruelty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed the deed, although for him essayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, hearing after, in her jeopardy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That none appeared to lend the damsel aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because so puissant was Lurcanio’s might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All dreaded an encounter with the knight,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And that who well the youthful champion knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Believed he was so wary and discreet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, had what he related been untrue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He never would have risked so rash a feat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—For this the greater part the fight eschew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fearing in wrongful cause the knight to meet⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ariodantes (long his doubts are weighed)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will meet his brother in Geneura’s aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alas! (he said) I cannot bear to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus by my cause the royal damsel die;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My death too bitter and too dread would be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did I, before my own, her death descry;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For still my lady, my divinity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She is;⁠—the light and comfort of my eye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, right or wrong, I cannot choose but shield,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for her safety perish in the field.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I know I choose the wrong, and be it so!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the cause shall die: nor this would move;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that, alas! my death, as well I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will such a lovely dame’s destruction prove,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To death I with one only comfort go,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if her Polinesso bears her love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her will manifestly be displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hitherto he moves not in her aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And me, so wronged by her, the maid shall view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encounter death in her defence; and he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My brother, who such flames of discord blew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall pay the debt of vengeance due to me.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For well I ween to make Lurcanio rue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Informed of the event) his cruelty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who will have thought to venge me with his brand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And will have slain me with his very hand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He, having this concluded in his thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made new provision of arms, steed, and shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Black was the vest and buckler which he bought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where green and yellow striped the sable field:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-79" id="noteref-79" epub:type="noteref">79</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By hazard found, with him a squire he brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A stranger in that country; and, concealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(As is already told) the unhappy knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against his brother came, prepared for fight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The issue of the event was told above;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How prince and people Ariodantes knew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor less delight the Scottish king did prove</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than when the knight the accuser overthrew:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within himself he thought that never love</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In man was shown so constant and so true;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, though so foully wronged, prepared to stake</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His life against his brother’s for her sake:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And yielding to his natural inclination,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at the suit of all his court beside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And mostly at Rinaldo’s instigation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assigned the youth the damsel as his bride.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Albany’s duchy, now in sequestration,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Late Polinesso’s, who in duel died,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could not be forfeited in happier hour;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since this the monarch made his daughter’s dower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rinaldo for Dalinda mercy won;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who from her fault’s due punishment went free.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, satiate of the world, (and this to shun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel so had vowed) to God will flee:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence, in Denmark’s land, to live a nun,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-80" id="noteref-80" epub:type="noteref">80</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Straight from her native Scotland sailed the sea.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But it is time Rogero to pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on his courser posts the welkin through.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Although Rogero is of constant mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not from his cheek the wonted hues depart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I ween that faster than a leaf i’ the wind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fluttered within his breast the stripling’s heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All Europe’s region he had left behind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In his swift course; and, issuing in that part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passed by a mighty space, the southern sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where great Alcides fixed the sailor’s bound.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-81" id="noteref-81" epub:type="noteref">81</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That hippogryph, huge fowl, and strange to sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears off the warrior with such rapid wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would have distanced, in his airy flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thunder bearing bird of Aether’s king:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other living creature soars such height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him in his mighty swiftness equalling.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I scarce believe that bolt, or lightning flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or darts more swiftly from the parted skies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the huge bird his pinions long had plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In a straight line, without one stoop or bend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, tired of air, with sweeping wheel and wide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Began upon an island to descend;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like that fair region, whither, long unspied<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-82" id="noteref-82" epub:type="noteref">82</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of him, her wayward mood did long offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whilom in vain, through strange and secret sluice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Passed under sea the Virgin Arethuse.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A more delightful place, wherever hurled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the whole air, Rogero had not found:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, had he ranged the universal world,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would not have seen a lovelier in his round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that, where, wheeling wide, the courser furled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His spreading wings, and lighted on the ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Mid cultivated plain, delicious hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Moist meadow, shady bank, and crystal rill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Small thickets, with the scented laurel gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cedar, and orange, full of fruit and flower,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Myrtle and palm, with interwoven spray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pleached in mixed modes, all lovely, form a bower;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, breaking with their shade the scorching ray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Make a cool shelter from the noontide hour.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nightingales among those branches wing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their flight, and safely amorous descants sing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Amid red roses and white lilies there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the soft breezes freshen as they fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Secure the cony haunts, and timid hare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And stag, with branching forehead broad and high.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, fearless of the hunter’s dart or snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feed at their ease, or ruminating lie;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While, swarming in those wilds, from tuft or steep</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dun deer or nimble goat, disporting, leap.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the hyppogryph above the island hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had approached so nigh that landscape fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, if his rider from the saddle sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He might the leap with little danger dare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero lit the grass and flowers among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But held him, lest he should remount the air:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to a myrtle, nigh the rolling brine,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made fast, between a bay-tree and a pine.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And there, close-by where rose a bubbling fount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Begirt the fertile palm and cedar-tree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He drops the shield, the helmet from his front</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Uplifts, and, either hand from gauntlet free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now turning to the beach, and now the mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Catches the gales which blow from hill or sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, with a joyous murmur, lightly stir</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lofty top of beech, or feathery fir:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, now, to bathe his burning lips he strains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now dabbles in the crystal wave, to chase</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The scorching heat which rages in his veins,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Caught from the heavy corslet’s burning case.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor is it marvel if the burden pains;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No ramble his in square or market-place!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Three thousand miles, without repose, he went,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still, at speed, in ponderous armour pent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the courser by the myrtle’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he left stabled in the cool retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Started at something in the wood descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scared by I know not what; and in his heat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So made the myrtle shake where he was tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He brought a shower of leaves about his feet;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He made the myrtle shake and foliage fall,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, struggling, could not loose himself withal.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As in a stick to feed the chimney rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where scanty pith ill fills the narrow sheath,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vapour, in its little channel pent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Struggles, tormented by the fire beneath;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, till its prisoned fury find a vent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is heard to hiss and bubble, sing and seethe:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So the offended myrtle inly pined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Groaned, murmured, and at last unclosed its rind:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And hence a clear, intelligible speech<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-83" id="noteref-83" epub:type="noteref">83</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus issued, with a melancholy sound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“If, as thy cheer and gentle presence teach,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou courteous art and good, his reign unbound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Release me from this monster, I beseech:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Griefs of my own inflict sufficient wound:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor need I, compassed with such ills about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Other new pain to plague me from without.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At the first sound, Rogero turns to see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence came the voice, and, in unused surprise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stands, when he finds it issues from the tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And swiftly to remove the courser hies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, with a face suffused with crimson, he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In answer to the groaning myrtle, cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Pardon! and, whatsoe’er thou art, be good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spirit of man, or goddess of the wood!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Unweeting of the wonderous prodigy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of spirit, pent beneath the knotty rind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To your fair leaf and living body I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have done this scathe and outrage undesigned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not the less for that, to me reply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What art thou, who, in rugged case confined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dost live and speak? And so may never hail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From angry heaven your gentle boughs assail!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And if I now or ever the despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I did thee can repair, or aid impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, by that lady dear, my promise plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in her keeping has my better part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To strive with word and deed, till thou requite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The service done with praise and grateful heart.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero said; and, as he closed his suit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That gentle myrtle shook from top to root.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next drops were seen to stand upon the bark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As juice is sweated by the sapling-spray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">New-severed, when it yields to flame and spark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sometime in vain kept back and held at bay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next the voice began; “My story dark,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forced by thy courteous deed, I shall display;⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What once I was⁠—by whom, through magic lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changed to a myrtle on the pleasant shore.</span>

				<span>“A peer of France, Astolpho was my name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-84" id="noteref-84" epub:type="noteref">84</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whilom a paladin, sore feared in fight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cousin I was to two of boundless fame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando and Rinaldo. I by right</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More dames than one my beauty served to warm,</span>

			<p>
				<span>“Returning from those isles, whose eastern side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The billows of the Indian ocean beat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where good Rinaldo and more knights beside</span>
				<br/>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Pursuing thus our rugged journey, we</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came (such our evil doom) upon the strand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where stood a mansion seated by the sea:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Puissant Alcina owned the house and land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We found her, where, without her dwelling, she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had taken on the beach her lonely stand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And though nor hook nor sweeping net she bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What fish she willed, at pleasure drew to shore.</span>

			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“There we behold a mighty whale, of size<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-87" id="noteref-87" epub:type="noteref">87</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hugest yet in any water seen:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than eleven paces, to our eyes,</span>

				<span class="i1">His back appears above the surface green:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (for still firm and motionless he lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such the distance his two ends between)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We all are cheated by the floating pile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And idly take the monster for an isle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Alcina made the ready fish obey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By simple words and by mere magic lore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Born with Morgana<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-88" id="noteref-88" epub:type="noteref">88</a>⁠—but I cannot say</span>

				<span class="i1">If at one birth, or after or before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as seen, my aspect pleased the fay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who showed it in the countenance she wore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then wrought with art, and compassed her intent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To part me from the friends with whom I went.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“She came towards us with a cheerful face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With graceful gestures, and a courteous air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said: ‘So you my lodging please to grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sir cavalier, and will with me repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You shall behold the wonders of my chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And note the different sorts of fish I snare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shaggy or smooth, or clad in scales of light,</span>

				<span class="i1">And more in number than the stars of night:</span>

			<p>
				<span>“ ‘And would you hear a mermaid sing so sweet,</span>

				<span class="i1">That the rude sea grows civil at her song,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wont at this hour her music to repeat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(With that she showed the monster huge and long</span>

				<span class="i1">—I said it seemed an island⁠—as her seat)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pass with me where she sings the shoals among.’</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, that was always wilful, at her wish,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I now lament my rashness, climb the fish.</span>

			<p>
				<span>“To Dudon and Rinaldo’s signal blind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I go, who warn me to misdoubt the fay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With laughing face Alcina mounts behind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving the other two beside the bay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The obedient fish performs the task assigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And through the yielding water works his way.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repentant of my deed, I curse the snare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too far from land my folly to repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“To aid me swam Mount Alban’s cavalier,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-89" id="noteref-89" epub:type="noteref">89</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was nigh drowned amid the waves that rise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For a south-wind sprang up that, far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Covered with sudden darkness seas and skies.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I know not after what befell the peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while Alcina to console me tries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all that day, and night which followed, me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Detained upon that monster in mid-sea,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Till to this isle we drifted with the morn,</span>

				<span class="i1">Of which Alcina keeps a mighty share;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that usurper from a sister torn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was her father’s universal heir:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that she only was in wedlock born,</span>

			<p>
				<span>“As these are practised in iniquity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And full of every vice and evil art;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So she, who ever lives in chastity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wisely on better things has set her heart.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence, leagued against her, in conspiracy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those others are, to drive her from her part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than once their armies have o’errun</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her realm, and towns above a hundred won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor at this hour a single span of ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would Logistilla (such her name) command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that a mountain here, and there a sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Protects the remnant from the invading band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis thus the mountain and the river bound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">England, and part it from the Scottish land.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet will the sisters give their foe no rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till of her scanty remnant dispossest.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Because in wickedness and vice were bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pair, as chaste and good they loath the dame.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, to return to what I lately said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to relate how I a plant became;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me, full of love, the kind Alcina fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With full delights; nor I a weaker flame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For her, within my burning heart did bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beholding her so courteous and so fair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Clasped in her dainty limbs, and lapt in pleasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I weened that I each separate good had won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to mankind is dealt in different measure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little or more to some, and much to none.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I evermore contemplated my treasure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor France nor aught beside I thought upon:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In her my every fancy, every hope</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Centered and ended as their common scope.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“By her I was as much beloved, or more;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor did Alcina now for other care;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She left her every lover; for before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others, in truth, the fairy’s love did share:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I was her close adviser evermore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And served by her, where they commanded were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With me she counselled, and to me referred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, night nor day, to other spake a word.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Why touch my wounds, to aggravate my ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, alas! without the hope of cure?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why thus the good possessed remember still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the cruel penance I endure?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When kindest I believed Alcina’s will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fondly deemed my happiness secure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From me the heart she gave, the fay withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yielded all her soul to love more new.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Late I discerned her light and fickle bent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still loving and unloving at a heat:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two months, I reigned not more, no sooner spent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than a new paramour assumed my seat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And me, with scorn, she doomed to banishment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From her fair grace cast out. ’Tis then I weet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I share a thousand lovers’ fate, whom she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had to like pass reduced, all wrongfully.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And these, because they should not scatter bruits,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roaming the world, of her lascivious ways,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, up and down the fruitful soil, transmutes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To olive, palm, or cedar, firs or bays.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, as you see me changed, Alcina roots;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While this transformed into a monster strays;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another melts into a liquid rill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As suits that haughty fairy’s wanton will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Thou, too, that to this fatal isle art led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By way unwonted and till now unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That some possessor of the fairy’s bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May be for thee transformed to wave or stone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou shalt, with more than mortal pleasures fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have from Alcina seigniory and throne;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But shalt be sure to join the common flock,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Transformed to beast or fountain, plant or rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I willingly to thee this truth impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not that I hope with profit to advise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet ’twill be better, that informed, in part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her false ways, she harm not by surprise.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perhaps, as faces differ, and in art</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wit of man an equal difference lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou may’st some remedy perchance apply</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the ill, which thousand others could not fly.”</span>

			<p>
				<span>The good Rogero, who from Fame had learned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he was cousin to the dame he wooed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lamented much the sad Astolpho, turned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his true form, to barren plant and rude:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for her love, for whom so sore he burned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would gladly serve the stripling if he cou’d:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, witless how to give the wished relief,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might but console the unhappy warrior’s grief.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As best he could, he strove to soothe his pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then asked him, if to Logistil’s retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were passage, whether over hill or plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he might so eschew Alcina’s seat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“There was a way,” the myrtle said again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—“But rough with stones, and rugged to the feet⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he, some little further to the right,</span>

				<span>“But that he must not think he shall pursue</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fierce, who serve as rampart to the fay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That block the road against the stranger, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would break her bounds, and the deserter stay.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero thanked the tree for all, and taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Departed thence with full instructions fraught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The courser from the myrtle he untied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the bridle led behind him still;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would he, as before, the horse bestride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest he should bear him off against his will:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He mused this while how safely he might find</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A passage to the land of Logistil;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm in his purpose every nerve to strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest empire over him Alcina gain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He to remount the steed, and through the air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To spur him to a new career again</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now thought; but doubted next, in fear to fare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worse on the courser, restive to the rein.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“No, I will win by force the mountain stair,”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero said; (but the resolve was vain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor by the beach two miles his way pursued,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere he Alcina’s lovely city viewed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A lofty wall at distance meets his eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which girds a spacious town within its bound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seems as if its summit touched the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all appears like gold from top to ground.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here some one says it is but alchemy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—And haply his opinion is unsound⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply he more wittily divines:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For me, I deem it gold because it shines.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When he was nigh the city-walls, so bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The world has not their equal, he the straight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And spacious way deserts, the way which dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Across the plain, conducted to the gate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by that safer road upon the right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strains now against the mountain; but, in wait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Encounters soon the crowd of evil foes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who furiously the Child’s advance oppose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Was never yet beheld a stranger band,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-90" id="noteref-90" epub:type="noteref">90</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of mien more hideous, or more monstrous shape.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Formed downwards from neck like men, he scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some with the head of cat, and some of ape;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With hoof of goat that other stamped the sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While some seemed centaurs, quick in fight and rape;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Naked, or mantled in outlandish skin.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These doting sires, those striplings bold in sin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This gallops on a horse without a bit;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This backs the sluggish ass, or bullock slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These mounted on the croup of centaur sit:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those perched on eagle, crane, or estridge, go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some male, some female, some hermaphrodit’,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These drain the cup and those the bungle blow.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One bore a corded ladder, one a book;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One a dull file, or bar of iron shook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The captain of this crew, which blocked the road,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared, with monstrous paunch and bloated face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who a slow tortoise for a horse bestrode,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That passing sluggishly with him did pace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Down looked, some here, some there, sustained the load,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he was drunk, and kept him in his place.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some wipe his brows and chin from sweat which ran,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And others with their vests his visage fan.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One, with a human shape and feet, his crest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fashioned like hound, in neck and ears and head,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bayed at the gallant Child with angry quest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To turn him to the city whence he fled.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That will I never, while of strength possessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To brandish this,” the good Rogero said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that his trenchant faulchion he displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pointed at him full the naked blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That monster would have smote him with a spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But swiftly at his foe Rogero sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thrust at his paunch, and drove his faulchion sheer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through his pierced back a palm; his buckler flung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before him, and next sallied there and here:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But all too numerous was the wicked throng.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now grappled from behind, now punched before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He stands, and plies the crowd with warfare sore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One to the teeth, another to the breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that foul race he cleft; since no one steeled</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In mail, his brows with covering helmet dressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or fought, secured by corslet or by shield;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet is he so upon all quarters pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it would need the Child, to clear the field,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to keep off the wicked crew which swarms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than Briareus’ hundred hands and arms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>If he had thought the magic shield to show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(I speak of that the necromancer bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which dazed the sight of the astonished foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left at his saddle by the wizard Moor)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That hideous band, in sudden overthrow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Blinded by this, had sunk the knight before.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But haply he despised such mean as vile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And would prevail by valour, not by guile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This as it may: the Child would meet his fate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere by so vile a band be prisoner led;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, lo! forth issuing from the city’s gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose wall appeared like shining gold I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two youthful dames, not born in low estate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If measured by their mien and garb, nor bred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By swain, in early wants and troubles versed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But amid princely joys in palace nursed!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>On unicorn was seated either fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A beast than spotless ermine yet more white;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So lovely were the damsels, and so rare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their garb, and with such graceful fashion dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he who closely viewed the youthful pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would need a surer sense than mortal sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To judge between the two. With such a mien</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embodied <b>grace</b> and <b>beauty</b> would be seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Into the mead rode this and the other dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the foul crew opposed the Child’s retreat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rabble scattered as the ladies came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with extended hand the warrior greet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, with a kindling visage, red with shame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thanked the two damsels for their gentle feat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was content upon their will to wait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With them returning to that golden gate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above, a cornice round the gateway goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Somedeal projecting from the colonnade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In which is not a single part but glows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With rarest gems of India overlaid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Propp’d at four points, the portal did repose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On columns of one solid diamond made.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether what met the eye was false or true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was never sight more fair or glad to view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Upon the sill and through the columns there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ran young and wanton girls, in frolic sport;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who haply yet would have appeared more fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had they observed a woman’s fitting port.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All are arrayed in green,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-91" id="noteref-91" epub:type="noteref">91</a> and garlands wear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the fresh leaf. Him these in courteous sort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many proffers and fair mien entice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And welcome to this opening Paradise:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For so with reason I this place may call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, it is my belief, that Love had birth;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where life is spent in festive game and ball,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still the passing moments fleet in mirth.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here hoary-headed Thought ne’er comes at all,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor finds a place in any bosom. Dearth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor yet Discomfort, never enter here,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Plenty fills her horn throughout the year.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here, where with jovial and unclouded brow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Glad April seems to wear a constant smile,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Troop boys and damsels: One, whose fountains flow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the green margin sings in dulcet style;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Others, the hill or tufted tree below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In dance, or no mean sport the hours beguile.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While this, who shuns the revellers’ noisy cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tells his love sorrows in his comrade’s ear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Above the laurel and pine-tree’s height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through the tall beech and shaggy fir-tree’s spray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sport little loves, with desultory flight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, at their conquests made, rejoiced and gay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These, with the well-directed shaft, take sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At hearts, and those spread nets to catch their prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One wets his arrows in the brook which winds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And one on whirling stone the weapon grinds.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To good Rogero here was brought a steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Puissant and nimble, all of sorel hue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was caparisoned with costly weed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Broidered with gold, and jewels bright to view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other winged horse, which, at his need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Obedient to the Moorish wizard flew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The friendly damsels to a youth consigned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who led him at a slower pace behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>That kindly pair who, by the wicked band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Offended fate, had saved the youthful knight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wicked crew, that did the Child withstand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he the road had taken on his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exclaimed, “Fair sir, your works already scanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By us, who are instructed of your might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embolden us, in our behalf, to pray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">You will the prowess of your arm assay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“We soon shall reach a bottom which divides</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The plain into two parts: A cruel dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A bridge maintains, which there a stream bestrides,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eriphila the savage beldam’s name;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who cheats, and robs, and scathes, whoever rides</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the other shore, a giantess in frame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who has long poisonous teeth her prey to tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scratches with her talons like a bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Besides that she infests the public way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which else were free; she often ranging through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All this fair garden, puts in disarray</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This thing or that. Of the assassin crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That people who without the portal gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lately with brutal rage assaulted you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Many her sons, the whole her followers call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As greedy and inhospitable all.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For you not only her I would assail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But do a hundred battles, well content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then of my person, where it may avail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispose (Rogero said) to you intent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Silver and land to conquer, plate or mail</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I swear not, I, in warlike cuirass pent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But to afford my aid to others due;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, most of all, to beauteous dames like you.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Their grateful thanks the ladies, worthily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bestowed on such a valiant champion, paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They talking thus the bridge and river see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at her post the haughty dame arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Sapphire and emerald decked the panoply)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In arms of gold: but I awhile delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till other strain the issue of the fray.</span>

					<span>Rogero, as directed by the pair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The giantess Eriphila o’erthrows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That done, he to Alcina’s labyrinth, where</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than one knight is tied and prisoned, goes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him Melissa sage the secret snare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And remedy for that grave evil shows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he, by her advised, with downcast eye,</span>

				<span>The traveller, he, whom sea or mountain sunder<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-92" id="noteref-92" epub:type="noteref">92</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From his own country, sees things strange and new;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That the misjudging vulgar, which lies under</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mist of ignorance, esteems untrue:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rejecting whatsoever is a wonder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unless ’tis palpable and plain to view:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence inexperience, as I know full well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will yield small credence to the tale I tell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But this be great or small, I know not why</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rabble’s silly judgement I should fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Convinced <em>you</em> will not think the tale a lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In whom the light of reason shines so clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hence to you it is I only try</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fruit of my fatigues to render dear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I ended where Eriphila in guard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of bridge and stream was seen, the passage barred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of finest metal was her armour bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With gems of many colours overspread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tawny jacinth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-93" id="noteref-93" epub:type="noteref">93</a> yellow chyrsolite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The emerald green of hue, and ruby red.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mounted, but not on palfrey, for the fight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In place of that, she on a wolf had sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sped on a wolf towards the pass; and rode</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On sell, that rich beyond all custom showed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No larger wolf, I ween, Apulia roams;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-94" id="noteref-94" epub:type="noteref">94</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More huge than bull, unguided by her hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Although upon no bit the monster foams,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Docile, I know not why, to her command.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The accursed Plague, arrayed in surcoat, comes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Above her arms, in colour like the sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, saving in its dye, was of the sort</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which bishops and which prelates wear at court.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-95" id="noteref-95" epub:type="noteref">95</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The giantess’s crest and shield appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For ensign, decked with swoln and poisonous toad.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her the two damsels to the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before the bridge, prepared for battle, showed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threatening, as wont to some, with levelled spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To do the warrior scorn and bar the road.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding him turn, she to Rogero cries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A lance he takes, and threats her and defies.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-96" id="noteref-96" epub:type="noteref">96</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As quick and daring, the gigantic Pest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spurred her wolf, seated well for that dread game:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In mid career she laid her lance in rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made earth quake beneath her as she came;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet at the encounter fierce the champaign pressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For underneath the casque, with steadfast aim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So hard Rogero smote her, that he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beldam backward six good yards and more:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And came already with his lifted blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drawn for that end, to take her haughty head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him an easy task; for she was laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Among the grass and flowers, like one that’s dead.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, “ ’Tis enough that she is vanquished,” said</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The pair, “No further press thy vengeance dread.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sheathe, courteous cavalier, thy sword anew:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-97" id="noteref-97" epub:type="noteref">97</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pass we the river, and our way pursue.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Along the path, which through a forest lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Roughish and somedeal ill to beat, they went.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Besides that strait and stony was the way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, nigh directly, scaled a hill’s ascent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when arrived upon the summit, they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issued upon a mead of vast extent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a more pleasant palace on that green</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beheld, and brighter than was ever seen.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To meet the Child, Alcina, fair of hue,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-98" id="noteref-98" epub:type="noteref">98</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Advanced some way beyond the outer gate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, girded by a gay and courtly crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero there received in lordly state:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While all the rest to him such honour do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the knight with such deep reverence wait,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They could not have displayed more zeal and love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had Jove descended from the choirs above.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not so much does the palace, fair to see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In riches other princely domes excel,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that the gentlest, fairest, company</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which the whole world contains, within it dwell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of either sex, with small variety</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Between, in youth and beauty matched as well:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fay alone exceeds the rest as far</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As the bright sun outshines each lesser star.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Her shape is of such perfect symmetry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-99" id="noteref-99" epub:type="noteref">99</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As best to feign the industrious painter knows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With long and knotted tresses; to the eye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not yellow gold with brighter lustre glows.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon her tender cheek the mingled dye</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is scattered, of the lily and the rose.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like ivory smooth, the forehead gay and round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fills up the space, and forms a fitting bound.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Two black and slender arches rise above</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Two clear black eyes, say suns of radiant light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which ever softly beam and slowly move;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round these appears to sport in frolic flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence scattering all his shafts, the little Love,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And seems to plunder hearts in open sight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence, through mid visage, does the nose descend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Envy finds not blemish to amend.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As if between two vales, which softly curl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mouth with vermeil tint is seen to glow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within are strung two rows of orient pearl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which her delicious lips shut up or show.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of force to melt the heart of any churl,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">However rude, hence courteous accents flow:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And here that gentle smile receives its birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which opes at will a paradise on earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like milk the bosom, and the neck of snow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Round is the neck, and full and large the breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, fresh and firm, two ivory apples grow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which rise and fall, as, to the margin pressed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By pleasant breeze, the billows come and go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not prying Argus could discern the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet might the observing eye of things concealed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conjecture safely, from the charms revealed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To all her arms a just proportion bear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And a white hand is oftentimes descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which narrow is, and somedeal long; and where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No knot appears, nor vein is signified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For finish of that stately shape and rare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A foot, neat, short, and round, beneath is spied.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelic visions, creatures of the sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed beneath no covering veil can lie.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A springe is planted in Rogero’s way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On all sides did she speak, smile, sing, or move;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No wonder then the stripling was her prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who in the fairy saw such show of love.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With him the guilt and falsehood little weigh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of which the offended myrtle told above.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor will he think that perfidy and guile</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can be united with so sweet a smile.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No! he could now believe, by magic art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astolpho well transformed upon the plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For punishment of foul ungrateful heart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And haply meriting severer pain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, as for all he heard him late impart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas prompted by revenge, ’twas false and vain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By hate and malice was the sufferer stung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To blame and wound the fay with slanderous tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The beauteous lady whom he loved so well</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is newly banished from his altered breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For (such the magic of Alcina’s spell)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She every ancient passion dispossessed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in his bosom, there alone to dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The image of her love, and self impressed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So witched, Rogero sure some grace deserves,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If from his faith his frail affection swerves.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At board lyre, lute and harp of tuneful string,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other sounds, in mixed diversity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made, round about, the joyous palace ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With glorious concert and sweet harmony.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor lacked there well-accorded voice to sing</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of love, its passion and its ecstasy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor who, with rare inventions, choicely versed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Delightful fiction to the guests rehearsed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What table, spread by whatsoever heir</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Ninus, though triumphant were the board,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or what more famous and more costly, where<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-100" id="noteref-100" epub:type="noteref">100</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cleopatra feasted with the Latian lord,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could with this banquet’s matchless joys compare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the fond fairy for Rogero stored?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I think not such a feast is spread above,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where Ganymede presents the cup to Jove.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They form a ring, the board and festive cheer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-101" id="noteref-101" epub:type="noteref">101</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Removed, and sitting, play a merry game:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each asks, still whispering in a neighbour’s ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What secret pleases best; to knight and dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fair occasion, without let or fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their love, unheard of any, to proclaim.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in conclusion the two lovers plight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their word, to meet together on that night.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Soon, and much sooner than their wont, was ended</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The game at which the palace inmates play:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When pages on the troop with torches tended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with their radiance chased the night away.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek his bed the paladin ascended,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Girt with that goodly squadron, in a gay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And airy bower, appointed for his rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid all the others chosen as the best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when of comfits and of cordial wine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-102" id="noteref-102" epub:type="noteref">102</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A fitting proffer has been made anew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The guests their bodies reverently incline,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to their bowers depart the courtly crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He upon perfumed sheets, whose texture fine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seemed of Arachne’s loom, his body threw:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearkening this while with still attentive ears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he the coming of the lady hears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At every movement heard on distant floor,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping ’twas her, Rogero raised his head:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He thinks he hears; but it is heard no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then sighs at his mistake: ofttimes from bed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He issued, and undid his chamber door,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And peeped abroad, but still no better sped;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cursed a thousand times the hour that she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So long retarded his felicity.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yes, now she comes,” the stripling often said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And reckoned up the paces, as he lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from her bower where haply to be made</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To that where he was waiting for the fay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These thoughts, and other thoughts as vain, he weighed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before she came, and restless at her stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often believed some hinderance, yet unscanned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might interpose between the fruit and hand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At length, when dropping sweets the costly fay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had put some end to her perfumery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The time now come she need no more delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since all was hushed within the palace, she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stole from her bower alone, through secret way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And passed towards the chamber silently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where on his couch the youthful cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay, with a heart long torn by Hope and Fear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When the successor of Astolpho spies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Those smiling stars above him, at the sight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A flame, like that of kindled sulphur, flies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through his full veins, as ravished by delight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Out of himself; and now up to the eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Plunged in a sea of bliss, he swims outright.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He leaps from bed and folds her to his breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor waits until the lady he undressed;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Though but in a light sendal clad,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-103" id="noteref-103" epub:type="noteref">103</a> that she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wore in the place of farthingale or gown;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which o’er a shift of finest quality,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And white, about her limbs the fay had thrown:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mantle yielded at his touch, as he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embraced her, and that veil remained alone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which upon every side the damsel shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than clear glass the lily or the rose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The plant no closer does the ivy clip,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With whose green boughs its stem is interlaced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than those fond lovers, each from either’s lip</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The balmy breath collecting, he embraced:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rich perfume this, whose like no seed or slip</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bears in sweet Indian or Sabacan waste;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While so to speak their joys is either fixed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That oftentimes those meeting lips are mixed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>These things were carried closely by the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And youth, or if surmised, were never bruited;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For silence seldom was a cause for blame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But oftener as a virtue well reputed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By those shrewd courtiers, conscious of his claim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero is with proffers fair saluted:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worshipped of all those inmates, who fulfil</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In this the enamoured far, Alcina’s will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No pleasure is omitted there; since they</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alike are prisoners in Love’s magic hall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They change their raiment twice or thrice a day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now for this use, and now at other call.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis often feast, and always holiday;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis wrestling, tourney, pageant, bath, and ball.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now underneath a hill by fountain cast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They read the amorous lays of ages past:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Now by glad hill, or through the shady dale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They hunt the fearful hare, and now they flush</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With busy dog, sagacious of the trail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wild pheasant from the stubble-field or bush.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now where green junipers perfume the gale,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspend the snare, or lime the fluttering thrush:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-104" id="noteref-104" epub:type="noteref">104</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And casting now for fish, with net or book,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero revels there, in like delight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While Charles and Agramant are troubled sore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But not for him their story will I slight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor Bradamant forget: who evermore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid toilsome pain and care, her cherished knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ravished from her, did many a day deplore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom by unwonted ways, transported through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid air, the damsel saw, nor whither knew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of her I speak before the royal pair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who many days pursued her search in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By shadowy wood, or over champaign bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By farm and city, and by hill and plain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But seeks her cherished friend with fruitless care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Divided by such space of land and main:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Often she goes among the Paynim spears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet never aught of her Rogero hears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Of hundreds questioned, upon every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each day, no answer ever gives content.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She roams from post to post, and far and wide</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Searches pavilion, lodging, booth, or rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And this, mid foot or horsemen, unespied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May safely do, without impediment,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thanks to the ring, whose more than mortal aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When in her mouth, conceals the vanished maid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She cannot, will not, think that he is dead;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because the wreck of such a noble knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would, from Hydaspes’ distant waves have spread,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To where the sun descends with westering light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She knows not what to think, nor whither sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He roams in earth or air; yet, hapless wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him ever seeks, and for attendant train</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has sobs and sighs, and every bitter pain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At length to find the wondrous cave she thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the prophetic homes of Merlin lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And there lament herself until she wrought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the pitying marble to reply;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For thence, if yet he lived would she be taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of this glad life to hard necessity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had yielded up; and, when she was possessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the seer’s councils, would pursue the best.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>With this intention, Bradamant her way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Directed thither, where in Poictier’s wood</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The vocal tomb, containing Merlin’s clay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Concealed in Alpine place and savage, stood.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that enchantress sage, who night and day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thought of the damsel, watchful for her good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She, I repeat, who taught her what should be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that fair grotto her posterity;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She who preserved her with protecting care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That same enchantress, still benign and wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, knowing she a matchless race should bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of men, or rather semi-deities,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spies daily what her thoughts and actions are,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lots for her each day, divining, tries;⁠—<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-105" id="noteref-105" epub:type="noteref">105</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She all Rogero’s fortune knew, how freed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then borne to India by the griffin steed:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him on that courser plainly she had eyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would not the controlling rein obey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, severed by such interval, he hied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne through the perilous, unwonted way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And knew that he sport, dance, and banquet plied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus such gentle knight ingloriously</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have consumed his fairest years and best,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In long inaction, afterwards to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Body and soul, destroyed; and <em>that</em>, possessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone by us in perpetuity.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That flower, whose sweets outlive the fragile rest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which quickens man when he in earth is laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have been plucked or severed in the blade.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But that enchantress kind, who with more care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than for himself he watched, still kept the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Designed to drag him, by rough road and bare,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards true virtue, in his own despite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As often cunning leech will burn and pare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flesh, and poisonous drug employ aright:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, though at first his cruel art offend,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is thanked, since he preserves us in the end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, not like old Atlantes, rendered blind</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the great love she to the stripling bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Set not on gifting him with life her mind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As was the scope of that enchanter hoar;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, reckless all of fame and praise declined,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wished length of days to his Rogero more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than that, to win a world’s applause, the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should of his joyous life forego one year.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By him he to Alcina’s isle had been</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dispatched, that in her palace he might dwell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forgetting arms; and, as enchanter seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In magic and the use of every spell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heart had fastened of that fairy-queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enamoured of the gentle youth, so well,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That she the knot would never disengage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though he should live to more than Nestor’s age.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Returning now to her that well foreknew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whatever was to come to pass, I say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She thither did her journey straight pursue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where she met Aymon’s daughter by the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forlorn and wandering: Bradamant at view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her enchantress, erst to grief a prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changes it all to hope: the other tells</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That with Alcina her Rogero dwells.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nigh dead the maid remains, in piteous guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hearing of him so far removed, and more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Grieves that she danger to her love descries,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save this some strong and speedy cure restore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But her the enchantress comforts, and applies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A salve where it was needed most, and swore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That few short days should pass before anew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero should return to glad her view.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Since thou, an antidote to sorcery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lady (she said), the virtuous ring dost wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have no doubt if to yon island I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This, where thine every good is hidden, hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To foil Alcina’s wiles and witchery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence to bring thee back thy cherished care.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This evening, early, will I hence away,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And be in India by the break of day.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And told to her, the tale continuing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The mode which she was purposing to employ,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From that effeminate, soft realm to bring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Back into warlike France the cherished boy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bradamant from her finger slipt the ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this alone would have bestowed with joy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But heart and life would at her feet have laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she had deemed they could Rogero aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Giving the ring, her cause she recommends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To her, and recommends Rogero more.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Countless salutes by her the damsel sends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then of Provence, departing seeks the shore.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The enchantress to another quarter wends;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, for the execution of her lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conjures, that eve, a palfrey, by her art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With one foot red, black every other part.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Some Farfarello, or Alchino he,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-106" id="noteref-106" epub:type="noteref">106</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I think, whom in that form she raised from hell;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with loose hair, dishevelled horribly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ungirt and barefoot, mounted in the sell.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, with wise caution, from her finger she</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Withdrew the ring, lest it should mar the spell:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And then by him was with such swiftness born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She in Alcina’s isle arrived at morn.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Herself she changed with wonderful disguise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Adding a palm of stature to her height;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made her limbs of a proportioned size;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of the very measure seemed to sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As was she deemed, the necromancer wise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with such care had reared the youthful knight.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With long-descending beard she clothed her chin,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wrinkled o’er her front and other skin.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To imitate his speech, and face, and cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She knew so well, that, by the youth descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She might the sage Atlantes’ self appear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next hid, and watched so long, that she espied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon a day (rare chance) the cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At length detached from his Alcina’s side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For still, in motion or at rest, the fay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill bore the youth should be an hour away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Alone she finds him, fitting well her will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As he enjoys the pure and morning air</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside a brook, which trickled from a hill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Streaming towards a limpid lake and fair.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fine, soft garments, wove with cunning skill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All over, ease and wantonness declare;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These with her hand, such subtle toil well taught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him in silk and gold Alcina wrought.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>About the stripling’s neck, a splendid string</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of gems, descending to mid-breast, is wound;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On each once manly arm, now glittering</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the bright hoop, a bracelet fair is bound.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-107" id="noteref-107" epub:type="noteref">107</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pierced with golden wire, in form of ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is either ear; and from the yellow round</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Depend two precious pearls; not such the coast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Araby or sumptuous India boast.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Crisped into comely ringlets was his hair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wet with the costliest odours and the best;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And soft and amorous all his gestures were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like one who does Valentian lady’s hest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-108" id="noteref-108" epub:type="noteref">108</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In him, beside his name, was nothing fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And more than half corrupted all the rest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was Rogero found, within that dell,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changed from his former self by potent spell.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Him in the figure of Atlantes sage</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She fronts, who bore the enchanter’s borrowed cheer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With that grave face, and reverend with age,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he was always wonted to revere;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And with that eye, which in his pupillage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beaming with wrath, he whilom so did fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sternly cries, “Is this the fruit at last</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which pays my tedious pain and labour past?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The marrow of the lion and the bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Didst thou for this thine early banquet make,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, trained by me, by cliff or cavern-lair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Strangle with infant hands the crested snake;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their claws from tiger and from panther tear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tusks from living boar in tangled brake,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That, bred in such a school, in thee should I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alcina’s Atys or Adonis spy?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Is this the hope that stars, observed by me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Signs in conjunction, sacred fibres, bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With what beside of dream or augury,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And all those lots I but too deeply read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, while yet hanging at the breast, of thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When these thy years should be accomplished, said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thy fears should so be bruited far and near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou justly should be deemed without a peer?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“This does, in truth, a fair beginning show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A seed which, we may hope, will soon conceive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A Julius, Alexander, Scipio.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who thee Alcina’s bondsman could believe;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (for the world the shameful fact might know)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That all should, manifest to sight, perceive</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon thy neck and arms the servile chains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith she at her will her captive trains?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If thine own single honour move not thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the high deeds which thou art called to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherefore defraud thy fair posterity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of what, was oft predicted, should ensue?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alas! why seal the womb God willed should be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Pregnant by thee with an illustrious crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That far renowned, and more than human line,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destined the sun in glory to outshine?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Forbid not of the noblest souls the birth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Formed in the ideas of <b>eternal mind</b>,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Destined, from age to age, to visit earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sprung from thy stock, and clothed in corporal rind;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The spring of thousand palms and festal mirth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through which, to Italy with losses pined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wounds, thy good descendants shall restore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fame and honours she enjoyed of yore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not only should these many souls have weight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To bend thy purpose, holy souls, and bright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from thy fruitful tree shall vegetate;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, though alone, a single couple might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suffice a nobler feeling to create,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alphonso and his brother Hyppolite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose like was seldom witnessed to this time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through all the paths whence men to virtue climb.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I was more wont to dwell upon this pair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than all the rest, of whom I prophesied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well that these a greater part should bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In lofty virtues, as that I descried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee, listening to my lore with closer care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to the tale of all thy seed beside.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I saw thee joy that such a pair would shine</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid the heroes of thy noble line.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Say, what has she, thou makest thy fancy’s queen,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More than what other courtezans possess?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of so many concubine has been;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How used her lovers in the end to bless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou truly know’st: but that she may be seen</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without disguise, and in her real dress,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This ring, returning, on thy finger wear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou shalt see the dame, and mark how fair.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Abashed and mute, Rogero, listening,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In vain to her reproof an answer sought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on his little finger put the ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose virtue to himself the warrior brought.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And such remorse and shame within him spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When on his altered sense the change is wrought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand fathoms deep he fain would lie</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Buried in earth, unseen of any eye.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So speaking, to the natural shape she wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before his eyes returned the magic dame;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor old Atlantes’ form was needed more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The good effect obtained for which she came.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To tell you that which was not told before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Melissa was the sage enchantress’ name:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to Rogero now her purpose said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told with what design she thither sped:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Dispatched by her, who him in anxious pain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Desires, nor longer can without him be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With the intent to loose him from the chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wherewith he was begirt by sorcery;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And had put on, more credence to obtain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Atlantes de Carena’s form; but she,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Seeing his health restored, now willed the youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through her should hear and see the very truth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That gentle lady who so loves thee, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were well deserving love upon thy part:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom (unless forgot, thou know’st how true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tale) thou debtor for thy freedom art,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This ring, which can each magic spell undo,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sends for thy succour, and would send her heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If with such virtue fraught, her heart could bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thee safely in thy perils, like the ring.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>How Bradamant had loved, and loves, she says,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Continuing to Rogero her relation:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To this, her worth commends with fitting praise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tempering in truth and fondness her narration;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still employs the choicest mode and phrase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which fits one skilful in negociation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the false Alcina brings such hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As on things horrible is wont to wait;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Brings hate on that which he so loved before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor let the tale astonish which you hear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For since his love was forced by magic lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ring the false enchantment served to clear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This too unmasked the charms Alcina wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And made all false, from head to food, appear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">None of her own, but borrowed, all he sees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the once sparkling cup now drugged with lees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Like boy who somewhere his ripe fruit bestows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next forgets the place where it is laid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then, after many days, conducted goes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By chance, where he the rich deposit made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wonders that the hidden treasure shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not what it is, but rotten and decayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And hates, and scorns, and loathes, with altered eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And throws away what he was used to prize.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero thus, when by Melissa’s lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Advised, he to behold the fay returned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that good ring of sovereign virtue wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, on the finger placed, all spells o’erturned;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For that fair damsel he had left before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his surprise, so foul a dame discerned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in this ample world, examined round,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A hag so old and hideous is not found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Pale, lean, and wrinkled was the face, and white,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thinly clothed with hair Alcina’s head;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her stature reached not to six palms in height,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And every tooth was gone; for she had led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A longer life than ever mortal wight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than Hecuba or she in Cuma bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But thus by practice, to our age unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By art she gave herself the lovely look,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which had on many like Rogero wrought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But now the ring interpreted the book,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which secrets, hid for many ages, taught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No wonder then that he the dame forsook,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And banished from his mind all further thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of love for false Alcina, found in guise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But, as Melissa counselled him, he wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His wonted semblance for a time, till he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was with his armour, many days before</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Laid by, again accoutred cap-a-pee.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, lest Alcina should his end explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigned to make proof of his agility;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Feigned to make proof if for his arms he were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Too gross, long time unwont the mail to bear.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Next Balisarda to his flank he tied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For so Rogero’s trenchant sword was hight),</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And took the wondrous buckler, which, espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not only dazzled the beholder’s sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But seemed, when its silk veil was drawn aside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As from the body if exhaled the sprite:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In its close cover of red sendal hung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This at his neck the youthful warrior slung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Provided thus, he to the stables came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And bade with bridle and with saddle dight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A horse more black than pitch; for so the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Counselled, well-taught how swift the steed and light.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him Rabicano those who know him name,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he the courser was, that with the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who stands beside the sea, the breeze’s sport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The whale of yore conducted to that port.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The hippogryph he might have had at need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who next below good Rabican was tied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that the dame had cried to him, “Take heed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou know’st how ill that courser is to ride;”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And said the following day the winged steed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twas her intention from that realm to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he should be instructed at his leisure,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rein and run him every where at pleasure:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor, if he took him not, would he suggest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Suspicion of the intended flight: The peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This while performed Melissa’s every hest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, still invisible, was at his ear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So feigning, from the wanton dome possessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that old strumpet, rode the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And pricking forth drew near unto a gate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence the road led to Logistilla’s state.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Assaulting suddenly the guardian crew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, sword in hand, the squadron set upon;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This one he wounded, and that other slew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, point by point made good, the drawbridge won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ere of his escape Alcina knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The gentle youth was far away and gone.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My next shall tell his route, and how he gained</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At last the realm where Logistilla reigned.</span>

				<span>How many enchantresses among us! oh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How many enchanters are there, though unknown!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who for their love make man or woman glow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Changing them into figures not their own.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor this by help of spirits from below,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor observation of the stars is done:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-109" id="noteref-109" epub:type="noteref">109</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But these on hearts with fraud and falsehood plot,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Binding them with indissoluble knot.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who with Angelica’s, or rather who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were fortified with Reason’s ring, would see</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each countenance, exposed to open view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unchanged by art or by hypocrisy.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This now seems fair and good, whose borrowed hue</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Removed, would haply foul and evil be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well was it for Rogero that he wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The virtuous ring which served the truth to explore!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rogero, still dissembling, as I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Armed, to the gate on Rabican did ride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Found the guard unprepared, not let his blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Amid that crowd, hang idle at his side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He passed the bridge, and broke the palisade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some slain, some maimed; then t’wards the forest hied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But on that road small space had measured yet,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When he a servant of the fairy met.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He on his fist a ravening falcon bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which he made fly for pastime every day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now on the champaign, now upon the shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of neighbouring pool, which teemed with certain prey;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And rode a hack which simple housings wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His faithful dog, companion of his way.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-110" id="noteref-110" epub:type="noteref">110</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, marking well the haste with which he hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conjectures truly what Rogero flies.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Towards him came the knave, with semblance haught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Demanding whither in such haste he sped:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the good Rogero answers naught.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He hence assured more clearly that he fled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Within himself to stop the warrior thought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus, with his left arm extended, said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“What, if I suddenly thy purpose balk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thou find no defence against this hawk?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Then flies his bird, who works so well his wing,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rabican cannot distance him in flight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The falconer from his back to ground did spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And freed him from the bit which held him tight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who seemed an arrow parted from the string,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And terrible to foe, with kick and bite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">While with such haste behind the servant came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He sped as moved by wind, or rather flame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor will the falconer’s dog appear more slow;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But hunts Rogero’s courser, as in chase</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of timid hare the pard is wont to go.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to stand fast the warrior deems disgrace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And turns towards the swiftly-footed foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he sees wield a riding-wand, place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of other arms, to make his dog obey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero scorns his faulchion to display.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The servant made at him, and smote him sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The dog his left foot worried; while untied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From rein, the lightened horse three times and more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lashed from the croup, nor missed his better side.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hawk, oft wheeling, with her talons tore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The stripling, and his horse so terrified,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser, by the whizzing sound dismayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Little the guiding hand or spur obeyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Constrained at length, his sword Rogero drew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To clear the rabble, who his course delay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the animals’ or villain’s view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Did now its point, and now its edge display.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with more hinderance and vexatious crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Swarm here and there, and wholly block the way;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that dishonour will ensue and loss,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero sees, if him they longer cross.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He knew each little that he longer stayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would bring the fay and followers on the trail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already drums were beat, and trumpets brayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And larum-bells rang loud in every vale.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">An act too foul it seemed to use his blade</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On dog, and knave unfenced with arms or mail:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A better and shorter way it were</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The buckler, old Atlantes’ work, to bare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He raised the crimson cloth in which he wore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wondrous shield, enclosed for many a day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Its beams, as proved a thousand times before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Work as they wont, when on the sight they play;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Senseless the falconer tumbles on the moor;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drop dog and hackney; drop the pinions gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which poised in air the bird no longer keep:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then glad Rogero leaves a prey to sleep.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In the mean time, Alcina, who had heard</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How he had forced the gate, and, in the press,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Slaughtered a mighty number of her guard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Remained nigh dead, o’erwhelmed with her distress:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She tore her vesture, and her visage marred,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And cursed her want of wit and wariness.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then made forthwith her meiny sound to arms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And round herself arrayed her martial swarms.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Divided next, one squadron by the way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero took, she sent; the bands were two:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She at the port embarked the next array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And straight to sea dispatched the warlike crew.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With this good squadron went the desperate fay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And darked by loosened sails the billows grew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so desire upon her bosom preyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of troops she left her city unpurveyed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Without a guard she left her palace there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to Melissa, prompt her time to seize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To loose her vassals that in misery were,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Afforded all convenience and full ease;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—To range, at leisure, through the palace fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so examine all her witcheries;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To raze the seal, burn images, and loose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or cancel hag-knot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-111" id="noteref-111" epub:type="noteref">111</a> rhomb, or magic noose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thence, through the fields, fast hurrying from that dome,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The former lovers changed, a mighty train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some into rock or tree, to fountain some,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or beast, she made assume their shapes again:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And these, when they anew are free to roam,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Follow Rogero’s footsteps to the reign</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Logistilla’s sage; and from that bourn</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Scythia, Persia, Greece, and Ind return.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They to their several homes dispatched, repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bound by a debt which never can be paid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The English duke, above the rest her care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of these, was first in human form arrayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For much his kindred and the courteous prayer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of good Rogero with Melissa weighed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside his prayers, the ring Rogero gave;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That him she by its aid might better save.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thus by Rogero’s suit the enchantress won,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To his first shape transformed the youthful peer;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But good Melissa deemed that nought was done</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save she restored his armour, and that spear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of gold, which whensoe’er at tilt he run,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At the first touch unseated cavalier;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-112" id="noteref-112" epub:type="noteref">112</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Once Argalìa’s, next Astolpho’s lance,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And source of mighty fame to both in France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sage Melissa found this spear of gold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which now Alcina’s magic palace graced,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And other armour of the warrior bold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of which he was in that ill dome uncased.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She climbed the courser of the wizard old,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And on the croup, at ease, Astolpho placed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thus, an hour before Rogero came,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Repaired to Logistilla, knight and dame.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meantime, through rugged rocks, and shagged with thorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero wends, to seek the sober fay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From cliff to cliff, from path to path forlorn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A rugged, lone, inhospitable way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till he, with labour huge oppressed and worn,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Issued at noon upon a beach, that lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twixt sea and mountain, open to the south,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserted, barren, bare, and parched with drouth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The sunbeams on the neighbouring mountain beat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-113" id="noteref-113" epub:type="noteref">113</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And glare, reflected from the glowing mass</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So fiercely, sand and air both boil with heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In mode that might have more than melted glass.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The birds are silent in their dim retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any note is heard in wood or grass,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save the bough perched Cicala’s wearying cry,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which deafens hill and dale, and sea and sky.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The heat and thirst and labour which he bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By that drear sandy way beside the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Along the unhabited and sunny shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were to Rogero grievous company:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bur for I may not still pursue this lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor should you busied with one matter be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rogero I abandon in this heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For Scotland; to pursue Rinaldo’s beat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By king, by daughter, and by all degrees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Sir Rinaldo was large welcome paid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And next the warrior, at his better ease,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The occasion of his embassy displayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“That he from thence and England, subsidies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of men was seeking, for his monarch’s aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Charles’s name;” and added, in his care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The justest reasons to support his prayer.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The king made answer, that “without delay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taxed to the utmost of his powers and might,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His means at Charlemagne’s disposal lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the honour of the empire and the right.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And that, within few days, he in array</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such horsemen, as he had in arms, would dight;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, save that he was now waxed old, would lead</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The expedition he was prayed to speed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Nor like consideration would appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Worthy to stop him, but that he possessed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A son, and for such charge that cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Measured by wit and force, was worthiest.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though not within the kingdom was the peer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It was his hope (as he assured his guest)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He would, while yet preparing was the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Return, and find it mustered to his hand.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So sent through all his realm, with expedition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His treasures, to levy men and steeds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ships prepared, and warlike ammunition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And money, stores and victual for their needs.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meantime the good Rinaldo on his mission,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Leaving the courteous king, to England speeds;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He brought him on his way to Berwick’s town,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And was observed to weep when he was gone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The wind sat in the poop; Rinaldo good</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embarked and bade farewell to all; the sheet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still loosening to the breeze, the skipper stood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till where Thames’ waters, waxing bitter, meet</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Salt ocean: wafted thence by tide of flood,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through a sure channel to fair London’s seat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Safely the mariners their course explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Making their way, with aid of sail and oar.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The Emperor Charles, and he, King Otho grave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who was with Charles, by siege in Paris pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A broad commission to Rinaldo brave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With letters to the Prince of Wales addressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And countersigns had given, dispatched to crave</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What foot and horse were by the land possessed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The whole to be to Calais’ port conveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it to France and Charles might furnish aid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The prince I speak of, who on Otho’s throne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sate in his stead, the vacant helm to guide,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such honor did to Aymon’s valiant son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-114" id="noteref-114" epub:type="noteref">114</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He not with such his king had gratified.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Next, all to good Rinaldo’s wish, was done:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since for his martial bands on every side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Britain, or the isles which round her lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To assemble near the sea he fixed a day.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But here, sir, it behoves me shift my ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like him that makes the sprightly viol ring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who often changes chord and varies sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now a graver strikes, now sharper string:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus I:⁠—who did to good Rinaldo bound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My tale, Angelica remembering;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Late left, where saved from him by hasty flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She had encountered with an anchorite.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Awhile I will pursue her story: I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Told how the maid of him with earnest care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Enquired, how she towards the shore might fly:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who of the loathed Rinaldo has such fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She dreads, unless she pass the sea, to die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As insecure in Europe, far or near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But she was by the hermit kept in play,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because he pleasure took with her to stay.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>His heart with love of that rare beauty glowed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to his frozen marrow pierced the heat;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, after, when he saw that she bestowed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Small care on him, and thought but of retreat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His sluggish courser stung with many a goad;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with no better speed he plied his feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ill was his walk, and worse his trot: nor spur</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could that dull beast to quicker motion stir:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And for the flying maid was far before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he would soon have ceased to track her steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the dark cave recurred the hermit hoar,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And conjured up of fiends a grisly breed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One he selected out of many more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And first informed the demon of his need;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then in the palfrey bade him play his part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with the lady bore away his heart:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And as sagacious dog on mountain tried</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before, accustomed fox and hare to chase,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he behold the quarry choose one side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The other takes, and seems to slight the trace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But at the turn arriving, is espied,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already tearing what he crossed to face;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So her the hermit by a different road</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will meet, wherever she her palfrey goad.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>What was the friar’s design I well surmise;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you shall know; but in another page.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica now slow, now faster, flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nought fearing this: while conjured by the sage,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The demon covered in the courser lies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As fire sometimes will hide its smothered rage:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then blazes with devouring flame and heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unquenchable, and scarce allows retreat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>After the flying maid had shaped her course</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the great sea which laves the Gascon shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Still keeping to the rippling waves her horse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where best the moistened sand the palfrey bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, plunged into the brine, the fiend perforce</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dragged, till he swam amid the watery roar.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor what to do the timid damsel knew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save that she closer to her saddle grew.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She cannot, howsoe’er the rein she ply,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Govern the horse, who swims the surge to meet:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her raiment she collects and holds it high;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, not to wet them, gathers up her feet.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her tresses, which the breeze still wantonly</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Assaults, dishevelled on her shoulders beat.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The louder winds are hushed, perchance in duty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent, like ocean, on such sovereign beauty.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Landward in vain her eyes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-115" id="noteref-115" epub:type="noteref">115</a> the damsel bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Directs, which water face and breast with tears,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And ever sees, decreasing to her sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beach she left, which less and less appears.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The courser, who was swimming to the right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">After a mighty sweep, the lady bears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To shore, where rock and cavern shag the brink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As night upon the land begins to sink.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When in that desert, which but to descry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bred fear in the beholder, stood the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone, as Phoebus, plunged in ocean, sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And nether earth had left obscured in shade;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She paused in guise, which in uncertainty</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Might leave whoever had the form surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she were real woman, or some mock</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Resemblance, coloured in the living rock.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She, fixed and stupid in her wretchedness,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stood on the shifting sand, with ruffled hair:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her hands were joined, her lips were motionless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her languid eyes upturned, as in despair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Accusing Him on high, that to distress</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And whelm her, all the fates united were.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Astound she stood awhile; when grief found vent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through eyes and tongue, in tears and in lament:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Fortune what more remains, that thou on me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shouldst not now satiate thy revengeful thirst?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What more (she said) can I bestow on thee</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than, what thou seekest not, this life accurst?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thou wast in haste to snatch me from the sea,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where I had ended its sad days, immersed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Because to torture me with further ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Before I die, is yet thy cruel will.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“But what worse torment yet remains in store</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beyond, I am unable to descry:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By thee from my fair throne, which nevermore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I hope to repossess, compelled to fly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I, what is worse, my honour lost deplore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For if I sinned not in effect, yet I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Give matter by my wanderings to be stung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For wantonness of every carping tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What other good is left to woman, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Has lost her honour, in this earthly ball?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What profits it that, whether false or true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I am deemed beauteous, and am young withal?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No thanks to heaven for such a gift are due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whence on my head does every mischief fall.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this my brother Argalìa died;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom small help enchanted arms supplied:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“For this the Tartar king, Sir Agrican,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Subdued my sire, who Galaphron was hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of Catày in India was great khan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Tis hence I am reduced to such a plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That wandering evermore, I cannot scan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At morn, where I shall lay my head at night.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If thou hast ravished what thou couldst, wealth, friends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And honour; say what more thy wrath intends.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If death by drowning in the foaming sea</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was not enough thy wrath to satiate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Send, if thou wilt, some beast to swallow me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he keep me not in pain! Thy hate</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot devise a torment, so it be</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My death, but I shall thank thee for my fate!”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus, with loud sobs, the weeping lady cried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she beheld the hermit at her side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From the extremest height the hermit hoar</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that high rock above her, had surveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Angelica, arrived upon the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beneath the cliff, afflicted and dismayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He to that place had come six days before;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For him by path untrod had fiend conveyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he approached her, feigning such a call,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As e’er Hilarion might have had, or Paul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>When him, yet unagnized, she saw appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The lady took some comfort, and laid by,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Emboldened by degrees, her former fear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though still her visage was of deathlike dye.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Misericord!</i> father,” when the friar was near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(She said), “for brought to evil pass am I.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And told, still broke by sobs, in doleful tone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The story, to her hearer not unknown.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To comfort her, some reasons full of grace,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sage and devout the approaching hermit cites:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, now his hand upon her moistened face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In speaking, now upon her bosom lights:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As her, securer, next he would embrace:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him, kindling into pretty scorn, she smites</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With one hand on his breast, and backward throws,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then flushed with honest red, all over glows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>A pocket at the ancient’s side was dight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he a cruise of virtuous liquor wore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And at those puissant eyes, whence flashed the light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the most radiant torch Love ever bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Threw from the flask a little drop, of might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To make her sleep: upon the sandy shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Already the recumbent damsel lay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The greedy elder’s unresisting prey.</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hopeless, at length upon the beach he lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And by the maid, exhausted, falls asleep.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When to torment him new misfortunes rise:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Fortune does seldom any measure keep;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Unused to cut her cruel pastime short,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If she with mortal man is pleased to sport.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>It here behoves me, from the path I pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To turn awhile, ere I this case relate:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In the great northern sea, towards the west,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Green Ireland past, an isle is situate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ebuda is its name,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-118" id="noteref-118" epub:type="noteref">118</a> whose shores infest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Its people wasted through the Godhead’s hate)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The hideous orc, and Proteus’ other herd,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him against that race in vengeance stirred.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Old stories, speak they falsely or aright,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Tell how a puissant king this country swayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who had a daughter fair, so passing bright</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And lovely, ’twas no wonder if the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When on the beach she stood in Proteus’ sight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left him to burn amid the waves: surveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One day alone, upon that shore in-isled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her he compressed, and quitted great with child.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This was sore torment to the sire, severe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And impious more than all mankind; nor he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such is the force of wrath, was moved to spare</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The maid, for reason or for piety.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, though he saw her pregnant, would forbear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To execute his sentence suddenly;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But bade together with the mother kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ere born, his grandchild, who had done no ill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sea-Proteus to his flocks’ wide charge preferred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By Neptune, of all ocean’s rule possessed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Inflamed with ire, his lady’s torment heard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, against law and usage, to molest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The land (no sluggard in his anger) stirred</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His monsters, orc and sea-calf, with the rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who waste not only herds, but human haunts,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Farm-house and town, with their inhabitants:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And girding them on every side, the rout</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will often siege to walled cities lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where in long weariness and fearful doubt,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The townsmen keep their watch by night and day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fields they have abandoned all about,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And for a remedy, their last assay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To the oracle, demanding counsel, fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which to the suppliant’s prayer made this reply:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“That it behoved them find a damsel, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A form as beauteous as that other wore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be to Proteus offered up, in lieu</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the fair lady, slain upon the shore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, if he deems her an atonement due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will keep the damsel, not disturb them more:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If not; another they must still present,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And so, till they the deity content.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And this it was the cruel usage bred;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That of the damsels held most fair of face,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To Proteus every day should one be led.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till one should in the Godhead’s sight find grace.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The first and all those others slain, who fed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">All a devouring orc, that kept his place</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Beside the port, what time into the main</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The remnant of the herd retired again.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Were the old tale of Proteus’ false or true,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(For this, in sooth, I know not who can read)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With such a clause was kept by that foul crew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The savage, ancient statute, which decreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That woman’s flesh the ravening monster, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For this came every day to land, should feed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Though to be woman is a crying ill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In every place, ’tis here a greater still.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O wretched maids! whom ’mid that barbarous rout</span>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Crowd with their captives dungeon-cell and tower.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Keeping that region close aboard, to explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The island’s lonely bank, a gallery creeps;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, amid stubs upon the grassy shore,</span>

				<span class="i1">Oh! cruel Fortune! who believed thy sway</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was of such passing power in things below?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That thou shouldst make a hideous monster’s prey</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The beauty, for which Agrican did glow,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Oppressed with heavy sleep upon the shore,</span>

				<span class="i1">This done, they hoisted up their sail once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the bark made the fatal isle again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, till the lot shall of their prey dispose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her prisoned in a castle they enclose.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But such her matchless beauty’s power, the maid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was able that fierce crew to mollify,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who many days her cruel death delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Preserved until their last necessity;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And while they damsels from without purveyed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Spared such angelic beauty: finally,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel to the monstrous orc they bring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people all behind her sorrowing.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who shall relate the anguish, the lament</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And outcry which against the welkin knock?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I marvel that the sea-shore was not rent,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When she was placed upon the rugged block,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where, chained and void of help, the punishment</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of loathsome death awaits her on the rock.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This will not I, so sorrow moves me, say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which makes me turn my rhymes another way;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To find a verse of less lugubrious strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till I my wearied spirit shall restore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For not the squalid snake of mottled stain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor wild and whelpless tiger, angered more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor what of venomous, on burning plain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Creeps ’twixt the Red and the Atlantic shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could see the grisly sight, and choose but moan</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel bound upon the naked stone.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Oh! if this chance to her Orlando, who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was gone to Paris-town to seek the maid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had been reported! or those other two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Duped by a post, dispatched from Stygian shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They would have tracked her heavenly footsteps through</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A thousand deaths, to bear the damsel aid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But had the warriors of her peril known,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So far removed, for what would that have done?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This while round Paris-walls the leaguer lay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of famed Troyano’s son’s besieging band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Reduced to such extremity one day,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it nigh fell into the foeman’s hand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, but that vows had virtue to allay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wrath of Heaven, whose waters drenched the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That day had perished by the Moorish lance</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The holy empire and great name of France.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To the just plaint of aged Charlemagne</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The great Creator turned his eyes, and stayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The conflagration with a sudden rain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which haply human art had not allayed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wise whosoever seeketh, not in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His help, than whose there is no better aid!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well the religious king, to whom ’twas given,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Knew that the saving succour was from Heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All night long counsel of his weary bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Vexed with a ceaseless care, Orlando sought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now here, now there, the restless fancy sped,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now turned, now seized, but never held the thought:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As when, from sun or nightly planet shed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Clear water has the quivering radiance caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The flashes through the spacious mansion fly,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With reaching leap, right, left, and low, and high.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-120" id="noteref-120" epub:type="noteref">120</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To memory now returned his lady gay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She rather ne’er was banished from his breast;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And fanned the secret fire, which through the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Now kindled into flame) had seemed at rest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That in his escort even from Catày</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or farthest Ind, had journeyed to the west;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">There lost: Of whom he had discerned no token</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since Charles’s power near Bordeaux-town was broken.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>This in Orlando moved great grief, and he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lay thinking on his folly past in vain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“My heart,” he said, “oh! how unworthily</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I bore myself! and out, alas! what pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(When night and day I might have dwelt with thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since this thou didst not in thy grace disdain,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have let them place thee in old Namus’ hand!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Witless a wrong so crying to withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Might I not have excused myself?⁠—The king</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had not perchance gainsaid my better right⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of if he had gainsaid my reasoning,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who would have taken thee in my despite?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Why not have armed, and rather let them wring</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My heart out of my breast? But not the might</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Charles or all his host, had they been tried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Could have availed to tear thee from my side.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Oh! had he placed her but in strong repair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Guarded in some good fort, or Paris-town!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Since he <em>would</em> trust her to Duke Namus’ care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That he should lose her in this way, alone</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sorts with my wish.⁠—Who would have kept the fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like me, that would for her to death have gone?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have kept her better than my heart or sight:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who should and could, yet did not what I might.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Without me, my sweet life, beshrew me, where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Art thou bestowed, so beautiful and young!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As some lost lamb, what time the daylight fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shuts in, remains the wildering woods among,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And goes about lamenting here and there,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoping to warn the shepherd with her tongue;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till the wolf hear from far the mournful strain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And the sad shepherd weep for her in vain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My hope, where are thou, where? In doleful wise</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Dost thou, perchance, yet rove thy lonely round?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Art thou, indeed, to ravening wolf a prize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Without thy faithful Roland’s succour found?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And is the flower, which, with the deities,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me, in mid heaven had placed, which, not to wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So reverent was my love) thy feelings chaste,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I kept untouched, alas! now plucked and waste?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If this fair flower be plucked, oh, misery! oh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Despair! what more is left me but to die?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Almighty God, with every other woe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rather than this, thy wretched suppliant try.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If this be true, these hands the fatal blow</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall deal, and doom me to eternity.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mixing his plaint with bitter tears and sighs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So to himself the grieved Orlando cries.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Already every where, with due repose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Creatures restored their weary spirits; laid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">These upon stones and upon feathers those,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or greensward, in the beech or myrtle’s shade:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But scarcely did thine eyes, Orlando close,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So on thy mind tormenting fancies preyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor would the vexing thoughts which bred annoy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Let thee in peace that fleeting sleep enjoy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To good Orlando it appeared as he,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Mid odorous flowers, upon a grassy bed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were gazing on that beauteous ivory,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which Love’s own hand had tinged with native red;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And those two stars of pure transparency,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With which he in Love’s toils his fancy fed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of those bright eyes, and that bright face, I say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which from his breast had torn his heart away.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He with the fullest pleasure overflows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That ever happy lover did content:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, lo! this time a mighty tempest rose,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wasted flowers, and trees uptore and rent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not with the rage with which this whirlwind blows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Joust warring winds, north, south, and east, unpent.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It seemed, as if in search of covering shade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, vainly wandering, through a desert strayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Meanwhile the unhappy lover lost the dame</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that dim air, nor how he lost her, weets;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, roving far and near, her beauteous name</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through every sounding wood and plain repeats.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And while, “Oh wretched me!” is his exclaim,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Who has to poison changed my promised sweets?”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He of his sovereign lady who with tears</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Demands his aid, the lamentation hears.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thither, whence comes the sound, he swiftly hies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And toils, now here, now there, with labour sore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh! what tormenting grief, to think his eyes</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cannot again the lovely rays explore!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Lo! other voice from other quarter cries⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Hope not on earth to enjoy the blessing more.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-121" id="noteref-121" epub:type="noteref">121</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At that alarming cry he woke, and found</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Himself in tears of bitter sorrow drowned.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not thinking that like images are vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When fear, or when desire disturbs our rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The thought of her, exposed to shame and pain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In such a mode upon his fancy pressed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, thundering, leaped from bed, and with what chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And plate behoved, his limbs all over dressed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Took Brigliadoro from the stall he filled,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor any squire attendant’s service willed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And to pass every where, yet not expose</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By this his dignity to stain or slight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The old and honoured ensign he foregoes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His ancient bearing, quartered red and white.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in its place a sable ensign shows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Perhaps as suited to his mournful plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That erst he from an Amostantes bore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he had slain in fight some time before.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-122" id="noteref-122" epub:type="noteref">122</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>At midnight he departed silently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to his uncle spake, not to his true</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And faithful comrade Brandimart, whom he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So dearly cherished, even bade adieu;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But when, with golden tresses streaming-free,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The sun from rich Tithonus’ inn withdrew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And chased the shades, and cleared the humid air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king perceived Orlando was not there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Charles, to his displeasure, were conveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">News that his nephew had withdrawn at night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When most he lacked his presence and his aid;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor could he curb his choler at the flight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that with foul reproach he overlaid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And sorely threatened the departed knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By him so foul a fault should be repented,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save he, returning home, his wrath prevented.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor would Orlando’s faithful Brandimart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who loved him as himself, behind him stay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether to bring him back he in his heart</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoped, or of him ill brooked injurious say:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scarce, in his impatience to depart,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Till fall of eve his sally would delay.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lest she should hinder his design, of this</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He nought imparted to his Flordelis:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To him this was a lady passing dear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And from whose side he unwont to stray,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Endowed with manners, grace, and beauteous cheer,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wisdom and wit: if now he went away</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And took no leave, it was because the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hoped to revisit her that very day.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that befell him after, as he strayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which him beyond his own intent delayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She when she has expected him in vain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Well nigh a month, and nought of him discerns,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sallies without a guide or faithful train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So with desire of him her bosom yearns:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And many a country seeks for him in vain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom the story in due place returns.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No more I now shall tell you of these two,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More bent Anglantes’ champion to pursue;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who having old Almontes’ blazonry</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So changed, drew nigh the gate; and there the peer</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Approached a captain of the guard, when he;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“I am the County,” whispered in his ear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (the bridge quickly lowered, and passage free</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At his commandment) by the way most near</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went straight towards the foe: but what befell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Him next, the canto which ensues shall tell.</span>

				<p>
					<span>So far Orlando wends, he comes to where</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He of old Proteus’ hears the cruel use</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But feels such pity for Olympia fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wronged by Cymosco, who in prison mews</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her plighted spouse, that ere he makes repair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Further, he gives her hope to venge the abuse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He does so, and departs; and with his spouse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Departs Bireno, to repeat his vows.</span>
				</p>
			</header>
			<p>
				<span>What cannot, when he has a heart possess’d</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This false and cruel traitor Love? since he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can banish from Orlando’s faithful breast</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such tried allegiance and due loyalty?</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wise, full of all regards, and of the blest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And glorious church the champion wont to be,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now, little for himself or uncle, driven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By a vain love, he cares, and less for heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>But I excuse him well, rejoiced to know</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">I have like partner in my vice: for still</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seek my good I too am faint and slow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But sound and nimble in pursuit of ill.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The count departs, disguised in sable show,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for so many friends, with froward will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Deserted cares; and comes where on the plain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Are camped the hosts of Afric and of Spain;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Rather uncamped: for, in less troops or more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rains under shed and tree had driven the band.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Here ten, there twenty, seven or eight, or four,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Near or further off, Orlando scanned.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Each sleeps, oppressed with toil and wearied sore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This stretched on earth, that propped upon his hand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">They sleep, and many might the count have slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet never bared his puissant Durindane.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-123" id="noteref-123" epub:type="noteref">123</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>So generous is Orlando’s heart, he base</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteems it were to smite a sleeping foe.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now this he seeks, and now that other place;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet cannot track his lady, high or low.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If he finds any one in waking case,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sighing, to him he paints her form and show;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Then prays him that for courtesy, he where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The damsel is, will reach him to repair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And when the day its shining light displayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He wholly searched the Moorish army through.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In that the gentle warrior was arrayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Arab weeds, he this might safely do;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And of his purpose came alike in aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That other tongues beside the French he knew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the African so well was read,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seemed in Tripoly one born and bred:</span>
			</p>

				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all their mantling foliage dispossess’d,</span>

				<span class="i1">And in close flights the swarming birds are flown,</span>

				<span class="i1">Which to the neighbouring sea in quiet flows,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bretons and Normans parting on its way:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, swoln with mountain rain and melted snows,</span>

				<span class="i1">Its brim, and burst the bridge, and passage stopt.</span>

			<p>
				<span>The paladin this bank and the other eyed,</span>

				<span class="i1">Along the river’s channel, to explore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since neither fish nor fowl, if from his side</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He could gain footing on the adverse shore;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When, with a damsel in the poop, he spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A ready pinnace that towards him bore:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She steered, as if she would approach the strand;</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">To her the good Orlando made petition</span>
				<br/>

				<span class="i1">And faithful follower, of whom I said,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who moved not till the bridegroom he descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet waited not till he in bed was laid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But raised a hatchet, and so well applied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Behind the stripling’s head the ponderous blade,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of speech and life it reft him; I, who note</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The deed, leap lightly up and cut his throat.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-127" id="noteref-127" epub:type="noteref">127</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“As falls the bullock upon shamble-sill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus fell the ill-starred stripling, in despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of king Cymosco, worst among the ill;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So was the impious king of Friesland hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who did my brothers and my father kill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, in my state to found a better right;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In wedlock wished to join me with his son;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Haply to slay me when his end was won.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Ere new disturbance interrupt the deed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Taking what costliest was and lightest weighed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me my companion by a chord, with speed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Drops from a window, where with boat purveyed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Flanders (as related) for my need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His brother, watchful of our motions, stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">We dip the oar, we loose the sail, and driven</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By both, escape, as was the will of Heaven.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The daring feat achieved, I cannot say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If Friesland’s king more sorrowed for his son,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or raged at me: he there arrived, the day</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Ensuing, where the dreadful deed was done.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Proud he returned, both he and his array,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of the duke taken, and the victory won:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thought to feast and nuptials he was bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But in his home all grief and darkness found.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“His pity for his son, the hate he fed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Towards me, torment the father day and night;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But as lamenting will not raise the dead,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vengeance is a vent for smothered spite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That portion of his thoughts, which should have led</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The king, to ease by sighs his troubled sprite;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now willingly takes counsel with his hate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To seize me, and his vengeance satiate.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“All known or said to by my friends, or who</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Were friends of those that, chosen from my train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had aided me the deadly deed to do,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Their goods and chattels burnt, were doomed or slain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he had killed Bireno, since he knew</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No other trouble could inflict such pain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But that he, saving him in malice, thought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He had a net wherewith I might be caught.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Yet him a cruel proposition made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Granting a year his purpose to complete;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Condemned to privy death, till then delayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save in that time, through force or through deceit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He by his friends’ and kindred’s utmost aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Doing or plotting, me from my retreat</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conveyed into his prisons; so that he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can only saved by my destruction be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“What for his safety could be done, behold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Short of my own destruction, had been tried.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Six towns I had in Flanders: these I sold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And (great or small the produce set aside)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A part of it, to wily persons told,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That it to tempt his guards might be applied;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The rest of it dispensed to move and arm</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Germans or English, to the miscreant’s harm.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“My agents, whether they their trust betrayed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or that they could in truth perform no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me with vain words instead of help have paid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And scorn me, having drained my scanty store:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And now the term is nigh expired, when aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whether of open force or treasured ore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer will arrive in time to save</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">My cherished spouse from torture and the grave.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Through him, from me was my dominion rent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through him, my father and my brethren slain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Through him, the little treasure left me, spent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(What served alone existence to sustain)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To rescue him, in cruel durance pent;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other means to succour him remain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save I, to liberate him from prison, go</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And yield myself to such a cruel foe.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“If nothing more be left me then to try,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor other way for his escape appear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than <em>his</em> with this <em>my</em> wretched life to buy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This life I gladly will lay down: one fear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Alone molests me; and it is that I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Can never my conditions make so clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As to assure me, that with new deceit,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Me, when his prey, the tyrant will not cheat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“I fear, when I shall be in captive plight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And he has put all tortures upon me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He may not loose Bireno, and the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Have not to thank me for his liberty:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like perjured king, and full of foul despite,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with my murder will not satiate be;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But by Bireno neither less nor more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will do, than he had done by me before.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“The occasion now that I confer with you,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And tell my case to all who seek the land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Both lords and knights, is with the single view,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That taking counsel of so large a band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some one may indicate assurance due,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That when before the cruel king I stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">No longer he Bireno shall detain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor, after I am killed, the duke be slain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Warrior to went with me, I in my need,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I shall be to Friesland given, have prayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But so he promise, that the exchange agreed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shall be between us in such manner made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That from his bonds Bireno shall be freed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I am to the monarch’s hands conveyed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thus I, when I am slain, shall die content,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who to my spouse shall life by death have lent:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Not to this day have chanced upon a wight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who on his faith will give me warranty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That if the king refuse to loose the knight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When I am offered, from captivity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will not suffer that in my despite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(So feared those weapons!) I shall taken be.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So feared those weapons, upon every hand!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, howsoever thick, no plates withstand.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“Now, if as strong Herculean port and bold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appear to vouch, such worth to you belong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you believe to give me or withhold</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is in your power, should he intend me wrong;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be with me, when committed to his hold,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since I shall fear not, in your convoy strong,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When you are with me, that my lord, though I</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Be after slain, shall by his order die.”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Here her discourse, wherewith were interposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Loud sobs, the lady ceased, and silent stood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando, when her lips the damsel closed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whose ready will ne’er halts in doing good,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Briefly to her replies, as indisposed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To idle speeches of his natural mood:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But plights his solemn word, that better aid</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She should from him receive than that she prayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis not his scheme to place her in the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of her foul foe, to have Bireno freed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will save both the lovers, if his brand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wonted valour fail him not at need.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Embarked that very day, they put from land</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With a clear sky and prosperous wind to speed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The county hastes in his impatient heat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Eager to reach that isle, the monster’s seat.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Through the still deeps, on this or the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The skipper veered his canvas to the wind:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">This isle, and that of Zealand, they descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">One seen before, and one shut in behind.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-128" id="noteref-128" epub:type="noteref">128</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The third day, from the harboured vessel’s side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Holland, Roland disembarks, not joined</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By the complaining dame; whom to descend</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He will not till she hear that tyrant’s end.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Armed at all points, the county passed ashore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Borne on a horse ’twixt brown and black, the breed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Denmark, but in Flanders nurtured, more</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Esteemed for weight and puissance than for speed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For when the paladin embarked before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In Brittany he left the gallant steed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His Brigliador; so nimble and so fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That but Bayardo could with him compare.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Orlando fares to Dordrecht, where he views</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A numerous squadron, which the gate maintain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As well, because suspicion still ensues</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">On the foundation of a new domain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As that before they had received the news,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That out of Zealand, backed with armed train,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was coming with a fleet of many sail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A cousin of the lord here pent in jail.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One, good Orlando to the monarch’s ear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bade bear a message, “that an errant knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Oh him would prove himself, with sword and spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But would lay down this pact before the fight:⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That if the king unhorsed the cavalier,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her who Arbantes slew, he, as his right,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Should have, that, at the cavalier’s command,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was ready for delivery to his hand;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“And willed the king should on his side agree,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If him the knight in combat overbore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Forthwith released from his captivity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bireno to full freedom to restore.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To him the footman does his embassy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he, who knightly worth or courteous lore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had never known, directs his whole intent</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The count by treacherous fraud to circumvent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He hopes as well, if he the warrior slay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To have the dame, whom, so aggrieved, he hates,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If in the knight’s disposal, and the say</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of that strange knight, the footman well relates.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hence thirty men dispatched by other way</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Than to the portal led, where Roland waits;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who with a long and privy circuit wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And come upon the paladin behind.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He all this while had made his guard delay</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The knight with words, till horse and foot he spied</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Arrived, where he this ambuscade did lay;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">When from the gate he with as many hied:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As is the practised hunter’s wonted way,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To circle wood and beasts on every side:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As nigh Volana, with his sweeping nets,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The wary fisher fish and pool besets.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-129" id="noteref-129" epub:type="noteref">129</a></span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>’Tis thus the king bars every path which lies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Free for the warrior’s flight, with armed train:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He him alive, and in no other guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would have, and lightly hopes his end to gain;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor for the earthly thunderbolt applies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That had so many and so many slain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which here he deems would serve his purpose ill,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where he desires to take and not to kill.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>As wary fowler, bent on greater prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Wisely preserves alive the game first caught,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That by the call-bird and his cheating play,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-130" id="noteref-130" epub:type="noteref">130</a></span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More may within the circling net be brought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such cunning art Cymosco would assay:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But Roland would not be so lightly bought;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Like them by the first toil that springs betrayed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And quickly forced the circle which was made.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Where he perceives the assailants thickest stand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rests his lance, and sticks in his career</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">First one and afterwards another, and</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Another, and another, who appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of paste; till six he of the circling band</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of foes impales upon a single spear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A seventh left out, who by the push is slain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Since the clogged weapon can no more contain.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>No otherwise, upon the further shore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of fosse or of canal, the frogs we spy,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By cautious archer, practised in his lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote and transfixed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-131" id="noteref-131" epub:type="noteref">131</a> the one the other nigh;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the shaft, until it hold no more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From barb to feathers full, allowed to lie.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The heavy lance Orlando from him flung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to close combat with his faulchion sprung.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The lance now broke, his sword the warrior drew,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That sword which never yet was drawn in vain,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And still with cut or thrust some soldier slew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Now horse, now footman of the tyrant’s train.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, ever where he dealt a stroke, changed blue,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yellow, green, white and black, to crimson stain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cymosco grieves, when most his need require,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not to have now his hollow cane and fire;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And with loud voice and menacing command</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bids these be brought, but ill his followers hear;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For those who have found safety of his band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To issue from the city are in fear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He, when he sees them fly on either hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would fly as well from that dread cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Makes for the gate, and would the drawbridge lift,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But the pursuing county is too swift.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The monarch turns his back, and leaves the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Lord of the drawbridge and of either gate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thanks to his swifter steed, the rest in flight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He passes: good Orlando will not wait</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">(Intent the felon, not his band, to smite)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the vulgar herd to wreck his hate.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But his slow horse seems restive; while the king’s,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">More nimble, flies as if equipt with wings.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>From street to street, before the count he made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vanished clean; but after little stay,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Came with new arms, with tube and fire purveyed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which, at his hest, this while his men convey.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And posted at a corner, he waylaid:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His foe, as hunter watches for his prey,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In forest, with armed dogs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-132" id="noteref-132" epub:type="noteref">132</a> and spear, attending</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The boar in fury from the hill descending,</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Who rends the branch and overthrows the stone;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And wheresoe’er he turns his haughty front,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Appears (so loud the deafening crash and groan)</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As if he were uprending wood and mount,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Intent to make him his bold deed atone,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cymosco at the pass expects the count;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As soon as he appears, with ready light</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Touches the hole, and fires upon the knight.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Behind, the weapon flames in lightning’s guise,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And vents the thunder from before; the ground</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Shakes under foot and city wall; the skies</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The fearful echo all about rebound.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The burning bolt with sudden fury flies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not sparing aught which in its course is found.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Hissing and whizzing through the skies it went;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But smote not, to the assassin’s foul intent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Whether it was his great desire to kill</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">That baron, or his hurry made him fail,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or trembling heart, like leaf which flutters still,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Made hand and arm together flinch and quail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Or that it was not the Creator’s will</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The church so soon her champion should bewail;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The glancing stroke his courser’s belly tore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Outstretched on earth, from thence to rise no more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To earth fall horse and rider: this the knight</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Scarce touched; the other thundering pressed the plain:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For the first rose so ready and so light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He from the fall seemed breath and force to gain.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As African Anteus, in the fight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Rose from the sand with prouder might and main;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So when Orlando touched the ground, to view</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He rose with doubled force and vigour new.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>He who has seen the thunder, from on high,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Discharged by Jove with such a horrid sound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Descend where nitre, coal, and sulphur lie,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Stored up for use in magazine profound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which scarce has reached⁠—but touched it, ere the sky</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Is in a flame, as well as burning ground,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Firm walls are split, and solid marbles riven,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And flying stones cast up as high as heaven;</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Let him imagine, when from earth he sprung,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Such was the semblance of the cavalier;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who moved in mode to frighten Mars among</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Gods, so fierce and horrid was his cheer.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">At this dismay’d, the King of Friesland stung</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His horse, and turned his rein, to fly the peer:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But fierce Orlando was upon his foe</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Faster than arrow flies from bended bow:</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And, what before he could not, when possest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of his good courser, now afoot will do.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His speed outgoes all thought in every breast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Exceeds all credence, save in those who view.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The tyrant shortly joined, he on the crest</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Smote at his head so well, he cleft it through;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And to the neck divided by the blow,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sent it, to shake its last on earth below.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Lo! in the frighted city other sound</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Was heard to rise, and other crash of brands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">From troop, who, thither in his guidance bound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Followed Bireno’s cousin from his lands:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who, since the unguarded gates he open found,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Into the city’s heart had poured his bands;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Where the bold paladin had struck such fear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He without let might scour it far and near.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>In rout the people fly, who cannot guess</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who these may be, or what the foes demand:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But, when this man and that by speech and dress</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As Zealand-men distinguishes the band,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Carte blanche they proffer, and the chief address,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bidding him range them under his command;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Against the Frieslanders to lend him aid,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Who have their duke in loathsome prison stayed.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To Friesland’s king that people hatred bore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With all his following: who their ancient lord</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Had put to death, and who by them yet more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As evil and rapacious, was abhorred.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Orlando interposed with kindly lore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As friend of both, the parties to accord:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By whom, so joined, no Frieslander was left</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But was of life or liberty bereft.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>They would not wait to seek the dungeon-key,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But breaking-down the gate, their entrance made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bireno to the count with courtesy</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And grateful thanks the service done repaid.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thence they, together with large company,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Went where Olympia in her vessel stayed:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For so was the expecting lady hight,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To whom that island’s crown belonged of right.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>She who had thither good Orlando brought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Not hoping that he would have thriven so well;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">—Enough for her, if by her misery bought,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her spouse were rescued from the tyrant’s cell!⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Her, full of love and loyal homage, sought</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The people one and all: ’Twere long to tell</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">How she caressed Bireno, he the maid⁠—</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What thanks both lovers to the county paid.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The people, throned in her paternal reign,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Replace the injured dame, and fealty swear:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">She on the duke, to whom in solid chain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Love with eternal knot had linked the fair,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The empire of herself and her domain</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Conferred: He, called away by other care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Left in the cousin’s guardian care this while</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His fortresses, and all the subject isle.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Since he to visit Zealand’s duchy planned,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">His faithful consort in his company;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And thence, upon the king of Friesland’s land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Would try his fortune (as he said), for he</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">A pledge, he rated highly, had in hand,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which seemed of fair success the warranty,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The daughter of the king: who here forsaken,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">With many others had been prisoner taken.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>To a younger brother, her, the duke pretends,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To be conjoined in wedlock, he conveyed.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The Roman senator<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-133" id="noteref-133" epub:type="noteref">133</a> thence parting wends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Upon the very day Bireno weighed;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But he to nothing else his hand extends</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of all the many, many prized made,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Save to that engine, found amid the plunder,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Which in all points I said resembled thunder.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Not with intent, in his defence to bear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">What he had taken, of the prize possest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For he still held it an ungenerous care</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To go with vantage on whatever quest:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But with design to cast the weapon where</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">It never more should living wight molest;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And, what was appertaining to it, all</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Bore off as well, the powder and the ball.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And thus, when of the tidesway he was clear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And in the deepest sea his bark descried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that no longer distant signs appear</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of either shore on this or the other side,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He seized the tube, and said: “That cavalier</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">May never vail through thee his knightly pride,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor base be rated with a better foe,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Down with thee to the darkest deep below!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>“O loathed, O cursed piece of enginery,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Cast in Tartarean bottom, by the hand</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Of Beelzebub, whose foul malignity</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The ruin of this world through thee has planned!</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">To hell, from whence thou came, I render thee.”</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So said, he cast away the weapon; fanned</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Meanwhile, with flowing sheet, his frigate goes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">By wind, which for the cruel island blows.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Such was the paladin’s desire to explore</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If in the place his missing lady were;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Whom he prefers the united world before,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Nor can an hour of life without her bear.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">He fears, if he set foot on Ireland’s shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Some other chance may interrupt him there:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">So that he after have in vain to say,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">“Why hasted I no faster on my way?”</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Nor he in England nor in Ireland port</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Will make, nor on the coast that’s opposite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But let him go, the naked archer’s sport,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Sore smitten in the heart!⁠—ere I indite</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Yet more of him, to Holland I resort,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">And you to hear me company invite.</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">For well I wot that you as well as me</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">’Twould grieve <em>that</em> bridal should without us be.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Sumptuous and fair the bridal there is made;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But neither yet so sumptuous nor so fair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">As it will be in Zealand, it is said:</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">But ’tis not my design you should repair</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">Thither; since by new accidents delayed</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">The feast will be, of which be it my care,</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">In other strain, the tidings to report;</span>
				<br/>
				<span class="i1">If you to hear that other strain resort.</span>

					<p>The idea of miraculous fountains, (originating probably in the physical effects of some waters,) seems to have been a favourite classical fiction, as exemplified in the two springs in Boeotia, of which one was supposed to increase, and the other to take away, the memory. The belief in these was rife during the middle ages, and indeed extended to a later period; as we find the early discoverers reported, among other wonders, a fountain of youth.</p>
					<p>It is possible, moreover, that with the idea of Claudian’s two fountains may have been mixed up that of Cupid’s two arrows, one of lead and the other of gold; of which the golden one was supposed to instil love, and the leaden hate. <a href="canto-1.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Those who have been taught that the strength of the ancient English armies consisted in their infantry, will be startled at the mention of mounted archers; but Ariosto is here perfectly right. The English archer (at least latterly) was mounted; but made use of his horse only as a vehicle, as originally was the practice of the dragoon, who, when in action, fought as a foot-soldier. The English archers, indeed, were the yeomanry of the country, and wholly unlike the naked rabble of peasants, who composed the infantry of the other European nations. Hence they were allowed one horse per man (as we find in Anderson’s History of Commerce), and sixpence a day, at the time of the battle of Agincourt, being one half of the pay of the esquire or man-at-arms: an allowance which, notwithstanding the depreciation of money, continued to be the stipend of our foot-soldier till within these few years. <a href="canto-10.xhtml#noteref-139" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>We have here a short but sufficiently precise description of the chieftain of a clan, whether highlander or borderer: for it is to be observed, that the southern provinces of Scotland, and indeed the neighbouring English counties, afforded the same examples of such a patriarchal species of authority. This seems to have been clearly of Celtic origin: for the English and Scottish borders were, as well as the highlands, peopled by a tribe of this race, the remnants of Arthur’s kingdom, which extended as far as from North Wales to Cumberland in England, and the parallel counties in Scotland. The cause, however, of clanship being <em>maintained</em> in this line, as well as in the Highlands, is probably to be found in the analogous state of society presented by both districts. Such a custom as clanship would hardly be preserved in any country, after the necessity for it had ceased. Now this <em>had</em> ceased under the increasing civilization of the other Celtic provinces; but was yet in force in those, whose pacification had been retarded by moral or physical accidents. In these, clanship was the best protection which could be had in a state of <em>neighbour warfare</em>.</p>
					<p>It may excite surprise that no mention is anywhere made of the Highland garb, which might have been turned to some account in this picture; but it must be recollected that the Highlanders do not appear to have been much considered in the time of Ariosto; and indeed may be said to have first risen into consideration by the glorious part they played in Montrose’s wars. <a href="canto-10.xhtml#noteref-140" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>So ends this beautiful, though strange episode, made up of classical and Gothic fictions, and in which figure the champion of Christendom, and the heathen god Proteus, who is described as exercising all the powers of an angry and puissant divinity. One of the late translators of the Furioso, in commenting upon this canto of his author’s seems here to think him indefensible; and what would justly be thought so glaring an offence against costume in a modern, will probably be deemed in the eyes of many, a defect in Ariosto. But those many, who judge by rule, should, on their own principles, have regard to authority: and by what many and weighty authorities may he not be justified? To come near to our own times; is not the mixture in Lycidas, of “the pilot of the Galilean lake,” and of heathen gods and goddesses, “Sleek Panope, with all her sisters,” and “old Hippotades,” shepherds and bishops, a more anomalous assemblage than that which we find in the story of Olympia? Yet who could wish, except those who pride themselves as philosophical critics, that Milton had conformed to our modern notions of propriety, or who of real poetical feeling subscribes to the censure which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Johnson has pronounced upon this exquisite poem? But if I have been tempted to recur to authority, I ought to confess it is not by authorities that Ariosto is generally to be estimated.

It appears, to sum his story in a few words, that the wall on the side where the Moors attacked was surrounded by a <em>wet</em> ditch, through which Rodomont plunged at the head of the storming party, scaled the wall, and carried the <i xml:lang="it">bertesca</i>, or wooden platform, placed within it and near its summit. Beyond this work, it seems, was a second wall, or dyke, divided from the first by a <em>dry</em> ditch, into which Rodomont drives his party of assailants, urging them to the assault of the interior wall, and he himself leaping the ditch, and, like Alexander at the siege of Oxydracae, mounting the last defence, and springing from it into the city. His followers, in the meantime, while planting their ladders against the interior wall in this second moat, are consumed by combustibles, with which it had been previously filled by the Parisians. Rodomont, it is to be recollected, had escaped the effects of the explosion by his desperate leap, and is left enclosed in the middle of the city. <a href="canto-14.xhtml#noteref-193" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

It is distinguished as having been taken in the Burgundian wars, and as having been a place of battle between the royalists and leaguers. It is, however, yet more familiar to the Parisians from having been celebrated by Boileau, in the opening of the third canto of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Lutrin</i>, who makes it the birthplace of his owl. His lines will be duly estimated by every one who has travelled a long time within sight of a tower, from which it seems impossible to escape, and that of Montlheri may indeed be considered as the most <em>enduringly</em> visible of all towers, being built on an eminence in a country generally flat.</p>

I may here remark with what felicity and discrimination he always paints the character of woman; the fidelity and fondness of Isabella, the coquetry of Angelica, the exalted character of Olympia, uncompromising in her love or hate, and the abandoned wickedness of Gabrina, a true though fearful picture of what woman is, when she utterly abandons the reins to her passions. This discrimination appears to me strikingly exemplified in the character of his two viragos. Bradamant and Marphisa, though equally brave, and, by the vagrant and unfeminine life which they lead, equally subjected to the same coarse suspicions, always appear to us in very different lights. The mere circumstance of his having armed one with a golden spear, with which she tilts her enemies out of their saddles, and the other with a sabre to hack and hew, makes all the difference.

Don Quixote is never so interesting as at the Duke’s, nor the Spectator as at Sir Roger de Coverley’s. Shakespeare, when he has almost worn out Falstaff, presents him to us as fresh as ever, eating a dish of caraways and pippins in Master Shallow’s orchard; and though hardly anything remarkable is said or done by either of them, we delight in watching Gil Blas and Scipio at <em>Lirias</em>, and contemplate them with pleasure when taking their siesta under its shades. <a href="canto-23.xhtml#noteref-276" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

They are not, after all, so bad a substitute for something better, as might be conceived; and the mountain peasantry of warm countries (to their praise be it spoken!) will accommodate themselves to worse provision. The inhabitants of the Tuscan Apennines make the fruit of the <em>wild chestnut</em> (I am not sure that it is the same as our horse chestnut) and ground pulse into bread; and the traveller, in a season of scarcity, may find beech leaves boiling in their pots, as an esculent vegetable. <a href="canto-24.xhtml#noteref-277" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

English critics are disposed to believe that this was much more outrageous in Italy than in England, and the writer of an article upon my translation in the Quarterly Review attributes this to the supposed licentiousness which succeeded the great plague at Florence, Reasoning, however, as all our commentators do, from the great scandal afforded by Italian literature of this period, he overlooks <em>that</em> given by our own writers.

					<p>All the commentators have explained this monster to mean Avarice, which had overrun the Christian world. Sir John Harrington, who lived in an age of allegory, says, that Ariosto describes this vice very significantly; he makes “her ugly, because of all vices it is most hateful; ears of an ass, being for the most part ignorant, or at least careless of other men’s good opinions; a wolf in head and breast, namely, ravenous and never satisfied; a lion’s grisly jaw, terrible and devouring; a fox in all the rest, wily and crafty.”</p>
					<p>He might have brought other proofs in support of his opinion, as the scandal which the Beast had brought upon the papal court, and as arrogating to itself the keys of Heaven, <abbr>etc.</abbr> in which Ariosto (who, as has been said, though a Catholic, was no Papist) manifestly satirizes the sale of indulgences.

					<p>Though this episode is distinguished by that felicity of expression and neatness of narration so peculiarly characteristic of Ariosto, I cannot think it deserving of all the encomiums which have been bestowed upon it. It is, as I conceive, deficient in that dramatic truth which is equally characteristic of his style, and is generally so well observed by him. What, for instance, can be more extravagant than the conception of the leading incident? We may almost say, that extreme hypocrisy and extreme debauchery are never found together; for there are always some dregs of truth, however muddy, at the bottom of hypocrisy. If this be true, the character of the wife is not in nature; but supposing her character to be in nature, how can we imagine that a husband, who was tied to her apron-string, should never have entertained the least suspicion of her perverse predilection? Is it not yet more extravagant to suppose that this abused husband, who had surprised her in <i xml:lang="la">flagranti delicto</i>, and who was at first about to kill both her and her paramour, should be seized with such a sudden qualm of morbid sensibility as not even to disturb her slumbers?</p>
					<p>The last act of extravagance in this little piece, the return of king and cavalier to the adulteresses, with whom they live very happy ever afterwards, is less out of nature, and is besides justified by its epigrammatic spirit. <a href="canto-28.xhtml#noteref-358" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>That there are some preparations which for a time secure the skin from fire there is no doubt, and we cannot much wonder it should have been believed in a more ignorant age, that what preserved from one danger would preserve from another. In Constantinople, where things have remained (as has been before said) much in the same state as they were in Christendom down to the fifteenth century, a frequent exhibition takes place of dervishes who handle red hot irons with impunity; and every now and then we have some chance performer on the same strange instruments at home.</p>
					<p>In these performances there may be some trick, as in the apparent swallowing of molten lead, which is probably some other composite metal capable of fusion by an inferior degree of heat, a thing which is sometimes witnessed in the partial dissolution of an alehouse teaspoon in a hot cup of tea; but making every reasonable allowance for deception, no one can doubt the main fact, who has witnessed these performances, which certainly offer a reasonable ground for believing that all the strange tricks of natural magic which we read of in works of the middle ages were not such mere hocus pocus as our modern natural philosophers would persuade us; and the thing on which I have been commenting may show how oddly secrets may be preserved among the ignorant, which elude all the researches of the educated. <a href="canto-29.xhtml#noteref-359" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>An Italian commentator attacks Ariosto for having first stated that one nameless herb, boiled with rue and ivy, was sufficient for Isabella’s purpose, and then for making her collect many others for this magic bath. I should not have thought the criticism worth notice, if the circumstance did not illustrate a fact in the history of manners, or rather of art. In the earlier ages of Europe, all composers of medicine dealt largely in compound drugs, and never used that on which they most relied without other auxiliary ingredients. The great improvers of medicine were inclined to treat this complication of remedies as an imposture. But better experience seems to prove that our ancestors were right in the principle, however inefficient or erroneous may have been their practice. For it is now well ascertained that the happy union of drugs is one of the most useful points of medicine; and that even preparations of the same ingredient which offend when taken separately, will sometimes produce a beneficial effect when administered in combination. <a href="canto-29.xhtml#noteref-360" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The English reader can only find some palliation for this passage in the spirit of Ariosto’s age and country. As a specimen, indeed, of the different feeling with which his countrymen have contemplated it, it is enough to translate literally the note of one who has furnished many observations upon the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, not worse than those of other critics. “The poet” (say he) “uses the oath which the Gentiles put into the mouths of the their Gods, in making them swear by the waters of Styx; an oath which was held by them as inviolable. Ariosto <em>poetically</em> puts this into the mouth of the true God, to show the unalterable firmness of his purpose!”</p>
					<p>Putting aside these indefensible scandals, it is to be observed that Ariosto too often loses himself when he touches the dangerous chord of compliment; but I can say with truth, that after a long and close consideration of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, I am convinced little could safely be abridged in this extraordinary poem besides these complimentary effusions. Everything else has its use, and is conducive to some dramatic, if not poetical, effect.

						<p>“It may not be amiss to take a little retrospect, in order to see how the matter was settled by Agramant, which seems rather to require some explanation. By the first lots that were drawn, the combatants stood thus: first, Rodomont and Rogero: fourth, Mandricardo and Marphisa. The list being prepared for the fight between Rodomont and Mandricardo, while these knights are arming themselves, a new dispute arises between them and Gradasso and Sacripant for Durindana and Frontina, which puts a stop to the expected combat between Rodomont and Mandricardo. Marphisa adds to the confusion by carrying off Brunello prisoner, whom she accuses of stealing her sword; and Rogero seeing the order of the lots disturbed, claims again his horse from Rodomont. Agramant, to settle the first dispute between Rodomont and Mandricardo, orders the cause to be determined by Doralice, who, choosing Mandricardo her former lover, quits the camp with indignation. The list now remained according to the first lots, to be entered by Rogero and Mandricardo, but Gradasso persisting still to claim Durindana from Mandricardo, Agramant proposes that lots should be again drawn to determine whether Rogero or Gradasso should first engage with Mandricardo, and, to prevent future strife, proposes that whoever draws the lot of combat, shall determine both his own claim and the claim of the knight who loses the lot; that when Rogero wins or loses, he shall not only win or lose the eagle for himself, but Gradasso shall, in right of his conquest, or in consequence of his defeat, continue to bear the shield of Hector, or relinquish the claim. In this last disposition of the lots, no provision seems to be made for the termination of Marphisa’s quarrel with Mandricardo.”</p>

					<p class="continued">The followers of the mystic philosophers in the age of Ariosto and that of Milton seem to have believed in the existence of two worlds, one of things and the other of types, perhaps from too literal an interpretation of doctrines which were purely allegorical; and it appears that some of the interpreters of the Pythagorean philosophy imagined the seventh sphere of their master to be the moon (Ariosto’s land of types). It is, at any rate, clear, that much of the mystery of the present canto, the preexistent souls, “the sisters three, and such branches of learning,” savour strongly of Platonic and Pythagorean doctrines. <a href="canto-35.xhtml#noteref-436" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Harrington only says that his “author here follows not any true story, but a work entitled Almontes, which, notwithstanding, hath some credit, though not much:” but Hoole finds the dramatis personae among those of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Innamorato</i>, and those that “jousted in Aspramont;” and gives the following account of them: “After the Grecians had taken Troy, and put most of their prisoners to the sword, among whom was Polyxena, daughter of Priam and Hecuba, who was sacrificed at the tomb of Achilles; in order entirely to extirpate the race of Hector, they sought for Astyanax, but Andromache, to preserve his life, concealed him in a sepulchre, and took another child in her arms, with whom being found, they were both put to death. In the meantime the real Astyanax was safely conveyed, by a friend of his father, to the island of Sicily, when, being grown to man’s estate, he conquered Corinth and Argos; he established a government at Messina, and married the queen of Syracuse, but was afterward killed by treachery, and his widow being driven from the city by the Greeks, took shelter in Risa, where she was delivered of a son named Polydore, from whom descended Clovis and Constantius. Constantius was the head of the line of Pepin, father of Charlemagne; and from Clovis came Rogero, who married Galaciëlla, daughter of Agolant. Rogero being cruelly murdered and his city destroyed, his wife fled to the coast of Africa, where she was delivered of two children, a boy and a girl, and died soon after; the boy, called Rogero, was brought up by Atlantes, a magician.”⁠—See <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Orlando <abbr>Innam.</abbr></i> <abbr>b.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> <abbr>c.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
					<p>Take his further account of Rogero of Risa and Galaciëlla, the father and mother of Ariosto’s hero:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“When Almontes left the dominions of his father Agolant to revenge the death of King Garnieri on the Christians, he took with him his sister Galaciëlla, a female warrior of great courage, but his brother Troyano remained behind with his father. Almontes and Galaciëlla alternately fought with Rogero of Risa, without victory to any party. Galaciëlla turned Christian and married Rogero; but Bertram, elder natural brother to Rogero, having conceived a passion for his sister-in-law, but unable to corrupt her chastity, he in revenge betrayed the town of Risa to Almontes, who entering by night, put all to the sword. Rogero and his father Rampaldo were killed: but Almontes afterward, repenting of the part which he had acted, caused Bertram to be put to death. Galaciëlla, then big with child, was put on board a vessel with eight attendants, whom she afterwards killed, and landing at a castle, was delivered of two children, and died.”</p>

In ascribing to him, therefore, the sentiments and conduct which he exhibits in the text, Ariosto has probably ascribed to him the quality that was most popular in his time, and has thus unwittingly pronounced the most damning satire on the morals of his age. For allegiance to person or party, exclusive of principle, is surely the most vulgar, as well as the most exceptionable, of all generous propensities, and Rogero might probably be outdone in his equivocal generosity by many of the tenants of every gaol in Christendom. <a href="canto-40.xhtml#noteref-478" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Another, who is also blinded, and who is also fastened to the pivot by another cord, has <em>a small bell</em> in his hand, which he occasionally rings, and which serves as a guide to the other, whose business it is to catch him; and who, if he succeeds in this, beats him with his knotted handkerchief.

					<p>Leo’s romantic generosity to Rogero, and injustice and cruelty to his jailer, will, perhaps, to many, hardly seem, consistent with the chivalric character with which Ariosto has invested him; I think, however, to speak familiarly, that the poet knew what he was about, and that the conduct of Leo is not to be considered as unnatural; indeed it differs little from that of the most chivalric of our monarchs upon a very memorable occasion. Leo honours and benefits the knight who has waged desperate war upon his father and himself, and murders the burgher-Castellain, against every principle of justice and humanity. Edward <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> threatened with death, with the apparent intention of executing his threat, six citizens of Calais, who had done their duty by assisting in the defence of their town against him in legitimate warfare; and afterwards honoured and rewarded a troop of knights who treacherously attacked it, and failed in their enterprise; men whose conduct might have justified his severest rigour on their falling into his power. <a href="canto-45.xhtml#noteref-541" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

He was secretary to Isabella d’Este, Marchioness Gonzaga of Mantua, of whom Ariosto makes a splendid panegyric, canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> <abbr>st.</abbr> 59, et <abbr>seq.</abbr>, to her husband Francis, and to her son Frederick, with whom Mario was besieged in Pavis.</p>
					<p>Piètro Aretìno. The basest and most impudent wretch that ever lived, author of the Ragionamenti Puliana Errante, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> He called himself “<i xml:lang="it">divino</i>” and “<i xml:lang="it">flagello de’ principi</i>,” but none ever flattered them more barefacedly. He attacked in the most scurrilous manner all those from whom he had nothing to fear. He took his name from Arezzo, his native place, being a bastard. His father was, it is said, Luigi Bacci.</p>
					<p>Girolamo Verità is said to have been an elegant poet, and a man fond of scientific pursuits.</p>
					<p>Girolamo Cittadìno was a friend of Bembo, who, in a letter, praises two sonnets of his. He lived at Ferrara, as I learn from Bandello, in the service of Ippolita Sforza, mentioned above, <abbr>st.</abbr> 4. Giovio praises him as a good Latin poet.</p>
					<p>Niccolò Leonicèno, a distinguished physician, of great learning, an elegant writer of Latin verses, when young, and of a most pure life. He was one of the first who dared to question the authority of Pliny, and died, 96 years old, at Ferrara, in 1524.</p>
					<p>Giovanni Manardi, a physician of note. He travelled much, and was one of the first who boldly appealed to reason and observation instead of authority, as may be seen from the first of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Epistolarum Medicinalium</i>, already quoted.</p>
					<p>Benedetto Tagliacarne, or Teocrèno (as he chose to call himself), was named tutor to the son of Francis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> of France, who appointed him to the bishopric of Grasse. Teocrèno had spoken slightly of Erasmus; and hence we may understand why Olivarius called him a pedant. He is generally considered to have been a learned man.</p>
					<p>Cèlio Calcagnini, a learned man, but an affected writer, highly esteemed by Erasmus. Before Copernicus published his astronomical system in 1543, Calcagnini published a book to demonstrate “<i xml:lang="la">quod coelum stet, terra autem moveatur</i>.” Having followed the cardinal d’Este to Hungary, he was appointed professor of literature at Ferrara on his return; whilst Ariosto, who did not like to go, lost his eminence’s good graces. Calcagnini is also praised above, canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLII</span> <abbr>st.</abbr> 90.</p>
					<p>Niccolò Maria, or Mario Panizzato, of Ferrara; a poet of some note, according to Giraldi. He was professor of literature in that city, and it has been said that Ariosto studied under him. <a href="canto-46.xhtml#noteref-571" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Bernardo Capello, a Venetian nobleman, and a pupil of Bembo. He was iniquitously banished by the Council of <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> on account of his freedom of speech in the senate. He went to Rome, where he was well received by Cardinal Farnese, and died an exile. His lyric poetry is excellent. He was a poet, not a timid imitator of Petrarch.</p>
					<p>Pietro Bembo, a Venetian, whose family ranked among the very first of that proud republic. He was a learned and accomplished man, of a kind and amiable disposition. He wrote the most Ciceronian Latin, and his name stands very high in the annals of Italian literature. He deserves more credit for the patronage which he granted to literature than for his own works. He was, with Sadoleto, secretary to Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>; and to this excellent colleague he owed his cardinalship, as it was only by his intercession that Paul <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> was induced to pass over Bembo’s juvenile levities. He was then bishop, first of Gubbio, and afterwards of Bergamo.</p>
					<p>Gaspar Obizzi, a friend of Bembo, who addressed to him his fifty-eighth sonnet, praising his poetry. I do not know whether he was the one who married Ginevra Malatesta, mentioned above, stanza 5.</p>
					<p>Girolamo Fracastòro, whose name is well known as that of a man who in his Latin poem <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="la">De Morbo Gallico</i> vied with Virgil. Fracastòro was, moreover, a great physician, zoologist, astronomer, and geographer. He is said to have been the first to use a kind of telescope to observe the stars. He was highly respected and esteemed by all those who knew him, for his kind and generous disposition.</p>
					<p>Agostino Bevazzano, or Beazzano, a great friend of Bembo, who introduced him to Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, by whom he was patronised. He was an indifferent Italian poet, but wrote very elegant Latin verses.</p>
					<p>Trifon Gabriello, of a patrician family of Venice, is celebrated as a learned and upright man. A sonnet of his to Bembo, which is printed, gives a very poor opinion of his poetical talents. Bernardo Tasso confesses himself highly indebted to his suggestions respecting his poem <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Amadigi</i>.</p>
					<p>Bernardo Tasso, father of Torquato, a distinguished lyric poet, peculiarly soft and sweet, and the author of a romanesque poem, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Amadigi</i>, in 100 cantos, in which he tried to surpass Ariosto. Although he failed in this, the work is full of poetry. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Furioso</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Innamorato</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Morgante</i>, and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Amadigi</i> are the best poems of this class.

					<p>Niccolò Tiepolo, of a patrician family of Venice, was honoured by Pope Julius <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, who conferred upon him the degree of doctor with his own hands, as, according to Bembo, in a letter to the duchess of Ferrara, the famous Lucrezia Borgia, he had given proofs “<i xml:lang="it">d’essere il più valente disputante e filosofo che per avventura in Italia oggi sia</i>.”</p>
					<p>Niccolò Amanio is mentioned by Bandello in his first novel, who calls him “<i xml:lang="it">dotto Dottore e soavissimo poeta</i>.”</p>
					<p>Antonio Fulgoso, or Fregoso, or Campofregoso, of a patrician family of Genoa, and whese relation, Federigo Fulgoso, was mentioned in so friendly and playful a manner by Ariosto, canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLII</span> stanza 20. Antonio wrote some Latin verses now forgotten, and was surnamed <i xml:lang="la">Fileremo</i>, on account of his fondness of seclusion.</p>
					<p>Giovanni Francesco Valerio, an illegitimate son of a nobleman of the patrician family Valerio of Venice. He was a prelate, and was put to death as a traitor to his republic, for having bribed the secretaries of the senate, and communicated the secrets of the state to the Turks. A volume of tales which he wrote was never published; and I consider it fortunate for young readers, as one may deduce from the story of <em>Fiammetta</em>, the merit of which Ariosto attributes to him.⁠—See canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVII</span> stanza 137, and canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVIII</span> stanza 78.

					<p>Gian Francesco Pico, Lord of Mirandola, son of the famous Giovanni Pico, had as much talent as his uncle, and used it much better. He was one of the most learned men of his day, and highly esteemed by his cotemporaries.</p>
					<p>Alberto Pio, Lord of Carpi, son of a sister of Giovanni Pico, aunt of Gian Francesco. He was a learned man, and a great patron of literature. His name is connected with that of Erasmus, on account of a theological dispute which took place between them. He was accused of having excited Leo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, to make war on the Duke of Ferrara, who eventually succeeded in depriving Pio of his dominions. It is remarkable that Ariosto, living at the court of Ferrara, could so nobly praise Pio, who appears to have been a great friend of his.</p>
					<p>Jacopo Sannazzaro, who, on entering the academy of Pontano, changed, according to the fashion of the day, his christian name for that of Azzio Sincero. He was one of the first, about the end of the fifteenth century, who returned to the elegance and sweetness of Petrarch’s language. He wrote eclogues, some describing the life and costumes of shepherds, some of fishermen:⁠—but we must remember he spoke of fishermen in the bay of Naples. He was equal to Vida, and some even say to Fracastòro, in his Latin poems, of which that <i xml:lang="la">De Partu Virginis</i> is the most celebrated, and very justly so.

She was afterwards delivered of Theseus, who, being grown up, took the sword and sandals deposited with Etra by his father, and went to Athens, where he found all the city in confusion by the machinations of Medea, who, at the arrival of Theseus, made him suspected by Egeus, and persuaded the king to destroy him at a banquet by poison; but fortunately, as the youth reached out his hand to receive the cup, Egeus perceived his sword, and, embracing him, acknowledged him for his son.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Introduction</h2>
			<p>It will, probably, be expected that a new translation of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Furioso</i> should be prefaced by some account of the versions which have preceded it; and I the more readily undertake this little task, as in the execution of it my reasons will be found for the enterprise upon which I have myself adventured.</p>
			<p>The first version of Ariosto’s great poem was made by Sir John Harrington, the godson of Queen Elizabeth, who translated it into the same stanza as that of the original. The main defect of this work is its infidelity; and I cannot better illustrate this than by observing, that he has compressed a canto of nearly two hundred stanzas into ninety. A more unpardonable defect is, that he always omits what is best worth preserving; and, as an Italian friend once observed to me, it is the poetry of Ariosto which he sacrifices. Another defect of this translator is that of exaggerating the extravagances of his author, and often spreading a ray of humour into a broad glare of buffoonery.</p>
			<p>The history of his work may explain these faults, and more especially the last; as we are told he began his labours with the story of Giocondo, without the intention of pursuing them further; when his royal mistress imposed upon him the entire version of the Furioso as a sort of covering for the indecent episode which he had chosen to give as a specimen of the Italian.</p>
			<p>If, however, Harrington cannot pretend to much merit as a translator, he has some claims to consideration as a writer, and his work has fallen into more obscurity than the antiquated language in which he writes, will serve to explain. His idioms, his grammar, and his construction (though things with difficulty kept free from foreign modes of speech in a translation) are exclusively English. His narrative is light and lively, and, in perusing it, the reader always feels as if he is swimming with the stream.</p>
			<p>The gleam of Italian sunshine, during which he wrote, though it produced beneficial effects upon our literature, was of short duration.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“At one stride came the dark.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The study of Italian letters was dropped at once, and I believe that no traces of literary intercourse between Italy and England are to be found during the succeeding age.</p>
			<p>In the reign of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, however, we have a proof of renewed intercourse in the publication of a new translation of the Furioso, dedicated to that monarch, as Harrington’s version had been to Queen Elizabeth. This work was produced by William Huggins, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>, of Headly Park, near Farnham, in Surrey. He was, I am told, reckoned in his day a very learned man, was passionately devoted to music, said to be a great proficient in it, and to have been the person who figures in Hogarth’s picture, as the Enraged Musician.</p>
			<p>But, whatever other accomplishments he may have possessed, he had certainly no feeling of poetry, and seems to have taken it up as Vernon did rebellion; “because it lay in his way.” At least I know no better reason for his translation of Ariosto than his having made a journey to Italy.</p>
			<p>The title-page of his book (in two <abbr>vols.</abbr> quarto), bears the date of 1757, and was printed for Rivington in Paternoster Row, and John Cook, a bookseller of Farnham, whose shop I remember frequenting in the days of my boyhood. It is printed with the English and Italian confronted, executed in the same stanza as Harrington’s version, and translated line for line. Though there are to be found in it some very strange mistakes of Ariosto’s meaning, it is, generally speaking, faithful, and as such, has prima facie, strong claims upon attention. But a species of fidelity is hardly to be coveted, which, at the best, does not accomplish the only end which should be proposed by it. For the translator often departs from the sense of the author, while he echoes his very words. Take an instance. Ariosto has this line</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem" xml:lang="it">
				<p>
					<span>“Dove presso à Bordea mette Caronna;”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="continued">“where the Garonne disembogues itself near Bordeaux:” which Huggins has rendered,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>Where to Bordea runs Caronna near.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The thing, perhaps, most worthy of remark in his book, is a passage of the Preface, which throws a curious light upon the state of Italian literature in England at the period of its publication. “It may not be improper (says the author) to observe, that after this work was pretty far advanced, I was informed there had been a translation published in the reign of Elizabeth, and dedicated to that queen. Whereupon I requested a friend to obtain a sight of that book; for it is (it seems) very scarce, <em>and the glorious original much more so in this country</em>.”</p>
			<p>A few years produced a singular revolution in this respect. Several editions of Ariosto have since that period been published in England; and Hoole’s version, the next which succeeded that of Huggins, has, I believe, gone through nearly twenty editions.</p>
			<p>This last circumstance may, however, be cited, rather as a proof of the new passion entertained for Italian literature, than as an illustration of the progress which had been made in it: for never was a worse or more faithless translation executed than that of Hoole. Every grace, every shade, every gradation of colouring which distinguishes Ariosto, is lost in it. Thus, where the Italian poet, in imitation of Homer, wishing to diversify a scene of slaughter, by giving something of character or of locality to his victims, tells us that Rodomont wounded Lewis the Provençal, <i xml:lang="it">Luigi il provenzal</i>, Hoole has absurdly translated the passage “<em>Provincial Lewis!</em>” thus awakening a most ridiculous train of ideas, and suggesting the notion of some unfortunate provincial who had the misfortune to have his brains knocked out on his visit to the metropolis. Nor are they only tints and shades which are sacrificed in this miserable copy; for the sense of the author, where most obvious, is frequently misinterpreted; and in one couplet the translator has actually mistaken <em>north</em> for south, and <em>sun</em> for wind; the one specified, and the other obviously implied. The words of the original are,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem" xml:lang="it">
				<p>
					<span>“Wer ponente io andava lungo la sabbia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Che del <em>settentrion</em> sente la rabbia.”</span>
				</p>
				<cite>Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXIV</span></cite>
			</blockquote>
			<p class="continued">Which passage is thus rendered by him:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>Against the west along those sands we came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which feel the <em>southern heat of Phoebus’ flame</em>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a></span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>In addition, however, to the mistakes of Hoole, and what I must call the meanness and monotony of his poetry, I am inclined to consider the metre which he has chosen, as one among the many causes of his failure: this is our heroic couplet, which appears to me to be the measure most opposite to that of Ariosto which could possibly have been selected. Nothing but a stanza can reflect the original; for it is to be observed, that the poet usually closes the idea with it, and that the end of most of them is marked by something epigrammatic either in sense or sound, which would be out of its place except in the concluding couplet. Each canto, or collection of stanzas, then, may be compared to a gallery of cabinet pictures, all perhaps striking or beautiful, but frequently executed on different principles, each of which is often only in harmony with itself. Whoever, therefore, unites any of these little paintings, yet more, he who runs them into one piece, will necessarily either present a picture full of cross lights, and every species of inconsistency, or will only avoid this by leaving out whatever is most characteristic in the original, and by making a smear without light, shade, or distinction of outline.</p>
			<p>Entertaining this opinion, I have chosen the stanza in preference to the couplet; and because I would imitate Ariosto as closely as the nature of our language will allow, have, like Harrington and Huggins, chosen his own ottava rima as the most preferable form of it. Like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Huggins, I have also translated stanza for stanza, but have not, however, imitated that gentleman and some German translators by imposing on myself severer restrictions than appeared to me, to be necessary; as in rendering him uniformly line for line; the less so because there is little analogy between the construction of the two languages, and what is easy in the Italian (I need not say that ease is one characteristic of Ariosto) might often appear harsh and inverted in English. It is for this reason that I have not fettered myself by the rule I have mentioned, wherever I conceived any bad effect would result from the adherence to it; but I have, on the other hand, observed it where I thought such a compliance was not objectionable; because I would, wherever it was practicable, tread in the very footsteps of the Italian poet.</p>
			<p>My reasons for so religious, some may think so superstitious, an observance of my author’s text, have, at least, not been hastily adopted. A long consideration of the means through which he wrought, has convinced me that many strong or beautiful effects produced by him, result out of an accumulation of circumstances, which, though they may appear of little value taken separately, are to be esteemed important as conducing, each in its place, to the main object of the poet. In this particularity he bears a striking resemblance to Defoe. The Furioso moreover, often pleases as a whole, where it offends in parts, and, notwithstanding many defects, is perhaps the poetical work which is oftenest re-perused with pleasure. Among the many things which have probably contributed to this, may be remarked Ariosto’s frequent sacrifice of force to truth; which (to take a short instance) I should say was illustrated by Pinabel’s narration of the loss of his lady, in the second canto, where some may be inclined to think that the poet overtalks himself, and many might wish to see the infusion of a spirit, which would perhaps be out of harmony with the circumstances. He is often also studious of what the artists call a repose, and upon which a translator should be most cautious never to intrude. These are some of the reasons why I have followed my leader so warily, and have never intentionally deviated from the print of his steps.</p>
			<p>I am, however, well aware that a very weighty objection may be made to a translation so close as that which I present to the reader. It may be said that a simplicity of diction, which is leasing in the Italian, is only to be endured in a less perfect perfect, when seasoned by the addition of some grace, congenial with the spirit of that into which it is transfused: and hence that to translate the Furioso faithfully into English, would be, to borrow a metaphor used somewhere by Alfieri, to transfer an air from the harp to the hurdy-gurdy.</p>
			<p>There is, undoubtedly, great force in this reasoning and illustration. To this, however, I will oppose, in the way of question, <em>another</em> illustration which is drawn from a sister art. Would a real lover of Raphael prefer a copy of one of his pictures, which, though well painted, did not convey a true idea of his colouring, or a print of it carefully executed, which gave, at least, a faithful idea of the design? To those who would choose the engraving I offer the following translation.</p>
			<p>That it <em>is</em> diligently executed, I may venture to assert; for, mistrusting a hasty mode of reading and a facility of composition, I have sought to guard against the faults incidental to these habits, by frequent and attentive correction. I have with this view, submitted every sheet of my present translation to judicious English and Italian friends; have carefully, if not impartially, weighed their objections, and revised my translation more than once by a close comparison with the original.</p>
