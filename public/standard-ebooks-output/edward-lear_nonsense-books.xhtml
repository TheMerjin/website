			<p>The following lines by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear were written for a young lady of his acquaintance, who had quoted to him the words of a young lady not of his acquaintance, “How pleasant to know <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear!”</p>

					<span>Long ago he was one of the singers,</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Introduction</h2>
			<p>Edward Lear, the artist, author of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Journals of a Landscape Painter</i> in various out-of-the-way countries, and of the delightful <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Books of Nonsense</i>, which have amused successive generations of children, died on Sunday, January 29, 1888, at San Remo, Italy, where he had lived for twenty years. Few names could evoke a wider expression of passing regret at their appearance in the obituary column; for until his health began to fail he was known to an immense and almost a cosmopolitan circle of acquaintance, and popular wherever he was known. Fewer still could call up in the minds of intimate friends a deeper and more enduring feeling of sorrow for personal loss, mingled with the pleasantest of memories; for it was impossible to know him thoroughly and not to love him. London, Rome, the Mediterranean countries generally, Ceylon and India, are still all dotted with survivors among his generation who will mourn for him affectionately, although his latter years were spent in comparatively close retirement. He was a man of striking nobility of nature, fearless, independent, energetic, given to forming for himself strong opinions, often hastily, sometimes bitterly; not always strong or sound in judgment, but always seeking after truth in every matter, and following it as he understood it in scorn of consequence; utterly unselfish, devoted to his friends, generous even to extravagance towards anyone who had ever been connected with his fortunes or his travels; playful, lighthearted, witty, and humorous, but not without those occasional fits of black depression and nervous irritability to which such temperaments are liable.</p>
			<p>Great and varied as the merits of his pictures are, Lear hardly succeeded in achieving any great popularity as a landscape-painter. His work was frequently done on private commission, and he rarely sent in pictures for the Academy or other exhibitions. His larger and more highly finished landscapes were unequal in technical perfection⁠—sometimes harsh or cold in color, or stiff in composition; sometimes full of imagination, at others literal and prosaic⁠—but always impressive reproductions of interesting or peculiar scenery. In later years he used in conversation to qualify himself as a “topographical artist;” and the definition was true, though not exhaustive. He had an intuitive and a perfectly trained eye for the character and beauty of distant mountain lines, the solemnity of rocky gorges, the majesty of a single mountain rising from a base of plain or sea; and he was equally exact in rendering the true forms of the middle distances and the specialties of foreground detail belonging to the various lands through which he had wandered as a sketcher. Some of his pictures show a mastery which has rarely been equalled over the difficulties of painting an immense plain as seen from a height, reaching straight away from the eye of the spectator until it is lost in a dim horizon. Sir Roderick Murchison used to say that he always understood the geological peculiarities of a country he had only studied in Lear’s sketches. The compliment was thoroughly justified; and it is not every landscape-painter to whom it could honestly be paid.</p>
			<p>The history of Lear’s choice of a career was a curious one. He was the youngest of twenty-one children, and, through a family mischance, was thrown entirely on the limited resources of an elderly sister at a very early age. As a boy he had always dabbled in colors for his own amusement, and had been given to poring over the ordinary boys’ books upon natural history. It occurred to him to try to turn his infant talents to account; and he painted upon cardboard a couple of birds in the style which the older among us remember as having been called Oriental tinting, took them to a small shop, and sold them for fourpence. The kindness of friends, to whom he was ever grateful, gave him the opportunity of more serious and more remunerative study, and he became a patient and accurate zoölogical draughtsman. Many of the birds in the earlier volumes of Gould’s magnificent folios were drawn for him by Lear. A few years back there were eagles alive in the Zoölogical Gardens in Regent’s Park to which Lear could point as old familiar friends that he had drawn laboriously from claw to beak fifty years before. He united with this kind of work the more unpleasant occupation of drawing the curiosities of disease or deformity in hospitals. One day, as he was busily intent on the portrait of a bird in the Zoölogical Gardens, an old gentleman came and looked over his shoulder, entered into conversation, and finally said to him, “You must come and draw my birds at Knowsley.” Lear did not know where Knowsley was, or what it meant; but the old gentleman was the thirteenth Earl of Derby. The successive Earls of Derby have been among Lear’s kindest and most generous patrons. He went to Knowsley, and the drawings in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Knowsley Menagerie</i> (now a rare and highly-prized work among book collectors) are by Lear’s hand. At Knowsley he became a permanent favorite; and it was there that he composed in prolific succession his charming and wonderful series of utterly nonsensical rhymes and drawings. Lear had already begun seriously to study landscape. When English winters began to threaten his health, Lord Derby started a subscription which enabled him to go to Rome as a student and artist, and no doubt gave him recommendations among Anglo-Roman society which laid the foundations of a numerous clientele. It was in the Roman summers that Lear first began to exercise the taste for pictorial wandering which grew into a habit and a passion, to fill vivid and copious notebooks as he went, and to illustrate them by spirited and accurate drawings; and his first volume of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Illustrated Excursions in Italy</i>, published in 1846, is gratefully dedicated to his Knowsley patron.</p>
			<p>Only those who have travelled with him could know what a delightful comrade he was to men whose tastes ran more or less parallel to his own. It was not everybody who could travel with him; for he was so irrepressibly anxious not to lose a moment of the time at his disposal for gathering into his garners the beauty and interest of the lands over which he journeyed, that he was careless of comfort and health. Calabria, Sicily, the Desert of Sinai, Egypt and Nubia, Greece and Albania, Palestine, Syria, Athos, Candia, Montenegro, Zagóri (who knows now where Zagóri is, or was?), were as thoroughly explored and sketched by him as the more civilized localities of Malta, Corsica, and Corfu. He read insatiably before starting all the recognized guidebooks and histories of the country he intended to draw; and his published itineraries are marked by great strength and literary interest quite irrespectively of the illustrations. And he had his reward. It is not any ordinary journalist and sketcher who could have compelled from Tennyson such a tribute as lines “To <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">E. L.</abbr> on his Travels in Greece”:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“Illyrian woodlands, echoing falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of water, sheets of summer glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The long divine Peneïan pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vast Akrokeraunian walls,</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Tomohrit, Athos, all things fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such a pencil, such a pen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You shadow forth to distant men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I read and felt that I was there.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Lear was a man to whom, as to Tennyson’s Ulysses,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“All experience is an arch wherethrough</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gleams that untravelled world.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>After settling at San Remo, and when he was nearly sixty years old, he determined to visit India and Ceylon. He started once and failed, being taken so ill at Suez that he was obliged to return. The next year he succeeded, and brought away some thousands of drawings of the most striking views from all three Presidencies and from the tropical island. His appetite for travel continued to grow with what it fed upon; and although he hated a long sea-voyage, he used seriously to contemplate as possible a visit to relations in New Zealand. It may safely, however, be averred that no considerations would have tempted him to visit the Arctic regions.</p>
			<p>A hardworking life, checkered by the odd adventures which happen to the odd and the adventurous and pass over the commonplace; a career brightened by the high appreciation of unimpeachable critics; lightened, till of late, by the pleasant society and good wishes of innumerable friends; saddened by the growing pressure of ill health and solitude; cheered by his constant trust in the love and sympathy of those who knew him best, however far away⁠—such was the life of Edward Lear.⁠—<i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The London Saturday Review</i>, <abbr>Feb.</abbr> 4, 1888.</p>
			<p>Among the writers who have striven with varying success during the last thirty or forty years to awaken the merriment of the “rising generation” of the time being, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Edward Lear occupies the first place in seniority, if not in merit. The parent of modern nonsense-writers, he is distinguished from all his followers and imitators by the superior consistency with which he has adhered to his aim⁠—that of amusing his readers by fantastic absurdities, as void of vulgarity or cynicism as they are incapable of being made to harbor any symbolical meaning. He “never deviates into sense;” but those who appreciate him never feel the need of such deviation. He has a genius for coining absurd names and words, which, even when they are suggested by the exigencies of his metre, have a ludicrous appropriateness to the matter in hand. His verse is, with the exception of a certain number of cockney rhymes, wonderfully flowing and even melodious⁠—or, as he would say, <em>meloobious</em>⁠—while to all these qualifications for his task must finally be added the happy gift of pictorial expression, enabling him to double, nay, often to quadruple, the laughable effect of his text by an inexhaustible profusion of the quaintest designs. Generally speaking, these designs are, as it were, an idealization of the efforts of a clever child; but now and then⁠—as in the case of the nonsense-botany⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear reminds us what a genuine and graceful artist he really is. The advantage to a humorist of being able to illustrate his own text has been shown in the case of Thackeray and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> W. S. Gilbert, to mention two familiar examples; but in no other instance of such a combination have we discovered such geniality as is to be found in the nonsense-pictures of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear. We have spoken above of the melodiousness of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s verses, a quality which renders them excellently suitable for musical setting, and which has not escaped the notice of the author himself. We have also heard effective arrangements, presumably by other composers, of the adventures of the Table and the Chair, and of the cruise of the Owl and the Pussycat⁠—the latter introduced into the “drawing-room entertainment” of one of the followers of John Parry. Indeed, in these days of adaptations, it is to be wondered at that no enterprising librettist has attempted to build a children’s comic opera out of the materials supplied in the four books with which we are now concerned. The first of these, originally published in 1846, and brought out in an enlarged form in 1863, is exclusively devoted to nonsense-verses of one type. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear is careful to disclaim the credit of having created this type, for he tells us in the preface to his third book that “the lines beginning, ‘There was an old man of Tobago,’ were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse leading itself to limitless variety for Rhymes and Pictures.” Dismissing the further question of the authorship of “There was an old man of Tobago,” we propose to give a few specimens of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s Protean powers as exhibited in the variation of this simple type. Here, to begin with, is a favorite verse, which we are very glad to have an opportunity of giving, as it is often incorrectly quoted, “cocks” being substituted for “owls” in the third line:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“There was an Old Man with a beard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who said, ‘It is just as I feared!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two Owls and a Hen, four Larks and a Wren,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have all built their nests in my beard!’ ”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>With the kindly fatalism which is the distinctive note of the foregoing stanza, the sentiment of our next extract is in vivid contrast:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“There was an Old Man in a tree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was terribly bored by a bee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they said, ‘Does it buzz?’ he replied, ‘Yes, it does!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s a regular brute of a Bee.’ ”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>To the foregoing verse an historic interest attaches, if, that is, we are right in supposing it to have inspired <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert with his famous “Nonsense-Rhyme in Blank Verse.” We quote from memory:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“There was an Old Man of <abbr>St.</abbr> Bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was stung in the arm by a wasp.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they asked, ‘Does it hurt?’ he replied, ‘No, it doesn’t,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I thought all the while ’twas a Hornet!’ ”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Passing over the lines referring to the “Young Person” of Crete to whom the epithet “ombliferous” is applied, we may be pardoned⁠—on the ground of the geographical proximity of the two countries named⁠—for quoting together two stanzas which in reality are separated by a good many pages:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“There was a Young Lady of Norway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who casually sat in a doorway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the doors queezed her flat, she exclaimed, ‘What of that?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This courageous young person of Norway.”</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“There was a Young Lady of Sweden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who went by the slow train to Weedon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they cried, ‘Weedon Station!’ she made no observation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thought she should go back to Sweden.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A noticeable feature about this first book, and one which we think is peculiar to it, is the harsh treatment which the eccentricities of the inhabitants of certain towns appear to have met with at the hands of their fellow-residents. No less than three people are “smashed,”⁠—the Old Man of Whitehaven “who danced a quadrille with a Raven;” the Old Person of Buda; and the Old Man with a gong “who bumped at it all the day long,” though in the last-named case we admit that there was considerable provocation. Before quitting the first “Nonsense-Book,” we would point out that it contains one or two forms that are interesting; for instance, “scroobious,” which we take to be a Portmanteau word, and “spickle-speckled,” a favorite form of reduplication with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear, and of which the best specimen occurs in his last book, “He tinkledy-binkledy-winkled the bell.” The second book, published in 1871, shows <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear in the maturity of sweet desipience, and will perhaps remain the favorite volume of the four to grownup readers. The nonsense-songs are all good, and “The Story of the Four little Children who went Round the World” is the most exquisite piece of imaginative absurdity that the present writer is acquainted with. But before coming to that, let us quote a few lines from “The Jumblies,” who, as all the world knows, went to sea in a sieve:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span class="i1">“They sailed to the Western Sea, they did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To a land all covered with trees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they bought an Owl, and a useful Cart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a pound of Rice, and a Cranberry Tart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a hive of silvery Bees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And they bought a Pig, and some green Jackdaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a lovely Monkey with lollipop paws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And forty bottles of Ring-Bo-Ree,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And no end of Stilton Cheese.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">
						<em>Far and few, far and few,</em>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">
						<em>Are the lands where the Jumblies live.</em>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i2">
						<em>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</em>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i3">
						<em>And they went to sea in a sieve.</em>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in twenty years they all came back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In twenty years or more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And everyone said, ‘How tall they’ve grown!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For they’ve been to the Lakes, and the Torrible Zone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the hills of the Chankly Bore.’ ”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>From the pedestrian excursion of the “Table and the Chair,” we cannot resist making a brief quotation, though in this, as in every case, the inability to quote the drawings also is a sad drawback:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“So they both went slowly down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And walked about the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With a cheerful bumpy sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they toddled round and round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And everybody cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they hastened to their side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘See, the Table and the Chair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have come out to take the air!’</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“But in going down an alley</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To a castle in a valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They completely lost their way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wandered all the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till, to see them safely back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They paid a Ducky-Quack,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a Beetle and a Mouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who took them to their house.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>“Then they whispered to each other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O delightful little brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What a lovely walk we’ve taken!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So the Ducky and the leetle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Browny-Mousy, and the Beetle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dined, and danced upon their heads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till they toddled to their beds.”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>“The Story of the Four little Children who went Round the World” follows next, and the account of the manner in which they occupied themselves while on shipboard may be transcribed for the benefit of those unfortunate persons who have not perused the original: “During the daytime Violet chiefly occupied herself in putting saltwater into a churn, while her three brothers churned it violently in the hope it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did.” After journeying for a time, they saw some land at a distance, “and when they came to it they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses with a great Gulf-Stream running about all over it, so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, five hundred and three feet high.” In a later passage, we read how “by-and-by the children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. Each of these blue bottles contained a bluebottlefly, and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony, nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found.” Our last quotation from this inimitable recital shall be from the description of their adventure on a great plain where they espied an object which “on a nearer approach and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig sitting on an armchair made of sponge-cake and oyster-shells.” This turned out to be the “Cooperative Cauliflower,” who, “while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust⁠ ⁠… suddenly arose, and in a somewhat plumdomphious manner hurried off towards the setting sun, his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential cucumbers⁠ ⁠… till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand. So remarkable a sight of course impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.”</p>
			<p>In his third book, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear takes occasion in an entertaining preface to repudiate the charge of harboring any ulterior motive beyond that of “Nonsense pure and absolute” in any of his verses or pictures, and tells a delightful anecdote illustrative of the “persistently absurd report” that the Earl of Derby was the author of the first book of “Nonsense.” In this volume he reverts once more to the familiar form adopted in his original efforts, and with little falling off. It is to be remarked that the third division is styled “Twenty-Six Nonsense Rhymes and Pictures,” although there is no more rhyme than reason in any of the set. Our favorite illustrations are those of the “Scroobious Snake who always wore a Hat on his Head, for fear he should bite anybody,” and the “Visibly Vicious Vulture who wrote some Verses to a Veal-cutlet in a Volume bound in Vellum.” In the fourth and last of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s books, we meet not only with familiar words, but personages and places⁠—old friends like the Jumblies, the Yonghy-Bonghy-Bò, the Quangle Wangle, the hills of the Chankly Bore, and the great Gromboolian plain, as well as new creations, such as the Dong with a luminous Nose, whose story is a sort of nonsense version of the love of Nausicaa for Ulysses, only that the sexes are inverted. In these verses, graceful fancy is so subtly interwoven with nonsense as almost to beguile us into feeling a real interest in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s absurd creations. So again in the “Pelican Chorus” there are some charming lines:⁠—</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>“By day we fish, and at eve we stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On long bare islands of yellow sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the sun sinks slowly down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the great rock-walls grow dark and brown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the purple river rolls fast and dim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the ivory Ibis starlike skim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wing to wing we dance around,” <abbr>etc.</abbr></span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>The other nonsense-poems are all good, but we have no space for further quotation, and will take leave of our subject by propounding the following set of examination questions which a friend who is deeply versed in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s books has drawn up for us:⁠—</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p>What do you gather from a study of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s works to have been the prevalent characteristics of the inhabitants of Gretna, Prague, Thermopylae, Wick, and Hong Kong?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>State briefly what historical events are connected with Ischia, Chertsey, Whitehaven, Boulak, and Jellibolee.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Comment, with illustrations, upon <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s use of the following words: Runcible, propitious, dolomphious, borascible, fizzgiggious, himmeltanious, tumble-dum-down, spongetaneous.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Enumerate accurately all the animals who lived on the Quangle Wangle’s Hat, and explain how the Quangle Wangle was enabled at once to enlighten his five travelling companions as to the true nature of the Cooperative Cauliflower.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>What were the names of the five daughters of the Old Person of China, and what was the purpose for which the Old Man of the Dargle purchased six barrels of Gargle?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Collect notices of King Xerxes in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s works, and state your theory, if you have any, as to the character and appearance of Nupiter Piffkin.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Draw pictures of the Plum-pudding flea, and the Moppsikon Floppsikon Bear, and state by whom waterproof tubs were first used.</p>
				</li>
				<li epub:type="z3998:poem">
					<p>
						<span>“There was an old man at a station</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who made a promiscuous oration.”</span>
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>What bearing may we assume the foregoing couplet to have upon <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear’s political views?</p>

					<h4 epub:type="title">The Dong with a Luminous Nose</h4>
					<p>
						<span>When awful darkness and silence reign</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over the great Gromboolian plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Through the long, long wintry nights;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the angry breakers roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As they beat on the rocky shore;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">When Storm-clouds brood on the towering heights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the Hills of the Chankly Bore⁠—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then, through the vast and gloomy dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There moves what seems a fiery spark⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">A lonely spark with silvery rays</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Piercing the coal-black night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">A Meteor strange and bright:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Hither and thither the vision strays,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">A single lurid light.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Slowly it wanders, pauses, creeps⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon it sparkles, flashes, and leaps;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever as onward it gleaming goes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A light on the Bong-tree stems it throws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those who watch at that midnight hour</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cry, as the wild light passes along⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">“The Dong! the Dong!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The wandering Dong through the forest goes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The Dong! the Dong!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The Dong with a luminous Nose!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i2">Long years ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The Dong was happy and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till he fell in love with a Jumbly Girl</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Who came to those shores one day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the Jumblies came in a sieve, they did⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Landing at eve near the Zemmery Fidd</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Where the Oblong Oysters grow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And the rocks are smooth and gray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the woods and the valleys rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the Chorus they daily and nightly sang⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">
							<em>“Far and few, far and few,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">
							<em>Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">
							<em>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">
							<em>And they went to sea in a sieve.”</em>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Happily, happily passed those days!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">While the cheerful Jumblies staid;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">They danced in circlets all night long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">To the plaintive pipe of the lively Dong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i4">In moonlight, shine, or shade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For day and night he was always there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By the side of the Jumbly Girl so fair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With her sky-blue hands and her sea-green hair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till the morning came of that hateful day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When the Jumblies sailed in their sieve away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the Dong was left on the cruel shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazing, gazing for evermore⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ever keeping his weary eyes on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That pea-green sail on the far horizon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Singing the Jumbly Chorus still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he sat all day on the grassy hill⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i5">
							<em>“Far and few, far and few,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i5">
							<em>Are the lands where the Jumblies live;</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i5">
							<em>Their heads are green, and their hands are blue,</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i5">
							<em>And they went to sea in a sieve.”</em>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when the sun was low in the West,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">The Dong arose and said⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“What little sense I once possessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Has quite gone out of my head!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And since that day he wanders still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By lake and forest, marsh and hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Singing, “O somewhere, in valley or plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might I find my Jumbly Girl again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forever I’ll seek by lake and shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till I find my Jumbly Girl once more!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">Playing a pipe with silvery squeaks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Since then his Jumbly Girl he seeks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And because by night he could not see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">He gathered the bark of the Twangum Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">On the flowery plain that grows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">And he wove him a wondrous Nose⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">A Nose as strange as a Nose could be!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of vast proportions and painted red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tied with cords to the back of his head.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In a hollow rounded space it ended</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">With a luminous Lamp within suspended,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">All fenced about</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">With a bandage stout</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">To prevent the wind from blowing it out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And with holes all round to send the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">In gleaming rays on the dismal night</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now each night, and all night long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over those plains still roams the Dong;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And above the wail of the Chimp and Snipe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You may hear the squeak of his plaintive pipe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While ever he seeks, but seeks in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet with his Jumbly Girl again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lonely and wild, all night he goes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Dong with a luminous Nose!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all who watch at the midnight hour,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Hall or Terrace or lofty Tower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cry, as they trace the Meteor bright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moving along through the dreary night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">“This is the hour when forth he goes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The Dong with a luminous Nose!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Yonder, over the plain he goes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">He goes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">He goes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">The Dong with a luminous Nose!”</span>

						<span>But to lose our teeth and eyelashes and keep on growing thinner?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Said he who caught the Mouse to him who caught the Muffin⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“We might cook this little Mouse, if we only had some Stuffin’!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If we had but Sage and Onion we could do extremely well;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But how to get that Stuffin’ it is difficult to tell!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Those two old Bachelors ran quickly to the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And asked for Sage and Onion as they wandered up and down;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They borrowed two large Onions, but no Sage was to be found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the Shops, or in the Market, or in all the Gardens round.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But someone said, “A hill there is, a little to the north,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to its purpledicular top a narrow way leads forth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there among the rugged rocks abides an ancient Sage⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An earnest Man, who reads all day a most perplexing page.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Climb up, and seize him by the toes⁠—all studious as he sits⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pull him down, and chop him into endless little bits!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then mix him with your Onion (cut up likewise into Scraps)⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When your Stuffin’ will be ready, and very good⁠—perhaps.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Those two old Bachelors without loss of time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nearly purpledicular crags at once began to climb;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And at the top, among the rocks, all seated in a nook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw that Sage a-reading of a most enormous book.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“You earnest Sage!” aloud they cried, “your book you’ve read enough in!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We wish to chop you into bits to mix you into Stuffin’!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But that old Sage looked calmly up, and with his awful book,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At those two Bachelors’ bald heads a certain aim he took;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over Crag and precipice they rolled promiscuous down⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At once they rolled, and never stopped in lane or field or town;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they reached their house, they found (besides their want of Stuffin’),</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Mouse had fled⁠—and, previously, had eaten up the Muffin.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They left their home in silence by the once convivial door;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from that hour those Bachelors were never heard of more.</span>

						<span>We live on the Nile. The Nile we love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By night we sleep on the cliffs above;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By day we fish, and at eve we stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On long bare islands of yellow sand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the sun sinks slowly down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the great rock walls grow dark and brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where the purple river rolls fast and dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the Ivory Ibis starlike skim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wing to wing we dance around,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stamping our feet with a flumpy sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Opening our mouths as Pelicans ought;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this is the song we nightly snort⁠—</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Last year came out our Daughter Dell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the Birds received her well.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do her honor a feast we made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For every bird that can swim or wade⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Herons and Gulls, and Cormorants black,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cranes, and Flamingoes with scarlet back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plovers and Storks, and Geese in clouds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swans and Dilberry Ducks in crowds:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thousands of Birds in wondrous flight!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They ate and drank and danced all night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And echoing back from the rocks you heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Multitude-echoes from Bird and Bird⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think no Birds so happy as we!</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yes, they came; and among the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The King of the Cranes all grandly dressed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such a lovely tail! Its feathers float</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the ends of his blue dress-coat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With pea-green trousers all so neat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a delicate frill to hide his feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(For though no one speaks of it, everyone knows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He has got no webs between his toes).</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As soon as he saw our Daughter Dell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In violent love that Crane King fell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On seeing her waddling form so fair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a wreath of shrimps in her short white hair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And before the end of the next long day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our Dell had given her heart away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For the King of the Cranes had won that heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With a Crocodile’s egg and a large fish-tart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She vowed to marry the King of the Cranes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leaving the Nile for stranger plains;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And away they flew in a gathering crowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of endless birds in a lengthening cloud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i2">Ploffskin, Pluffskin, Pelican jee!</span>

						<br/>
						<span class="i2">We think so then, and we thought so still!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And far away in the twilight sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We heard them singing a lessening cry⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Farther and farther, till out of sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we stood alone in the silent night!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Often since, in the nights of June,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We sit on the sand and watch the moon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She has gone to the great Gromboolian Plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we probably never shall meet again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oft, in the long still nights of June,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We sit on the rocks and watch the moon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She dwells by the streams of the Chankly Bore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we probably never shall see her more.</span>

					<h4 epub:type="title">The New Vestments</h4>
					<p>
						<span>There lived an old man in the Kingdom of Tess,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who invented a purely original dress;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when it was perfectly made and complete,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He opened the door and walked into the street.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>By way of a hat he’d a loaf of Brown Bread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the middle of which he inserted his head;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Shirt was made up of no end of dead Mice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The warmth of whose skins was quite fluffy and nice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Drawers were of Rabbit-skins, so were his Shoes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Stockings were skins, but it is not known whose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Waistcoat and Trousers were made of Pork Chops;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Buttons were Jujubes and Chocolate Drops;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Coat was all Pancakes, with Jam for a border,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And a girdle of Biscuits to keep it in order;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he wore over all, as a screen from bad weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Cloak of green Cabbage-leaves stitched all together.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He had walked a short way, when he heard a great noise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all sorts of Beasticles, Birdlings, and Boys;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from every long street and dark lane in the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beasts, Birdies, and Boys in a tumult rushed down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two Cows and a Calf ate his Cabbage-leaf Cloak;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Four Apes seized his Girdle, which vanished like smoke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three Kids ate up half of his Pancaky Coat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the tails were devour’d by an ancient He Goat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An army of Dogs in a twinkling tore <em>up</em> his</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pork Waistcoat and Trousers to give to their Puppies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while they were growling, and mumbling the Chops,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten Boys prigged the Jujubes and Chocolate Drops.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He tried to run back to his house, but in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For scores of fat Pigs came again and again:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They rushed out of stables and hovels and doors;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They tore off his stockings, his shoes, and his drawers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now from the housetops with screechings descend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Striped, spotted, white, black, and gray Cats without end:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They jumped on his shoulders and knocked off his hat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Crows, Ducks, and Hens made a mincemeat of that;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They speedily flew at his sleeves in a trice,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And utterly tore up his Shirt of dead Mice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They swallowed the last of his Shirt with a squall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereon he ran home with no clothes on at all.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And he said to himself, as he bolted the door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I will not wear a similar dress any more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Any more, any more, any more, never more!”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Introduction</h3>
				<p>In offering this little book⁠—the third of its kind⁠—to the public, I am glad to take the opportunity of recording the pleasure I have received at the appreciation its predecessors have met with, as attested by their wide circulation, and by the universally kind notices of them from the Press. To have been the means of administering innocent mirth to thousands, may surely be a just motive for satisfaction, and an excuse for grateful expression.</p>
				<p>At the same time, I am desirous of adding a few words as to the history of the two previously published volumes, and more particularly of the first or original <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Book of Nonsense</i>, relating to which many absurd reports have crept into circulation, such as that it was the composition of the late Lord Brougham, the late Earl of Derby, <abbr>etc.</abbr>; that the rhymes and pictures are by different persons; or that the whole have a symbolical meaning, <abbr>etc.</abbr>; whereas, every one of the rhymes was composed by myself, and every one of the illustrations drawn by my own hand at the time the verses were made. Moreover, in no portion of these Nonsense drawings have I ever allowed any caricature of private or public persons to appear, and throughout, more care than might be supposed has been given to make the subjects incapable of misinterpretation: “Nonsense,” pure and absolute, having been my aim throughout.</p>
				<p>As for the persistently absurd report of the late Earl of Derby being the author of the first <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Book of Nonsense</i>, I may relate an incident which occurred to me four summers ago, the first that gave me any insight into the origin of the rumor.</p>
				<p>I was on my way from London to Guildford, in a railway carriage, containing, besides myself, one passenger, an elderly gentleman: presently, however, two ladies entered, accompanied by two little boys. These, who had just had a copy of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Book of Nonsense</i> given them, were loud in their delight, and by degrees infected the whole party with their mirth.</p>
				<p>“How grateful,” said the old gentleman to the two ladies, “all children, and parents too, ought to be to the statesman who has given his time to composing that charming book!”</p>
				<p>(The ladies looked puzzled, as indeed was I, the author.)</p>
				<p>“Do you not know who is the writer of it?” asked the gentleman.</p>
				<p>“The name is ‘Edward Lear,’ ” said one of the ladies.</p>
				<p>“Ah!” said the first speaker, “so it is printed; but that is only a whim of the real author, the Earl of Derby. ‘Edward’ is his Christian name, and, as you may see, <em>Lear</em> is only <em>Earl</em> transposed.”</p>
				<p>“But,” said the lady, doubtingly, “here is a dedication to the great-grandchildren, grandnephews, and grandnieces of Edward, thirteenth Earl of Derby, by the author, Edward Lear.”</p>
				<p>“That,” replied the other, “is simply a piece of mystification; I am in a position to know that the whole book was composed and illustrated by Lord Derby himself. In fact, there is no such a person at all as Edward Lear.”</p>
				<p>“Yet,” said the other lady, “some friends of mine tell me they know <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lear.”</p>
				<p>“Quite a mistake! completely a mistake!” said the old gentleman, becoming rather angry at the contradiction; “I am well aware of what I am saying: I can inform you, no such a person as ‘Edward Lear’ exists!”</p>
				<p>Hitherto I had kept silence; but as my hat was, as well as my handkerchief and stick, largely marked inside with my name, and as I happened to have in my pocket several letters addressed to me, the temptation was too great to resist; so, flashing all these articles at once on my would-be extinguisher’s attention, I speedily reduced him to silence.</p>
				<p>The second volume of Nonsense, commencing with the verses, “The Owl and the Pussycat,” was written at different times, and for different sets of children: the whole being collected in the course of last year, were then illustrated, and published in a single volume, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R. J.</abbr> Bush, of 32 Charing Cross.</p>
				<p>The contents of the third or present volume were made also at different intervals in the last two years.</p>
				<p>Long years ago, in days when much of my time was passed in a country house, where children and mirth abounded, the lines beginning, “There was an old man of Tobago,” were suggested to me by a valued friend, as a form of verse lending itself to limitless variety for rhymes and pictures; and thenceforth the greater part of the original drawings and verses for the first <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Book of Nonsense</i> were struck off with a pen, no assistance ever having been given me in any way but that of uproarious delight and welcome at the appearance of every new absurdity.</p>
				<p>Most of these drawings and rhymes were transferred to lithographic stones in the year 1846, and were then first published by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thomas McLean, of the Haymarket. But that edition having been soon exhausted, and the call for the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Book of Nonsense</i> continuing, I added a considerable number of subjects to those previously-published, and having caused the whole to be carefully reproduced in woodcuts by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Dalzell, I disposed of the copyright to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Messrs.</abbr> Routledge and Warne, by whom the volume was published in 1843.</p>

					<p class="continued">and they all thought they should like to see the world. So they bought a large boat to sail quite round the world by sea, and then they were to come back on the other side by land. The boat was painted blue with green spots, and the sail was yellow with red stripes: and, when they set off, they only took a small Cat to steer and look after the boat, besides an elderly Quangle-Wangle, who had to cook the dinner and make the tea; for which purposes they took a large kettle.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>For the first ten days they sailed on beautifully, and found plenty to eat, as there were lots of fish; and they had only to take them out of the sea with a long spoon, when the Quangle-Wangle instantly cooked them; and the Pussycat was fed with the bones, with which she expressed herself pleased, on the whole: so that all the party were very happy.</p>

					<p>During the daytime, Violet chiefly occupied herself in putting salt water into a churn; while her three brothers churned it violently, in the hope that it would turn into butter, which it seldom if ever did; and in the evening they all retired into the teakettle, where they all managed to sleep very comfortably, while Pussy and the Quangle-Wangle managed the boat.</p>

					<p>After a time, they saw some land at a distance; and, when they came to it, they found it was an island made of water quite surrounded by earth. Besides that, it was bordered by evanescent isthmuses, with a great gulf-stream running about all over it; so that it was perfectly beautiful, and contained only a single tree, 503 feet high.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>When they had landed, they walked about, but found, to their great surprise, that the island was quite full of veal-cutlets and chocolate-drops, and nothing else. So they all climbed up the single high tree to discover, if possible, if there were any people; but having remained on the top of the tree for a week, and not seeing anybody, they naturally concluded that there were no inhabitants; and accordingly, when they came down, they loaded the boat with two thousand veal-cutlets and a million of chocolate-drops; and these afforded them sustenance for more than a month, during which time they pursued their voyage with the utmost delight and apathy.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>After this they came to a shore where there were no less than sixty-five great red parrots with blue tails, sitting on a rail all of a row, and all fast asleep. And I am sorry to say that the Pussycat and the Quangle-Wangle crept softly, and bit off the tail-feathers of all the sixty-five parrots; for which Violet reproved them both severely.</p>
					<p>Notwithstanding which, she proceeded to insert all the feathers⁠—two hundred and sixty in number⁠—in her bonnet; thereby causing it to have a lovely and glittering appearance, highly prepossessing and efficacious.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>The next thing that happened to them was in a narrow part of the sea, which was so entirely full of fishes that the boat could go on no farther: so they remained there about six weeks, till they had eaten nearly all the fishes, which were soles, and all ready-cooked, and covered with shrimp-sauce, so that there was no trouble whatever.</p>
					<p>And as the few fishes who remained uneaten complained of the cold, as well as of the difficulty they had in getting any sleep on account of the extreme noise made by the arctic bears and the tropical turnspits, which frequented the neighborhood in great numbers, Violet most amiably knitted a small woollen frock for several of the fishes, and Slingsby administered some opium-drops to them; through which kindness they became quite warm, and slept soundly.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>Then they came to a country which was wholly covered with immense orange-trees of a vast size, and quite full of fruit. So they all landed, taking with them the teakettle, intending to gather some of the oranges, and place them in it. But, while they were busy about this, a most dreadfully high wind rose, and blew out most of the parrot-tail feathers from Violet’s bonnet. That, however, was nothing compared with the calamity of the oranges falling down on their heads by millions and millions, which thumped and bumped and bumped and thumped them all so seriously, that they were obliged to run as hard as they could for their lives; besides that the sound of the oranges rattling on the teakettle was of the most fearful and amazing nature.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>Nevertheless, they got safely to the boat, although considerably vexed and hurt; and the Quangle-Wangle’s right foot was so knocked about, that he had to sit with his head in his slipper for at least a week.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>This event made them all for a time rather melancholy: and perhaps they might never have become less so, had not Lionel, with a most praiseworthy devotion and perseverance, continued to stand on one leg, and whistle to them in a loud and lively manner; which diverted the whole party so extremely that they gradually recovered their spirits, and agreed that whenever they should reach home, they would subscribe towards a testimonial to Lionel, entirely made of gingerbread and raspberries, as an earnest token of their sincere and grateful infection.</p>

					</figure>
					<p>After sailing on calmly for several more days, they came to another country, where they were much pleased and surprised to see a countless multitude of white Mice with red eyes, all sitting in a great circle, slowly eating custard-pudding with the most satisfactory and polite demeanor.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-12">

					</figure>
					<p>And as the four travellers were rather hungry, being tired of eating nothing but soles and oranges for so long a period, they held a council as to the propriety of asking the Mice for some of their pudding in a humble and affecting manner, by which they could hardly be otherwise than gratified. It was agreed, therefore, that Guy should go and ask the Mice, which he immediately did; and the result was, that they gave a walnut-shell only half full of custard diluted with water. Now, this displeased Guy, who said, “Out of such a lot of pudding as you have got, I must say, you might have spared a somewhat larger quantity.” But no sooner had he finished speaking than the Mice turned round at once, and sneezed at him in an appalling and vindictive manner (and it is impossible to imagine a more scroobious and unpleasant sound than that caused by the simultaneous sneezing of many millions of angry Mice); so that Guy rushed back to the boat, having first shied his cap into the middle of the custard-pudding, by which means he completely spoiled the Mice’s dinner.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-13">

					</figure>
					<p>By and by the four children came to a country where there were no houses, but only an incredibly innumerable number of large bottles without corks, and of a dazzling and sweetly susceptible blue color. Each of these blue bottles contained a Bluebottle-Fly; and all these interesting animals live continually together in the most copious and rural harmony: nor perhaps in many parts of the world is such perfect and abject happiness to be found. Violet and Slingsby and Guy and Lionel were greatly struck with this singular and instructive settlement; and, having previously asked permission of the Bluebottle-Flies (which was most courteously granted), the boat was drawn up to the shore, and they proceeded to make tea in front of the bottles: but as they had no tea-leaves, they merely placed some pebbles in the hot water; and the Quangle-Wangle played some tunes over it on an accordion, by which, of course, tea was made directly, and of the very best quality.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-14">
						<img alt="The children and the Quangle-Wangle come upon a row of large bottles inhabited by flies." src="../images/illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-14.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent se:image.style.realistic"/>
					</figure>
					<p>The four children then entered into conversation with the Bluebottle-Flies, who discoursed in a placid and genteel manner, though with a slightly buzzing accent, chiefly owing to the fact that they each held a small clothes-brush between their teeth, which naturally occasioned a fizzy, extraneous utterance.</p>
					<p>“Why,” said Violet, “would you kindly inform us, do you reside in bottles; and, if in bottles at all, why not, rather, in green or purple, or, indeed, in yellow bottles?”</p>
					<p>To which questions a very aged Bluebottle-Fly answered, “We found the bottles here all ready to live in; that is to say, our great-great-great-great-great-grandfathers did: so we occupied them at once. And, when the winter comes on, we turn the bottles upside down, and consequently rarely feel the cold at all; and you know very well that this could not be the case with bottles of any other color than blue.”</p>
					<p>“Of course it could not,” said Slingsby. “But, if we may take the liberty of inquiring, on what do you chiefly subsist?”</p>
					<p>“Mainly on oyster-patties,” said the Bluebottle-Fly; “and, when these are scarce, on raspberry vinegar and Russian leather boiled down to a jelly.”</p>
					<p>“How delicious!” said Guy.</p>
					<p>To which Lionel added, “Huzz!” And all the Bluebottle-Flies said, “Buzz!”</p>
					<p>At this time, an elderly Fly said it was the hour for the evening-song to be sung; and, on a signal being given, all the Bluebottle-Flies began to buzz at once in a sumptuous and sonorous manner, the melodious and mucilaginous sounds echoing all over the waters, and resounding across the tumultuous tops of the transitory titmice upon the intervening and verdant mountains with a serene and sickly suavity only known to the truly virtuous. The Moon was shining slobaciously from the star-bespangled sky, while her light irrigated the smooth and shiny sides and wings and backs of the Bluebottle-Flies with a peculiar and trivial splendor, while all Nature cheerfully responded to the cerulean and conspicuous circumstances.</p>
					<p>In many long-after years, the four little travellers looked back to that evening as one of the happiest in all their lives; and it was already past midnight when⁠—the sail of the boat having been set up by the Quangle-Wangle, the teakettle and churn placed in their respective positions, and the Pussycat stationed at the helm⁠—the children each took a last and affectionate farewell of the Bluebottle-Flies, who walked down in a body to the water’s edge to see the travellers embark.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-15">
						<img alt="As a way of saying goodbye, the children offer gifts. Violet gives one of her feathers to a fly. Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel each offer a small box." src="../images/illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-15.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent se:image.style.realistic"/>
					</figure>
					<p>As a token of parting respect and esteem, Violet made a courtesy quite down to the ground, and stuck one of her few remaining parrot-tail feathers into the back hair of the most pleasing of the Bluebottle-Flies; while Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel offered them three small boxes, containing, respectively, black pins, dried figs, and Epsom salts; and thus they left that happy shore forever.</p>
					<p>Overcome by their feelings, the four little travellers instantly jumped into the teakettle, and fell fast asleep. But all along the shore, for many hours, there was distinctly heard a sound of severely-suppressed sobs, and of a vague multitude of living creatures using their pocket-handkerchiefs in a subdued simultaneous snuffle, lingering sadly along the walloping waves as the boat sailed farther and farther away from the Land of the Happy Bluebottle-Flies.</p>
					<p>Nothing particular occurred for some days after these events, except that, as the travellers were passing a low tract of sand, they perceived an unusual and gratifying spectacle; namely, a large number of Crabs and Crawfish⁠—perhaps six or seven hundred⁠—sitting by the waterside, and endeavoring to disentangle a vast heap of pale pink worsted, which they moistened at intervals with a fluid composed of lavender-water and white-wine negus.</p>
					<p>“Can we be of any service to you, O crusty Crabbies?” said the four children.</p>
					<p>“Thank you kindly,” said the Crabs consecutively. “We are trying to make some worsted mittens, but do not know how.”</p>
					<p>On which Violet, who was perfectly acquainted with the art of mitten-making, said to the Crabs, “Do your claws unscrew, or are they fixtures?”</p>
					<p>“They are all made to unscrew,” said the Crabs; and forthwith they deposited a great pile of claws close to the boat, with which Violet uncombed all the pale pink worsted, and then made the loveliest mittens with it you can imagine. These the Crabs, having resumed and screwed on their claws, placed cheerfully upon their wrists, and walked away rapidly on their hind-legs, warbling songs with a silvery voice and in a minor key.</p>
					<p>After this, the four little people sailed on again till they came to a vast and wide plain of astonishing dimensions, on which nothing whatever could be discovered at first; but, as the travellers walked onward, there appeared in the extreme and dim distance a single object, which on a nearer approach, and on an accurately cutaneous inspection, seemed to be somebody in a large white wig, sitting on an armchair made of sponge-cakes and oyster-shells. “It does not quite look like a human being,” said Violet doubtfully; nor could they make out what it really was, till the Quangle-Wangle (who had previously been round the world) exclaimed softly in a loud voice, “It is the cooperative Cauliflower!”</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-16">
						<img alt="Everyone is looking at a large cauliflower while the sun sits low in the sky." src="../images/illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-16.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent se:image.style.realistic"/>
					</figure>
					<p>And so, in truth, it was: and they soon found that what they had taken for an immense wig was in reality the top of the Cauliflower; and that he had no feet at all, being able to walk tolerably well with a fluctuating and graceful movement on a single cabbage-stalk⁠—an accomplishment which naturally saved him the expense of stockings and shoes.</p>
					<p>Presently, while the whole party from the boat was gazing at him with mingled affection and disgust, he suddenly arose, and, in a somewhat plumdomphious manner, hurried off towards the setting sun⁠—his steps supported by two superincumbent confidential Cucumbers, and a large number of Waterwagtails proceeding in advance of him by three and three in a row⁠—till he finally disappeared on the brink of the western sky in a crystal cloud of sudorific sand.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-17">
						<img alt="A large shadow sits in front of the setting sun." src="../images/illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-17.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent se:image.style.realistic"/>
					</figure>
					<p>So remarkable a sight, of course, impressed the four children very deeply; and they returned immediately to their boat with a strong sense of undeveloped asthma and a great appetite.</p>
					<p>Shortly after this, the travellers were obliged to sail directly below some high overhanging rocks, from the top of one of which a particularly odious little boy, dressed in rose-colored knickerbockers, and with a pewter plate upon his head, threw an enormous pumpkin at the boat, by which it was instantly upset.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-18">
						<img alt="An angry boy is throwing a pumpkin off the side of a cliff." src="../images/illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-18.svg" epub:type="z3998:illustration se:image.color-depth.black-on-transparent se:image.style.realistic"/>
					</figure>
					<p>But this upsetting was of no consequence, because all the party knew how to swim very well: and, in fact, they preferred swimming about till after the moon rose; when, the water growing chilly, they sponge-taneously entered the boat. Meanwhile the Quangle-Wangle threw back the pumpkin with immense force, so that it hit the rocks where the malicious little boy in rose-colored knickerbockers was sitting; when, being quite full of lucifer-matches, the pumpkin exploded surreptitiously into a thousand bits; whereon the rocks instantly took fire, and the odious little boy became unpleasantly hotter and hotter and hotter, till his knickerbockers were turned quite green, and his nose was burnt off.</p>
					<p>Two or three days after this had happened, they came to another place, where they found nothing at all except some wide and deep pits full of mulberry-jam. This is the property of the tiny, yellow-nosed Apes who abound in these districts, and who store up the mulberry-jam for their food in winter, when they mix it with pellucid pale periwinkle-soup, and serve it out in wedgewood china-bowls, which grow freely all over that part of the country. Only one of the yellow-nosed Apes was on the spot, and he was fast asleep; yet the four travellers and the Quangle-Wangle and Pussy were so terrified by the violence and sanguinary sound of his snoring, that they merely took a small cupful of the jam, and returned to re-embark in their boat without delay.</p>
					<p>What was their horror on seeing the boat (including the churn and the teakettle) in the mouth of an enormous Seeze Pyder, an aquatic and ferocious creature truly dreadful to behold, and, happily, only met with in those excessive longitudes! In a moment, the beautiful boat was bitten into fifty-five thousand million hundred billion bits; and it instantly became quite clear that Violet, Slingsby, Guy, and Lionel could no longer preliminate their voyage by sea.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-19">

					</figure>
					<p>The four travellers were therefore obliged to resolve on pursuing their wanderings by land: and, very fortunately, there happened to pass by at that moment an elderly Rhinoceros, on which they seized; and, all four mounting on his back⁠—the Quangle-Wangle sitting on his horn, and holding on by his ears, and the Pussycat swinging at the end of his tail⁠—they set off, having only four small beans and three pounds of mashed potatoes to last through their whole journey.</p>
					<figure id="illustration-the-story-of-the-four-little-children-who-went-round-the-world-20">
						<img alt="A large rhinoceros is carrying the children on his back. The Quangle-Wangle is holding onto the horn, and the cat is swinging by the tail.

					</figure>
					<p>They were, however, able to catch numbers of the chickens and turkeys and other birds who incessantly alighted on the head of the Rhinoceros for the purpose of gathering the seeds of the rhododendron-plants which grew there; and these creatures they cooked in the most translucent and satisfactory manner by means of a fire lighted on the end of the Rhinoceros’s back. A crowd of Kangaroos and gigantic Cranes accompanied them, from feelings of curiosity and complacency; so that they were never at a loss for company, and went onward, as it were, in a sort of profuse and triumphant procession.</p>
					<p>Thus in less than eighteen weeks they all arrived safely at home, where they were received by their admiring relatives with joy tempered with contempt, and where they finally resolved to carry out the rest of their travelling-plans at some more favorable opportunity.</p>
					<p>As for the Rhinoceros, in token of their grateful adherence, they had him killed and stuffed directly, and then set him up outside the door of their father’s house as a diaphanous doorscraper.</p>

						<p>In former days⁠—that is to say, once upon a time⁠—there lived in the Land of Gramble-Blamble seven families.

The names of all these places you have probably heard of; and you have only not to look in your geography-books to find out all about them.</p>

							<p epub:type="title">The Children of the Seven Families Are Sent Away</p>
						</hgroup>
						<p>One day all the seven fathers and the seven mothers of the seven families agreed that they would send their children out to see the world.</p>
						<p>So they called them all together, and gave them each eight shillings and some good advice, some chocolate-drops, and a small green morocco pocketbook to set down their expenses in.</p>
						<p>They then particularly entreated them not to quarrel; and all the parents sent off their children with a parting injunction.</p>
						<p>“If,” said the old Parrots, “you find a cherry, do not fight about who should have it.”</p>
						<p>“And,” said the old Storks, “if you find a frog, divide it carefully into seven bits, but on no account quarrel about it.”</p>
						<p>And the old Geese said to the seven young Geese, “Whatever you do, be sure you do not touch a plum-pudding flea.”</p>

						<p>When the seven young Storks set out, they walked or flew for fourteen weeks in a straight line, and for six weeks more in a crooked one; and after that they ran as hard as they could for one hundred and eight miles; and after that they stood still, and made a himmeltanious chatter-clatter-blattery noise with their bills.</p>

						<div epub:type="z3998:poem">

						</hgroup>
						<p>When the seven young Geese began to travel, they went over a large plain, on which there was but one tree, and that was, a very bad one.</p>
						<p>So four of them went up to the top of it, and looked about them; while the other three waddled up and down, and repeated poetry, and their last six lessons in arithmetic, geography, and cookery.</p>
						<p>Presently they perceived, a long way off, an object of the most interesting and obese appearance, having a perfectly round body exactly resembling a boiled plum-pudding, with two little wings, and a beak, and three feathers growing out of his head, and only one leg.</p>
						<p>So, after a time, all the seven young Geese said to each other, “Beyond all doubt this beast must be a Plum-pudding Flea!”</p>
						<p>On which they incautiously began to sing aloud,</p>
						<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
							<p>
								<span>“Plum-pudding Flea,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Plum-pudding Flea,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Wherever you be,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Oh! come to our tree,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And listen, oh! listen, oh! listen to me!”</span>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p>And no sooner had they sung this verse than the Plum-pudding Flea began to hop and skip on his one leg with the most dreadful velocity, and came straight to the tree, where he stopped, and looked about him in a vacant and voluminous manner.</p>
						<p>On which the seven young Geese were greatly alarmed, and all of a tremble-bemble: so one of them put out his long neck, and just touched him with the tip of his bill; but no sooner had he done this than the Plum-pudding Flea skipped and hopped about more and more, and higher and higher; after which he opened his mouth, and, to the great surprise and indignation of the seven Geese, began to bark so loudly and furiously and terribly, that they were totally unable to bear the noise; and by degrees every one of them suddenly tumbled down quite dead.</p>
						<p>So that was the end of the seven young Geese.</p>

						<p>When the seven young Owls set out, they sat every now and then on the branches of old trees, and never went far at one time.</p>
						<p>And one night, when it was quite dark, they thought they heard a mouse; but, as the gas-lamps were not lighted, they could not see him.</p>
						<p>So they called out, “Is that a mouse?”</p>
						<p>On which a mouse answered, “Squeaky-peeky-weeky! yes, it is!”</p>
						<p>And immediately all the young Owls threw themselves off the tree, meaning to alight on the ground; but they did not perceive that there was a large well below them, into which they all fell superficially, and were every one of them drowned in less than half a minute.</p>
						<p>So that was the end of the seven young Owls.</p>

						<p>The seven young Guinea Pigs went into a garden full of gooseberry-bushes and tiggory-trees, under one of which they fell asleep. When they awoke, they saw a large lettuce, which had grown out of the ground while they had been sleeping, and which had an immense number of green leaves. At which they all exclaimed⁠—</p>

						</blockquote>
						<p>And instantly the seven young Guinea Pigs rushed with such extreme force against the lettuce-plant, and hit their heads so vividly against its stalk, that the concussion brought on directly an incipient transitional inflammation of their noses, which grew worse and worse and worse and worse, till it incidentally killed them all seven.</p>

						<p>The seven young Cats set off on their travels with great delight and rapacity. But, on coming to the top of a high hill, they perceived at a long distance off a Clangle-Wangle (or, as it is more properly written, Clangel-Wangel); and, in spite of the warning they had had, they ran straight up to it.</p>
						<p>(Now, the Clangle-Wangle is a most dangerous and delusive beast, and by no means commonly to be met with. They live in the water as well as on land, using their long tail as a sail when in the former element. Their speed is extreme; but their habits of life are domestic and superfluous, and their general demeanor pensive and pellucid. On summer evenings, they may sometimes be observed near the Lake Pipple-Popple, standing on their heads, and humming their national melodies. They subsist entirely on vegetables, excepting when they eat veal or mutton or pork or beef or fish or saltpetre.)</p>
						<p>The moment the Clangle-Wangle saw the seven young Cats approach, he ran away; and as he ran straight on for four months, and the Cats, though they continued to run, could never overtake him, they all gradually <em>died</em> of fatigue and exhaustion, and never afterwards recovered.</p>
						<p>And this was the end of the seven young Cats.</p>

								<p>Cover them with water, and boil them for 8 hours incessantly; after which add 2 pints of new milk, and proceed to boil for 4 hours more.</p>

								<p>Grate some nutmeg over the surface, and cover them carefully with powdered gingerbread, curry-powder, and a sufficient quantity of Cayenne pepper.</p>

							<li>
								<p>Watch patiently till the crust begins to rise, and add a pinch of salt from time to time.</p>

							<li>
								<p>When the whole is thus minced, brush it up hastily with a new clothes-brush, and stir round rapidly and capriciously with a salt-spoon or a soup-ladle.</p>

							<li>
								<p>At the end of that time add a little lavender, some oil of almonds, and a few herring-bones; and then cover the whole with 4 gallons of clarified Crumbobblious sauce, when it will be ready for use.</p>

							<li>
								<p>Cut it into the shape of ordinary cutlets, and serve up in a clean tablecloth or dinner-napkin.</p>

								<p>Take a pig three or four years of age, and tie him by the off hind-leg to a post. Place 5 pounds of currants, 3 of sugar, 2 pecks of peas, 18 roast chestnuts, a candle, and 6 bushels of turnips, within his reach: if he eats these, constantly provide him with more.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>Then procure some cream, some slices of Cheshire cheese, 4 quires of foolscap paper, and a packet of black pins. Work the whole into a paste, and spread it out to dry on a sheet of clean brown waterproof linen.</p>
							</li>
							<li>
								<p>When the paste is perfectly dry, but not before, proceed to beat the pig violently with the handle of a large broom. If he squeals, beat him again.</p>
