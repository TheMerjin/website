									<br/>
									<span>And the premised flames of the last day</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,</span>
									<br/>

									<span>Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Into as many gobbets will I cut it</span>

									<span>As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:</span>
