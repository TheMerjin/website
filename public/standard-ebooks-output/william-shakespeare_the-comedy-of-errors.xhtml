									<span>A heavier task could not have been imposed</span>

									<span>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I’ll utter what my sorrow gives me leave.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</span>
									<br/>
									<span>By prosperous voyages I often made</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To Epidamnum; till my factor’s death</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And the great care of goods at random left</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From whom my absence was not six months old</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before herself, almost at fainting under</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had made provision for her following me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>There had she not been long but she became</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, which was strange, the one so like the other</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As could not be distinguish’d but by names.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That very hour and in the self-same inn</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A meaner woman was delivered</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Those, for their parents were exceeding poor,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Made daily motions for our home return:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Unwilling I agreed; alas! too soon</span>
									<br/>
									<span>We came aboard.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A league from Epidamnum had we sail’d,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Before the always wind-obeying deep</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But longer did we not retain much hope;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And this it was, for other means was none:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Had fasten’d him unto a small spare mast,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To him one of the other twins was bound,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix’d,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Fasten’d ourselves at either end the mast;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And, by the benefit of his wished light,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The seas wax’d calm, and we discovered</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Two ships from far making amain to us,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</span>
									<br/>
