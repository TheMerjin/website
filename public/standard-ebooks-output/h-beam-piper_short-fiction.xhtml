			<h2 epub:type="title">A Slave Is a Slave</h2>
			<p>Jurgen, Prince Trevannion, accepted the coffee cup and lifted it to his lips, then lowered it. These Navy robots always poured coffee too hot; spacemen must have collapsium-lined throats. With the other hand, he punched a button on the robot’s keyboard and received a lighted cigarette; turning, he placed the cup on the command-desk in front of him and looked about. The tension was relaxing in Battle-Control, the purposeful pandemonium of the last three hours dying rapidly. Officers of both sexes, in red and blue and yellow and green coveralls, were rising from seats, leaving their stations, gathering in groups. Laughter, a trifle loud; he realized, suddenly, that they had been worried, and wondered if he should not have been a little so himself. No. There would have been nothing he could have done about anything, so worry would not have been useful. He lifted the cup again and sipped cautiously.</p>
			<p>“That’s everything we can do now,” the man beside him said. “Now we just sit and wait for the next move.”</p>
			<p>Like all the others, Line-Commodore Vann Shatrak wore shipboard battledress; his coveralls were black, splashed on breast and between shoulders with the gold insignia of his rank. His head was completely bald, and almost spherical; a beaklike nose carried down the curve of his brow, and the straight lines of mouth and chin chopped under it enhanced rather than spoiled the effect. He was getting coffee; he gulped it at once.</p>
			<p>“It was very smart work, Commodore. I never saw a landing operation go so smoothly.”</p>
			<p>“Too smooth,” Shatrak said. “I don’t trust it.” He looked suspiciously up at the row of viewscreens.</p>
			<p>“It was absolutely unnecessary!”</p>
			<p>That was young Obray, Count Erskyll, seated on the commodore’s left. He was a generation younger than Prince Trevannion, as Shatrak was a generation older; they were both smooth-faced. It was odd, how beards went in and out of fashion with alternate generations. He had been worried, too, during the landing, but for a different reason from the others. Now he was reacting with anger.</p>
			<p>“I told you, from the first, that it was unnecessary. You see? They weren’t even able to defend themselves, let alone.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>His personal communication-screen buzzed; he set down the coffee and flicked the switch. It was Lanze Degbrend. On the books, Lanze was carried as Assistant to the Ministerial Secretary. In practice, Lanze was his chess-opponent, conversational foil, right hand, third eye and ear, and, sometimes, trigger-finger. Lanze was now wearing the combat coveralls of an officer of Navy Landing-Troops; he had a steel helmet with a transpex visor shoved up, and there was a carbine slung over his shoulder. He grinned and executed an exaggeratedly military salute. He chuckled.</p>
			<p>“Well, look at you; aren’t you the perfect picture of correct diplomatic dress?”</p>
			<p>“You know, sir, I’m afraid I am, for this planet,” Degbrend said. “Colonel Ravney insisted on it. He says the situation downstairs is still fluid, which I take to mean that everybody is shooting at everybody. He says he has the main telecast station, in the big building the locals call the Citadel.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, good. Get our announcement out as quickly as you can. Number Five. You and Colonel Ravney can decide what interpolations are needed to fit the situation.”</p>
			<p>“Number Five; the really tough one,” Degbrend considered. “I take it that by interpolations you do not mean dilutions?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no; don’t water the drink. Spike it.”</p>
			<p>Lanze Degbrend grinned at him. Then he snapped down the visor of his helmet, unslung his carbine, and presented it. He was still standing at present arms when Trevannion blanked the screen.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“That still doesn’t excuse a wanton and unprovoked aggression!” Erskyll was telling Shatrak, his thin face flushed and his voice quivering with indignation. “We came here to help these people, not to murder them.”</p>
			<p>“We didn’t come here to do either, Obray,” he said, turning to face the younger man. “We came here to annex their planet to the Galactic Empire, whether they wish it annexed or not. Commodore Shatrak used the quickest and most effective method of doing that. It would have done no good to attempt to parley with them from off-planet. You heard those telecasts of theirs.”</p>
			<p>“Authoritarian,” Shatrak said, then mimicked pompously: “ ‘Everybody is commanded to remain calm; the Mastership is taking action. The Convocation of the Lords-Master is in special session; they will decide how to deal with the invaders. The administrators are directed to reassure the supervisors; the overseers will keep the workers at their tasks. Any person disobeying the orders of the Mastership will be dealt with most severely.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Static, too. No spaceships into this system for the last five hundred years; the Convocation⁠—equals Parliament, I assume⁠—hasn’t been in special session for two hundred and fifty.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. I’ve taken over planets with that kind of government before,” Shatrak said. “You can’t argue with them. You just grab them by the center of authority, quick and hard.”</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll said nothing for a moment. He was opposed to the use of force. Force, he believed, was the last resort of incompetence; he had said so frequently enough since this operation had begun. Of course, he was absolutely right, though not in the way he meant. Only the incompetent wait until the last extremity to use force, and by then, it is usually too late to use anything, even prayer.</p>
			<p>But, at the same time, he was opposed to authoritarianism, except, of course, when necessary for the real good of the people. And he did not like rulers who called themselves Lords-Master. Good democratic rulers called themselves Servants of the People. So he relapsed into silence and stared at the viewscreens.</p>
			<p>One, from an outside pickup on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i> herself, showed the surface of the planet, a hundred miles down, the continent under them curving away to a distant sun-reflecting sea; beyond the curved horizon, the black sky was spangled with unwinking stars. Fifty miles down, the sun glinted from the three thousand foot globes of the two transport-cruisers, <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Canopus</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Mizar</i>.</p>
			<p>Another screen, from <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Mizar</i>, gave a clearer if more circumscribed view of the surface⁠—green countryside, veined by rivers and wrinkled with mountains; little towns that were mere dots; a scatter of white clouds. Nothing that looked like roads. There had been no native sapient race on this planet, and in the thirteen centuries since it had been colonized the Terro-human population had never completely lost the use of contragravity vehicles. In that screen, farther down, the four destroyers, <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irma</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irene</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Isobel</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Iris</i>, were tiny twinkles.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>From <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irene</i>, they had a magnified view of the city. On the maps, none later than eight hundred years old, it was called Zeggensburg; it had been built at the time of the first colonization under the old Terran Federation. Tall buildings, rising from wide interspaces of lawns and parks and gardens, and, at the very center, widely separated from anything else, the mass of the Citadel, a huge cylindrical tower rising from a cluster of smaller cylinders, with a broad circular landing stage above, topped by the newly raised flag of the Galactic Empire.</p>
			<p>There was a second city, a thick crescent, to the south and east. The old maps placed the Zeggensburg spaceport there, but not a trace of that remained. In its place was what was evidently an industrial district, located where the prevailing winds would carry away the dust and smoke. There was quite a bit of both, but the surprising thing was the streets, long curved ones, and shorter ones crossing at regular intervals to form blocks. He had never seen a city with streets before, and he doubted if anybody else on the Empire ships had. Long boulevards to give unobstructed passage to low-level air-traffic, of course, and short winding walkways, but not things like these. Pictures, of course, of native cities on planets colonized at the time of the Federation, and even very ancient ones of cities on pre-Atomic Terra. But these people had contragravity; the towering, wide-spaced city beside this cross-gridded anachronism proved that.</p>
			<p>They knew so little about this planet which they had come to bring under Imperial rule. It had been colonized thirteen centuries ago, during the last burst of expansion before the System States War and the disintegration of the Terran Federation, and it had been named Aditya, in the fashion of the times, for some forgotten deity of some obscure and ancient polytheism. A century or so later, it had seceded from or been abandoned by the Federation, then breaking up. That much they had gleaned from old Federation records still existing on Baldur. After that, darkness, lighted only by a brief flicker when more records had turned up on Morglay.</p>
			<p>Morglay was one of the Sword-Worlds, settled by refugee rebels from the System States planets. Mostly they had been soldiers and spacemen; there had been many women with them, and many were skilled technicians, engineers, scientists. They had managed to carry off considerable equipment with them, and for three centuries they had lived in isolation, spreading over a dozen hitherto undiscovered planets. Excalibur, Tizona, Gram, Morglay, Durendal, Flamberge, Curtana, Quernbiter; the names were a roll-call of fabulous blades of Old Terran legend.</p>
			<p>Then they had erupted, suddenly and calamitously, into what was left of the Terran Federation as the Space Vikings, carrying pillage and destruction, until the newborn Empire rose to vanquish them. In the sixth Century Pre-Empire, one of their fleets had come from Morglay to Aditya.</p>
			<p>The Adityans of that time had been near-barbarians; the descendants of the original settlers had been serfs of other barbarians who had come as mercenaries in the service of one or another of the local chieftains and had remained to loot and rule. Subjugating them had been easy; the Space Vikings had taken Aditya and made it their home. For several centuries, there had been communication between them and their home planet. Then Morglay had become involved in one of the interplanetary dynastic wars that had begun the decadence of the Space Vikings, and again Aditya dropped out of history.</p>
			<p>Until this morning, when history returned in the black ships of the Galactic Empire.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He stubbed out the cigarette and summoned the robot to give him another. Shatrak was speaking:</p>
			<p>“You see, Count Erskyll, we really had to do it this way, for their own good.” He wouldn’t have credited the commodore with such guile; anything was justified, according to Obray of Erskyll, if done for somebody else’s good. “What we did, we just landed suddenly, knocked out their army, seized the center of government, before anybody could do anything. If we’d landed the way you’d wanted us to, somebody would have resisted, and the next thing, we’d have had to kill about five or six thousand of them and blow down a couple of towns, and we’d have lost a lot of our own people doing it. You might say, we had to do it to save them from themselves.”</p>
			<p>Obray of Erskyll seemed to have doubts, but before he could articulate them, Shatrak’s communication-screen was calling attention to itself. The commodore flicked the switch, and his executive officer, Captain Patrique Morvill, appeared in it.</p>
			<p>“We’ve just gotten reports, sir, that some of Ravney’s people have captured a half-dozen missile-launching sites around the city. His air-reconn tells him that that’s the lot of them. I have an officer of one of the parties that participated. You ought to hear what he has to say, sir.”</p>
			<p>“Well, good!” Vann Shatrak whooshed out his breath. “I don’t mind admitting, I was a little on edge about that.”</p>
			<p>“Wait till you hear what Lieutenant Carmath has to say.” Morvill seemed to be strangling a laugh. “Ready for him, Commodore?”</p>
			<p>Shatrak nodded; Morvill made a hand-signal and vanished in a flicker of rainbow colors; when the screen cleared, a young Landing-Troop lieutenant in battledress was looking out of it. He saluted and gave his name, rank and unit.</p>
			<p>“This missile-launching site I’m occupying, sir; it’s twenty miles northwest of the city. We took it thirty minutes ago; no resistance whatever. There are four hundred or so people here. Of them, twelve, one dozen, are soldiers. The rest are civilians. Ten enlisted men, a noncom of some sort, and something that appears to be an officer. The officer had a pistol, fully loaded. The noncom had a submachine gun, empty, with two loaded clips on his belt. The privates had rifles, empty, and no ammunition. The officer did not know where the rifle ammunition was stored.”</p>
			<p>Shatrak swore. The second lieutenant nodded. “Exactly my comment when he told me, sir. But this place is beautifully kept up. Lawns all mowed, trees neatly pruned, everything policed up like inspection morning. And there is a headquarters office building here adequate for an army division.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“How about the armament, Lieutenant?” Shatrak asked with forced patience.</p>
			<p>“Ah, yes; the armament, sir. There are eight big launching cradles for panplanetary or off-planet missiles. They are all polished up like the Crown Jewels. But none, repeat none, of them is operative. And there is not a single missile on the installation.”</p>
			<p>Shatrak’s facial control didn’t slip. It merely intensified, which amounted to the same thing.</p>
			<p>“Lieutenant Carmath, I am morally certain I heard you correctly, but let’s just check. You said.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>He repeated the lieutenant back, almost word for word. Carmath nodded.</p>
			<p>“That was it, sir. The missile-crypts are stacked full of old photoprints and recording and microfilm spools. The sighting-and-guidance systems for all the launchers are completely missing. The letoff mechanisms all lack major parts. There is an elaborate set of detection equipment, which will detect absolutely nothing. I saw a few pairs of binoculars about; I suspect that that is what we were first observed with.”</p>
			<p>“This office, now; I suppose all the paperwork is up to the minute in quintulplicate, and initialed by everybody within sight or hearing?”</p>
			<p>“I haven’t checked on that yet, sir. If you’re thinking of betting on it, please don’t expect me to cover you, though.”</p>
			<p>“Well, thank you, Lieutenant Carmath. Stick around; I’m sending down a tech-intelligence crew to look at what’s left of the place. While you’re waiting, you might sort out whoever seems to be in charge and find out just what in Nifflheim he thinks that launching-station was maintained for.”</p>
			<p>“I think I can tell you that, now, Commodore,” Prince Trevannion said as Shatrak blanked the screen. “We have a petrified authoritarianism. Quite likely some sort of an oligarchy; I’d guess that this Convocation thing they talk about consists of all the ruling class, everybody has equal voice, and nobody will take the responsibility for doing anything. And the actual work of government is probably handled by a corps of bureaucrats entrenched in their jobs, unwilling to exert any effort and afraid to invite any criticism, and living only to retire on their pensions. I’ve seen governments like that before.” He named a few. “One thing; once a government like that has been bludgeoned into the Empire, it rarely makes any trouble later.”</p>
			<p>“Just to judge by this missileless non-launching station,” Shatrak said, “they couldn’t even decide on what kind of trouble to make, or how to start it. I think you’re going to have a nice easy Proconsulate here, Count Erskyll.”</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll started to say something. No doubt he was about to tell Shatrak, cuttingly, that he didn’t want an easy Proconsulate, but an opportunity to help these people. He was saved from this by the buzzing of Shatrak’s communication-screen.</p>
			<p>It was Colonel Pyairr Ravney, the Navy Landing-Troop commander. Like everybody else who had gone down to Zeggensburg, he was in battledress and armed; the transpex visor of his helmet was pushed up. Between Shatrak’s generation and Count Erskyll’s, he sported a pointed mustache and a spiky chin-beard, which, on his thin and dark-eyed face, looked distinctly Mephistophelean. He was grinning.</p>
			<p>“Well, sir, I think we can call it a done job,” he said. “There’s a delegation here who want to talk to the Lords-Master of the ships on behalf of the Lords-Master of the Convocation. Two of them, with about a dozen portfolio-bearers and note-takers. I’m not too good in Lingua Terra, outside Basic, at best, and their brand is far from that. I gather that they’re some kind of civil-servants, personal representatives of the top Lords-Master.”</p>
			<p>“Do we want to talk to them?” Shatrak asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, we should only talk to the actual, titular, heads of the government⁠—Mastership,” Erskyll, suddenly protocol-conscious, objected. “We can’t negotiate with subordinates.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, who’s talking about negotiating; there isn’t anything to negotiate. Aditya is now a part of the Galactic Empire. If this present regime assents to that, they can stay in power. If not, we will toss them out and install a new government. We will receive this delegation, inform them to that effect, and send them back to relay the information to their Lords-Master.” He turned to the Commodore. “May I speak to Colonel Ravney?”</p>
			<p>Shatrak assented. He asked Ravney where these Lords-Master were.</p>
			<p>“Here in the Citadel, in what they call the Convocation Chamber. Close to a thousand of them, screaming recriminations at one another. Sounds like feeding time at the Imperial Zoo. I think they all want to surrender, but nobody dares propose it first. I’ve just put a cordon around it and placed it off limits to everybody. And everything outside off limits to the Convocation.”</p>
			<p>“Well thought of, Colonel. I suppose the Citadel teems with bureaucrats and such low life-forms?”</p>
			<p>“Bulging with them. Literally thousands. Lanze Degbrend and Commander Douvrin and a few others are trying to get some sensible answers out of some of them.”</p>
			<p>“This delegation; how had you thought of sending them up?”</p>
			<p>“Landing-craft to <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Isobel</i>; <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Isobel</i> will bring them the rest of the way.”</p>
			<p>He looked at his watch. “Well, don’t be in too much of a rush to get them here, Colonel. We don’t want them till after lunch. Delay them on <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Isobel</i>; the skipper can see that they have their own lunch aboard. And entertain them with some educational films. Something to convince them that there is slightly more to the Empire than one ship-of-the-line, two cruisers and four destroyers.”</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll was dissatisfied about that, too. He wanted to see the delegation at once and make arrangements to talk to their superiors. Count Erskyll, among other things, was zealous, and of this he disapproved. Zealous statesmen perhaps did more mischief than anything in the Galaxy⁠—with the possible exception of procrastinating soldiers. That could indicate the fundamental difference between statecraft and war. He’d have to play with that idea a little.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>An Empire ship-of-the-line was almost a mile in diameter. It was more than a battle-craft; it also had political functions. The grand salon, on the outer zone where the curvature of the floors was less disconcerting, was as magnificent as any but a few of the rooms of the Imperial Palace at Asgard on Odin, the floor richly carpeted and the walls alternating mirrors and paintings. The movable furniture varied according to occasion; at present, it consisted of the bare desk at which they sat, the three chairs they occupied, and the three secretary-robots, their rectangular black casts blazened with the Sun and Cogwheel of the Empire. It faced the door, at the far end of the room; on either side, a rank of spacemen, in dress uniform and under arms, stood.</p>
			<p>In principle, annexing a planet to the Empire was simplicity itself, but like so many things simple in principle, it was apt to be complicated in practice, and to this, he suspected, the present instance would be no exception.</p>
			<p>In principle, one simply informed the planetary government that it was now subject to the sovereignty of his Imperial Majesty, the Galactic Emperor. This information was always conveyed by a Ministerial Secretary, directly under the Prime Minister and only one more step down from the Emperor, in the present instance Jurgen, Prince Trevannion. To make sure that the announcement carried conviction, the presumedly glad tidings were accompanied by the Imperial Space Navy, at present represented by Commodore Vann Shatrak and a seven ship battle-line unit, and two thousand Imperial Landing-Troops.</p>
			<p>When the locals had been properly convinced⁠—with as little bloodshed as necessary, but always beyond any dispute⁠—an Imperial Proconsul, in this case Obray, Count Erskyll, would be installed. He would by no means govern the planet. The Imperial Constitution was definite on that point; every planetary government should be sovereign as to intraplanetary affairs. The Proconsul, within certain narrow and entirely inelastic limits, would merely govern the government.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, Obray, Count Erskyll, appeared not to understand this completely. It was his impression that he was a torchbearer of Imperial civilization, or something equally picturesque and metaphorical. As he conceived it, it was the duty of the Empire, as represented by himself, to make over backward planets like Aditya in the image of Odin or Marduk or Osiris or Baldur or, preferably, his own home world of Aton.</p>
			<p>This was Obray of Erskyll’s first proconsular appointment, it was due to family influence, and it was a mistake. Mistakes, of course, were inevitable in anything as large and complex as the Galactic Empire, and any institution guided by men was subject to one kind of influence or another, family influence being no worse than any other kind. In this case, the ultraconservative Erskylls of Aton, from old Errol, Duke of Yorvoy, down, had become alarmed at the political radicalism of young Obray, and had, on his graduation from the University of Nefertiti, persuaded the Prime Minister to appoint him to a Proconsulate as far from Aton as possible, where he would not embarrass them. Just at that time, more important matters having been gotten out of the way, Aditya had come up for annexation, and Obray of Erskyll had been named Proconsul.</p>
			<p>That had been the mistake. He should have been sent to some planet which had been under Imperial rule for some time, where the Proconsulate ran itself in a well-worn groove, and where he could at leisure learn the procedures and unlearn some of the unrealisms absorbed at the University from professors too well insulated from the realities of politics.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There was a stir among the guards; helmet-visors were being snapped down; feet scuffed. They stiffened to attention, the great doors at the other end of the grand salon slid open, and the guards presented arms as the Adityan delegation was ushered in.</p>
			<p>There were fourteen of them. They all wore ankle-length gowns, and they all had shaven heads. The one in the lead carried a staff and wore a pale green gown; he was apparently a herald. Behind him came two in white gowns, their empty hands folded on their breasts; one was a huge bulk of obesity with a bulging brow, protuberant eyes and a pursey little mouth, and the other was thin and cadaverous, with a skull-like, almost fleshless face. The ones behind, in dark green and pale blue, carried portfolios and slung sound-recorder cases. There was a metallic twinkle at each throat; as they approached, he could see that they all wore large silver gorgets. They came to a halt twenty feet from the desk. The herald raised his staff.</p>
			<p>“I present the Admirable and Trusty Tchall Hozhet, personal chief-slave of the Lord-Master Olvir Nikkolon, Chairman of the Presidium of the Lords-Master’s Convocation, and Khreggor Chmidd, chief-slave in office to the Lord-Master Rovard Javasan, Chief of Administration of Management of the Mastership,” he said. Then he stopped, puzzled, looking from one to another of them. When his eyes fell on Vann Shatrak, he brightened.</p>
			<p>“Are you,” he asked, “the chief-slave of the chief Lord-Master of this ship?”</p>
			<p>Shatrak’s face turned pink; the pink darkened to red. He used a word; it was a completely unprintable word. So, except for a few scattered pronouns, conjunctions and prepositions, were the next fifty words he used. The herald stiffened. The two delegates behind him were aghast. The subordinate burden-bearers in the rear began looking around apprehensively.</p>
			<p>“I,” Shatrak finally managed, “am an officer of his Imperial Majesty’s Space Navy. I am in command of this battle-line unit. I am <em>not</em>”⁠—he reverted briefly to obscenity⁠—“a slave.”</p>
			<p>“You mean, you are a Lord-Master, too?” That seemed to horrify the herald even more that the things Shatrak had been calling him. “Forgive me, Lord-Master. I did not think.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“That’s right; you didn’t,” Shatrak agreed. “And don’t call me Lord-Master again, or I’ll.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Just a moment, Commodore.” He waved the herald aside and addressed the two in white gowns, shifting to Lingua Terra. “This is a ship of the Galactic Empire,” he told them. “In the Empire, there are no slaves. Can you understand that?”</p>
			<p>Evidently not. The huge one, Khreggor Chmidd, turned to the skull-faced Tchall Hozhet, saying: “Then they must all be Lords-Master.” He saw the objection to that at once. “But how can one be a Lord-Master if there are no slaves?”</p>
			<p>The horror was not all on the visitors’ side of the desk, either. Obray of Erskyll was staring at the delegation and saying, “Slaves!” under his breath. Obray of Erskyll had never, in his not-too-long life, seen a slave before.</p>
			<p>“They can’t be,” Tchall Hozhet replied. “A Lord-Master is one who owns slaves.” He gave that a moment’s consideration. “But if they aren’t Lords-Master, they must be slaves, and.⁠ ⁠…” No. That wouldn’t do, either. “But a slave is one who belongs to a Lord-Master.”</p>
			<p>Rule of the Excluded Third; evidently Pre-Atomic formal logic had crept back to Aditya. Chmidd, looking around, saw the ranks of spacemen on either side, now at parade-rest.</p>
			<p>“But aren’t they slaves?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“They are spacemen of the Imperial Navy,” Shatrak roared. “Call one a slave to his face and you’ll get a rifle-butt in yours. And I shan’t lift a finger to stop it.” He glared at Chmidd and Hozhet. “Who had the infernal impudence to send slaves to deal with the Empire? He needs to be taught a lesson.”</p>
			<p>“Why, I was sent by the Lord-Master Olvir Nikkolon, and.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Tchall!” Chmidd hissed at him. “We cannot speak to Lords-Master. We must speak to their chief-slaves.”</p>
			<p>“But they have no slaves,” Hozhet objected. “Didn’t you hear the⁠ ⁠… the one with the small beard⁠ ⁠… say so?”</p>
			<p>“But that’s ridiculous, Khreggor. Who does the work, and who tells them what to do? Who told these people to come here?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Our Emperor sent us. That is his picture, behind me. But we are not his slaves. He is merely the chief man among us. Do your Masters not have one among them who is chief?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” Chmidd said to Hozhet. “In the Convocation, your Lord-Master is chief, and in the Mastership, my Lord-Master, Rovard Javasan, is chief.”</p>
			<p>“But they don’t tell the other Lords-Master what to do. In Convocation, the other Lords-Master tell them.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I meant about an oligarchy,” he whispered, in Imperial, to Erskyll.</p>
			<p>“Suppose we tell Ravney to herd these Lords-Master onto a couple of landing-craft and bring them up here?” Shatrak suggested. He made the suggestion in Lingua Terra Basic, and loudly.</p>
			<p>“I think we can manage without that.” He raised his voice, speaking in Lingua Terra Basic:</p>
			<p>“It does not matter whether these slaves talk to us or not. This planet is now under the rule of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. If this Mastership wants to govern the planet under the Emperor, they may do so. If not, we will make an end of them and set up a new government here.”</p>
			<p>He paused. Chmidd and Hozhet were looking at one another in shocked incredulity.</p>
			<p>“Tchall, they mean it,” Chmidd said. “They can do it, too.”</p>
			<p>“We have nothing more to say to you slaves,” he continued. “Hereafter, we will speak directly to the Lords-Master.”</p>
			<p>“But.⁠ ⁠… The Lords-Master never do business directly,” Hozhet said. “It is un-Masterly. Such discussions are between chief-slaves.”</p>
			<p>“This thing they call the Convocation,” Shatrak mentioned. “I wonder if the members have the business done entirely through their slaves.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no!” That shocked Chmidd into direct address. “No slave is allowed in the Convocation Chamber.”</p>
			<p>He wondered how they kept the place swept out. Robots, no doubt. Or else, what happened when the Masters weren’t there didn’t count.</p>
			<p>“Very well. Your people have recorders; are they on?”</p>
			<p>Hozhet asked Chmidd; Chmidd asked the herald, who asked one of the menials in the rear, who asked somebody else. The reply came back through the same channels; they were.</p>
			<p>“Very well. At this time tomorrow, we will speak to the Convocation of Lords-Master. Commodore Shatrak, see to it that Colonel Ravney has them in the Convocation Chamber, and that preparations in the room are made, so that we may address them in the dignity befitting representatives of his Imperial Majesty.” He turned to the Adityan slaves. “That is all. You have permission to go.”</p>
			<p>They watched the delegation back out, with the honor-guard following. When the doors had closed behind them, Shatrak ran his hand over his bald head and laughed.</p>
			<p>“Shaved heads, every one of them. That’s probably why they thought I was your slave. Bet those gorgets are servile badges, too.” He touched the Knight’s Star of the Order of the Empire at his throat. “Probably thought that was what this was. We would have to draw something like this!”</p>
			<p>“They simply can’t imagine anybody not being either a slave or a slave-owner,” Erskyll was saying. “That must mean that there is no free non-slave-holding class at all. Universal slavery! Well, we’ll have to do something about that. Proclaim total emancipation, immediately.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no; we can’t do anything like that. The Constitution won’t permit us to. Section Two, Article One: <q>Every Empire planet shall be self-governed as to its own affairs, in the manner of its own choice, and without interference.</q>”</p>
			<p>“But slavery.⁠ ⁠… Section Two, Article Six,” Erskyll objected. “<q>There shall be no chattel slavery or serfdom anywhere in the Empire; no sapient being of any race whatsoever shall be the property of any being but himself.</q>”</p>
			<p>“That’s correct,” he agreed. “If this Mastership intends to remain the planetary government under the Empire, they will be obliged to abolish slavery, but they will have to do it by their own act. We cannot do it for them.”</p>
			<p>“You know what I’d do, Prince Trevannion?” Shatrak said. “I’d just heave this Mastership thing out, and set up a nice tight military dictatorship. We have the planet under martial rule now; let’s just keep it that way for about five years, till we can train a new government.”</p>
			<p>That suggestion seemed to pain Count Erskyll almost as much as the existing situation.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They dined late, in Commodore Shatrak’s private dining room. Beside Shatrak, Erskyll and himself, there were Lanze Degbrend, and Count Erskyll’s charge-d’affaires, Sharll Ernanday, and Patrique Morvill and Pyairr Ravney and the naval intelligence officer, Commander Andrey Douvrin. Ordinarily, he deplored serious discussion at meals, but under the circumstances it was unavoidable; nobody could think or talk of anything else. The discussion which he had hoped would follow the meal began before the soup-course.</p>
			<p>“We have a total population of about twenty million,” Lanze Degbrend reported. “A trifle over ten thousand Masters, all ages and both sexes. The remainder are all slaves.”</p>
			<p>“I find that incredible,” Erskyll declared promptly. “Twenty million people, held in slavery by ten thousand! Why do they stand for it? Why don’t they rebel?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I can think of three good reasons,” Douvrin said. “Three square meals a day.”</p>
			<p>“And no responsibilities; no need to make decisions,” Degbrend added. “They’ve been slaves for seven and a half centuries. They don’t even know the meaning of freedom, and it would frighten them if they did.”</p>
			<p>“Chain of command,” Shatrak said. When that seemed not to convey any meaning to Erskyll, he elaborated: “We have a lot of dirty-necked working slaves. Over every dozen of them is an overseer with a big whip and a stun-gun. Over every couple of overseers there is a guard with a submachine gun. Over them is a supervisor, who doesn’t need a gun because he can grab a handphone and call for troops. Over the supervisors, there are higher supervisors. Everybody has it just enough better than the level below him that he’s afraid of losing his job and being busted back to fieldhand.”</p>
			<p>“That’s it exactly, Commodore,” Degbrend said. “The whole society is a slave hierarchy. Everybody curries favor with the echelon above, and keeps his eye on the echelon below to make sure he isn’t being undercut. We have something not too unlike that, ourselves. Any organizational society is, in some ways, like a slave society. And everything is determined by established routine. The whole thing has simply been running on momentum for at least five centuries, and if we hadn’t come smashing in with a situation none of the routines covered, it would have kept on running for another five, till everything wore out and stopped. I heard about those missile-stations, by the way. They’re typical of everything here.”</p>
			<p>“That’s another thing,” Erskyll interrupted. “These Lords-Master are the descendants of the old Space-Vikings, and the slaves of the original inhabitants. The Space Vikings were a technologically advanced people; they had all the old Terran Federation science and technology, and a lot they developed for themselves on the Sword-Worlds.”</p>
			<p>“Well? They still had a lot of it, on the Sword-Worlds, two centuries ago when we took them over.”</p>
			<p>“But technology always drives out slavery; that’s a fundamental law of socio-economics. Slavery is economically unsound; it cannot compete with power-industry, let alone cybernetics and robotics.”</p>
			<p>He was tempted to remind young Obray of Erskyll that there were no such things as fundamental laws of socio-economics; merely usually reliable generalized statements of what can more or less be depended upon to happen under most circumstances. He resisted the temptation. Count Erskyll had had enough shocks, today, without adding to them by gratuitous blasphemy.</p>
			<p>“In this case, Obray, it worked in reverse. The Space Vikings enslaved the Adityans to hold them in subjugation. That was a politico-military necessity. Then, being committed to slavery, with a slave population who had to be made to earn their keep, they found cybernetics and robotics economically unsound.”</p>
			<p>“And almost at once, they began appointing slave overseers, and the technicians would begin training slave assistants. Then there would be slave supervisors to direct the overseers, slave administrators to direct them, slave secretaries and bookkeepers, slave technicians and engineers.”</p>
			<p>“How about the professions, Lanze?”</p>
			<p>“All slave. Slave physicians, teachers, everything like that. All the Masters are taught by slaves; the slaves are educated by apprenticeship. The courts are in the hands of slaves; cases are heard by the chief slaves of judges who don’t even know where their own courtrooms are; every Master has a team of slave lawyers. Most of the lawsuits are estate-inheritance cases; some of them have been in litigation for generations.”</p>
			<p>“What do the Lords-Master do?” Shatrak asked.</p>
			<p>“Masterly things,” Degbrend replied. “I was only down there since noon, but from what I could find out, that consists of feasting, making love to each other’s wives, being entertained by slave performers, and feuding for social precedence like wealthy old ladies on Odin.”</p>
			<p>“You got this from the slaves? How did you get them to talk, Lanze?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Degbrend and Ravney exchanged amused glances. Ravney said:</p>
			<p>“Well, I detailed a sergeant and six privates to accompany Honorable Degbrend,” Ravney said. “They.⁠ ⁠… How would you put it, Lanze?”</p>
			<p>“I asked a slave a question. If he refused to answer, somebody knocked him down with a rifle-butt,” Degbrend replied. “I never had to do that more than once in any group, and I only had to do it three times in all. After that, when I asked questions, I was answered promptly and fully. It is surprising how rapidly news gets around the Citadel.”</p>
			<p>“You mean you had those poor slaves beaten?” Erskyll demanded.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no. Beating implies repeated blows. We only gave one to a customer; that was enough.”</p>
			<p>“Well, how about the army, if that’s what those people in the long red-brown coats were?” Shatrak changed the subject by asking Ravney.</p>
			<p>“All slave, of course, officers and all. What will we do about them, sir? I have about three thousand, either confined to their barracks or penned up in the Citadel. I requisitioned food for them, paid for it in chits. There were a few isolated companies and platoons that gave us something of a fight; most of them just threw away their weapons and bawled for quarter. I’ve segregated the former; with your approval, I’ll put them under Imperial officers and noncoms for a quickie training in our tactics, and then use them to train the rest.”</p>
			<p>“Do that, Pyairr. We only have two thousand men of our own, and that’s not enough. Do you think you can make soldiers out of any of them?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I believe so, sir. They are trained, organized and armed for civil-order work, which is what we’ll need them for ourselves. In the entire history of this army, all they have done has been to overawe unarmed slaves; I am sure they have never been in combat with regular troops. They have an elaborate set of training and field regulations for the sort of work for which they were intended. What they encountered today was entirely outside those regulations, which is why they behaved as they did.”</p>
			<p>“Did you have any trouble getting cooperation from the native officers?” Shatrak asked.</p>
			<p>“Not in the least. They cooperated quite willingly, if not always too intelligently. I simply told them that they were now the personal property of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. They were quite flattered by the change of ownership. If ordered to, I believe that they would fire on their former Lords-Master without hesitation.”</p>
			<p>“You told those slaves that they.⁠ ⁠… <em>belonged</em>⁠ ⁠… to the <em>Emperor</em>?”</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll was aghast. He stared at Ravney for an instant, then snatched up his brandy-glass⁠—the meal had gotten to that point⁠—and drained it at a gulp. The others watched solicitously while he coughed and spluttered over it.</p>
			<p>“Commodore Shatrak,” he said sternly. “I hope that you will take severe disciplinary action; this is the most outrageous.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“I’ll do nothing of the sort,” Shatrak retorted. “The colonel is to be commended; did the best thing he could, under the circumstances. What are you going to do when slavery is abolished here, Colonel?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, tell them that they have been given their freedom as a special reward for meritorious service, and then sign them up for a five year enlistment.”</p>
			<p>“That might work. Again, it might not.”</p>
			<p>“I think, Colonel, that before you do that, you had better disarm them again. You might possibly have some trouble, otherwise.”</p>
			<p>Ravney looked at him sharply. “They might not want to be free? I’d thought of that.”</p>
			<p>“Nonsense!” Erskyll declared. “Who ever heard of slaves rebelling against freedom?”</p>
			<p>Freedom was a Good Thing. It was a Good Thing for everybody, everywhere and all the time. Count Erskyll knew it, because freedom was a Good Thing for him.</p>
			<p>He thought, suddenly, of an old tomcat belonging to a lady of his acquaintance at Paris-on-Baldur, a most affectionate cat, who insisted on catching mice and bringing them as presents to all his human friends. To this cat’s mind, it was inconceivable that anybody would not be most happy to receive a nice fresh-killed mouse.</p>
			<p>“Too bad we have to set any of them free,” Vann Shatrak said. “Too bad we can’t just issue everybody new servile gorgets marked, <q>Personal Property of his Imperial Majesty</q> and let it go at that. But I guess we can’t.”</p>
			<p>“Commodore Shatrak, you are joking,” Erskyll began.</p>
			<p>“I hope I am,” Shatrak replied grimly.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The top landing-stage of the Citadel grew and filled the forward viewscreen of the ship’s launch. It was only when he realized that the tiny specks were people, and the larger, birdseed-sized, specks vehicles, that the real size of the thing was apparent. Obray of Erskyll, beside him, had been silent. He had been looking at the crescent-shaped industrial city, like a servile gorget around Zeggensburg’s neck.</p>
			<p>“The way they’ve been crowded together!” he said. “And the buildings; no space between. And all that smoke! They must be using fossil-fuel!”</p>
			<p>“It’s probably too hard to process fissionables in large quantities, with what they have.”</p>
			<p>“You were right, last evening. These people have deliberately halted progress, even retrogressed, rather than give up slavery.”</p>
			<p>Halting progress, to say nothing of retrogression, was an unthinkable crime to him. Like freedom, progress was a Good Thing, anywhere, at all times, and without regard to direction.</p>
			<p>Colonel Ravney met them when they left the launch. The top landing-stage was swarming with Imperial troops.</p>
			<p>“Convocation Chamber’s three stages down,” he said. “About two thousand of them there now; been coming in all morning. We have everything set up.” He laughed. “They tell me slaves are never permitted to enter it. Maybe, but they have the place bugged to the ceiling all around.”</p>
			<p>“Bugged? What with?” Shatrak asked, and Erskyll was wanting to know what he meant. No doubt he thought Ravney was talking about things crawling out of the woodwork.</p>
			<p>“Screen pickups, radio pickups, wired microphones; you name it and it’s there. I’ll bet every slave in the Citadel knows everything that happens in there while it’s happening.”</p>
			<p>Shatrak wanted to know if he had done anything about them. Ravney shook his head.</p>
			<p>“If that’s how they want to run a government, that’s how they have a right to run it. Commander Douvrin put in a few of our own, a little better camouflaged than theirs.”</p>
			<p>There were more troops on the third stage down. They formed a procession down a long empty hallway, a few scared-looking slaves peeping from doorways at them. There were more troops where the corridor ended in great double doors, emblazoned with a straight broadsword diagonally across an eight-pointed star. Emblematology of planets conquered by the Space Vikings always included swords and stars. An officer gave a signal; the doors started to slide apart, and within, from a screen-speaker, came a fanfare of trumpets.</p>
			<p>At first, all he could see was the projection-screen, far ahead, and the tessellated aisle stretching toward it. The trumpets stopped, and they advanced, and then he saw the Lords-Master.</p>
			<p>They were massed, standing among benches on either side, and if anything Pyairr Ravney had understated their numbers. They all wore black, trimmed with gold; he wondered if the coincidence that these were also the Imperial colors might be useful. Queer garments, tightly fitted tunics at the top which became flowing robes below the waist, deeply scalloped at the edges. The sleeves were exaggeratedly wide; a knife or a pistol, and not necessarily a small one, could be concealed in every one. He was sure that thought had entered Vann Shatrak’s mind. They were armed, not with dress-daggers, but with swords; long, straight cross-hilted broadswords. They were the first actual swords he had ever seen, except in museums or on the stage.</p>
			<p>There was a bench of gold and onyx at the front, where, normally the seven-man Presidium sat, and in front of it were thronelike seats for the Chiefs of Managements, equivalent to the Imperial Council of Ministers. Because of the projection screen that had been installed, they had all been moved to an improvised dais on the left. There was another dais on the right, under a canopy of black and gold velvet, emblazoned with the gold sun and superimposed black cogwheel of the Empire. There were three thrones, for himself, Shatrak, and Erskyll, and a number of lesser but still imposing chairs for their staffs.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They took their seats. He slipped the earplug of his memophone into his left ear and pressed the stud in the middle of his Grand Star of the Order of Odin. The memophone began giving him the names of the Presidium and of the Chiefs of Managements. He wondered how many upper-slaves had been gunbutted to produce them.</p>
			<p>“Lords and Gentlemen,” he said, after he had greeted them and introduced himself and the others, “I speak to you in the name of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. His Majesty will now greet you in his own voice, by recording.”</p>
			<p>He pressed a button on the arm of his chair. The screen lighted, flickered, and steadied, and the trumpets blared again. When the fanfare ended, a voice thundered:</p>
			<p>“<em>The Emperor speaks!</em>”</p>
			<p>Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> compromised on the beard question with a small mustache. He wore the stern but kindly expression the best theatrical directors in Asgard had taught him; Public Face Number Three. He inclined his head slightly and stiffly, as a man wearing a seven-pound crown must.</p>
			<p>“We greet our subjects of Aditya to the fellowship of the Empire. We have long had good reports of you, and we are happy now to speak to you. Deserve well of us, and prosper under the Sun and Cogwheel.”</p>
			<p>Another fanfare, as the image vanished. Before any of the Lords-Master could find voice, he was speaking to them:</p>
			<p>“Well, Lords and Gentlemen, you have been welcomed into the Empire by his Majesty. I know, there hasn’t been a ship in or out of this system for five centuries, and I suppose you have a great many questions to ask about the Galactic Empire. Members of the Presidium and Chiefs of Managements may address me directly; others will please address the chairman.”</p>
			<p>Olvir Nikkolon, the owner of Tchall Hozhet, was on his feet at once. He had a loose-lipped mouth and a not entirely straight nose and pale eyes that were never entirely still.</p>
			<p>“What I want to know is; why did you people have to come here to take our planet away from us? Isn’t the rest of the Galaxy big enough for you?”</p>
			<p>“No, Lord Nikkolon. The Galaxy is not big enough for any competition of sovereignty. There must be one and only one completely sovereign power. The Terran Federation was once such a power. It failed, and vanished; you know what followed. Darkness and anarchy. We are clawing our way up out of that darkness. We will not fail. We will create a peaceful and unified Galaxy.”</p>
			<p>He talked to them, about the collapse of the old Federation, about the interstellar wars, about the Neobarbarians, about the long night. He told them how the Empire had risen on a few planets five thousand light-years away, and how it had spread.</p>
			<p>“We will not repeat the mistakes of the Terran Federation. We will not attempt to force every planetary government into a common pattern, or dictate the ways in which they govern themselves. We will foster in every way peaceful trade and communication. But we will not again permit the plague of competing sovereignties, the condition under which war is inevitable. The first attempt to set up such a sovereignty in competition with the Empire will be crushed mercilessly, and no planet inhabited by any sapient race will be permitted to remain outside the Empire.</p>
			<p>“Lords and Gentlemen, permit me to show you a little of what we have already accomplished, in the past three hundred years.”</p>
			<p>He pressed another button. The screen flickered, and the show started. It lasted for almost two hours; he used a handphone to interject comments and explanations. He showed them planet after planet⁠—Marduk, where the Empire had begun, Baldur, Vishnu, Belphegor, Morglay, whence their ancestors had come, Amaterasu, Irminsul, Fafnir, finally Odin, the Imperial Planet. He showed towering cities swarming with aircars; spaceports where the huge globes of interstellar ships landed and lifted out; farms and industries; vast crowds at public celebrations; troop-reviews and naval bases and fleet-maneuvers; historical views of the battles that had created Imperial power.</p>
			<p>“That, Lords and Gentlemen, is what you have an opportunity to bring your planet into. If you accept, you will continue to rule Aditya under the Empire. If you refuse, you will only put us to the inconvenience of replacing you with a new planetary government, which will be annoying for us and, probably, fatal for you.”</p>
			<p>Nobody said anything for a few minutes. Then Rovard Javasan, the Chief of Administration and the owner of the mountainous Khreggor Chmidd, rose.</p>
			<p>“Lords and Gentlemen, we cannot resist anything like this,” he said. “We cannot even resist the force they have here; that was tried yesterday, and you all saw what happened. Now, Prince Trevannion; just to what extent will the Mastership retain its sovereignty under the Empire?”</p>
			<p>“To practically the same extent as at present. You will, of course, acknowledge the Emperor as your supreme ruler, and will govern subject to the Imperial Constitution. Have you any colonies on any of the other planets of this system?”</p>
			<p>“We had a shipyard and docks on the inner moon, and we had mines on the fourth planet of this system, but it is almost airless and the colony was limited to a couple of dome-cities. Both were abandoned years ago.”</p>
			<p>“Both will be reopened before long, I daresay. We’d better make the limits of your sovereignty the orbit of the outer planet of this system. You may have your own normal-space ships, but the Empire will control all hyperdrive craft, and all nuclear weapons. I take it you are the sole government on this planet? Then no other will be permitted to compete with you.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what are they taking away from us, then?” somebody in the rear asked.</p>
			<p>“I assume that you are agreed to accept the sovereignty of his Imperial Majesty? Good. As a matter of form, Lord Nikkolon, will you take a vote? His Imperial Majesty would be most gratified if it were unanimous.”</p>
			<p>Somebody insisted that the question would have to be debated, which meant that everybody would have to make a speech, all two thousand of them. He informed them that there was nothing to debate; they were confronted with an accomplished fact which they must accept. So Nikkolon made a speech, telling them at what a great moment in Adityan history they stood, and concluded by saying:</p>
			<p>“I take it that it is the unanimous will of this Convocation that the sovereignty of the Galactic Emperor be acknowledged, and that we, the ‘Mastership of Aditya’ do here proclaim our loyal allegiance to his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik the Third. Any dissent? Then it is ordered so recorded.”</p>
			<p>Then he had to make another speech, to inform the representatives of his new sovereign of the fact. Prince Trevannion, in the name of the Emperor, delivered the well-worn words of welcome, and Lanze Degbrend got the coronet out of the black velvet bag under his arm and the Imperial Proconsul, Obray, Count Erskyll, was crowned. Erskyll’s charge-d’affaires, Sharll Ernanday, produced the scroll of the Imperial Constitution, and Erskyll began to read.</p>
			<p>Section One: The universality of the Empire. The absolute powers of the Emperor. The rules of succession. The Emperor also to be Planetary King of Odin.</p>
			<p>Section Two: Every planetary government to be sovereign in its own internal affairs.⁠ ⁠… Only one sovereign government upon any planet, or within normal-space travel distance.⁠ ⁠… All hyperspace ships, and all nuclear weapons.⁠ ⁠… No planetary government shall make war⁠ ⁠… enter into any alliance⁠ ⁠… tax, regulate or restrain interstellar trade or communication.⁠ ⁠… Every sapient being shall be equally protected.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Then he came to Article Six. He cleared his throat, raised his voice, and read:</p>
			<p>“<q>There shall be no chattel-slavery or serfdom anywhere in the Empire; no sapient being, of any race whatsoever, shall be the property of any being but himself.</q>”</p>
			<p>The Convocation Chamber was silent, like a bomb with a defective fuse, for all of thirty seconds. Then it blew up with a roar. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw the doors slide apart and an airjeep, bristling with machine guns, float in and rise to the ceiling. The first inarticulate roar was followed by a babel of voices, like a tropical cloudburst on a prefab hut. Olvir Nikkolon’s mouth was working as he shouted unheard.</p>
			<p>He pressed another of the row of buttons on the arm of his chair. Out of the screen-speaker a voice, as loud, by actual sound-meter test, as an anti-vehicle gun, thundered:</p>
			<p>“<strong>Silence!</strong>”</p>
			<p>Into the shocked stillness which it produced, he spoke, like a schoolmaster who has returned to find his room in an uproar:</p>
			<p>“Lord Nikkolon; what is this nonsense? You are Chairman of the Presidium; is this how you keep order here? What is this, a planetary parliament or a spaceport saloon?”</p>
			<p>“You tricked us!” Nikkolon accused. “You didn’t tell us about that article when we voted. Why, our whole society is based on slavery!”</p>
			<p>Other voices joined in:</p>
			<p>“That’s all right for you people, you have robots.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Maybe you don’t know it, but there are twenty million slaves on this planet.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Look, you can’t free slaves! That’s ridiculous. A slave’s a <em>slave</em>!”</p>
			<p>“Who’ll do the work? And who would they belong to? They’d have to belong to somebody!”</p>
			<p>“What I want to know,” Rovard Javasan made himself heard, is, “<em>how</em> are you going to free them?”</p>
			<p>There was an ancient word, originating in one of the lost languages of Pre-Atomic Terra⁠—<q>sixtifor</q>. It meant, the basic, fundamental, question. Rovard Javasan, he suspected, had just asked the sixtifor. Of course, Obray, Count Erskyll, Planetary Proconsul of Aditya, didn’t realize that. He didn’t even know what Javasan meant. Just free them. Commodore Vann Shatrak couldn’t see much of a problem, either. He would have answered, Just free them, and then shoot down the first two or three thousand who took it seriously. Jurgen, Prince Trevannion, had no intention whatever of attempting to answer the sixtifor.</p>
			<p>“My dear Lord Javasan, that is the problem of the Adityan Mastership. They are your slaves; we have neither the intention nor the right to free them. But let me remind you that slavery is specifically prohibited by the Imperial Constitution; if you do not abolish it immediately, the Empire will be forced to intervene. I believe, toward the last of those audiovisuals, you saw some examples of Imperial intervention.”</p>
			<p>They had. A few looked apprehensively at the ceiling, as though expecting the hellburners and planet-busters and nega-matter-bombs at any moment. Then one of the members among the benches rose.</p>
			<p>“We don’t know how we are going to do it, Prince Trevannion,” he said. “We will do it, since this is the Empire law, but you will have to tell us how.”</p>
			<p>“Well, the first thing will have to be an Act of Convocation, outlawing the ownership of one being by another. Set some definite date on which the slaves must all be freed; that need not be too immediate. Then, I would suggest that you set up some agency to handle all the details. And, as soon as you have enacted the abolition of slavery, which should be this afternoon, appoint a committee, say a dozen of you, to confer with Count Erskyll and myself. Say you have your committee aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i> in six hours. We’ll have transportation arranged by then. And let me point out, I hope for the last time, that we discuss matters directly, without intermediaries. We don’t want any more slaves, pardon, freedmen, coming aboard to talk for you, as happened yesterday.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Obray, Count Erskyll, was unhappy about it. He did not think that the Lords-Master were to be trusted to abolish slavery; he said so, on the launch, returning to the ship. Jurgen, Prince Trevannion was inclined to agree. He doubted if any of the Lords-Master he had seen were to be trusted, unassisted, to fix a broken mousetrap.</p>
			<p>Line-Commodore Vann Shatrak was also worried. He was wondering how long it would take for Pyairr Ravney to make useful troops out of the newly-surrendered slave soldiers, and where he was going to find contragravity to shift them expeditiously from trouble-spot to trouble-spot. Erskyll thought he was anticipating resistance on the part of the Masters, and for once he approved the use of force. Ordinarily, force was a Bad Thing, but this was a Good Cause, which justified any means.</p>
			<p>They entertained the committee from the Convocation for dinner, that evening. They came aboard stiffly hostile⁠—most understandably so, under the circumstances⁠—and Prince Trevannion exerted all his copious charm to thaw them out, beginning with the pre-dinner cocktails and continuing through the meal. By the time they retired for coffee and brandy to the parlor where the conference was to be held, the Lords-ex-Masters were almost friendly.</p>
			<p>“We’ve enacted the Emancipation Act,” Olvir Nikkolon, who was ex officio chairman of the committee, reported. “Every slave on the planet must be free before the opening of the next Midyear Feasts.”</p>
			<p>“And when will that be?”</p>
			<p>Aditya, he knew, had a three hundred and fifty-eight day year; even if the Midyear Feasts were just past, they were giving themselves very little time. In about a hundred and fifty days, Nikkolon said.</p>
			<p>“Good heavens!” Erskyll began, indignantly.</p>
			<p>“I should say so, myself,” he put in, cutting off anything else the new Proconsul might have said. “You gentlemen are allowing yourselves dangerously little time. A hundred and fifty days will pass quite rapidly, and you have twenty million slaves to deal with. If you start at this moment and work continuously, you’ll have a little under a second apiece for each slave.”</p>
			<p>The Lords-Master looked dismayed. So, he was happy to observe, did Count Erskyll.</p>
			<p>“I assume you have some system of slave registration?” he continued.</p>
			<p>That was safe. They had a bureaucracy, and bureaucracies tend to have registrations of practically everything.</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, of course,” Rovard Javasan assured him. “That’s your Management, isn’t it, Sesar; Servile Affairs?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, we have complete data on every slave on the planet,” Sesar Martwynn, the Chief of Servile Management, said. “Of course, I’d have to ask Zhorzh about the details.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Zhorzh was Zhorzh Khouzhik, Martwynn’s chief-slave in office.</p>
			<p>“At least, he was my chief-slave; now you people have taken him away from me. I don’t know what I’m going to do without him. For that matter, I don’t know what poor Zhorzh will do, either.”</p>
			<p>“Have you gentlemen informed your chief-slaves that they are free, yet?”</p>
			<p>Nikkolon and Javasan looked at each other. Sesar Martwynn laughed.</p>
			<p>“They know,” Javasan said. “I must say they are much disturbed.”</p>
			<p>“Well, reassure them, as soon as you’re back at the Citadel,” he told them. “Tell them that while they are now free, they need not leave you unless they so desire; that you will provide for them as before.”</p>
			<p>“You mean, we can keep our chief-slaves?” somebody cried.</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course⁠—chief-freedmen, you’ll have to call them, now. You’ll have to pay them a salary.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“You mean, give them money?” Ranal Valdry, the Lord Provost-Marshal demanded, incredulously. “Pay our own slaves?”</p>
			<p>“You idiot,” somebody told him, “they aren’t our slaves any more. That’s the whole point of this discussion.”</p>
			<p>“But⁠ ⁠… but how can we pay slaves?” one of the committeemen-at-large asked. “Freedmen, I mean?”</p>
			<p>“With money. You do have money, haven’t you?”</p>
			<p>“Of course we have. What do you think we are, savages?”</p>
			<p>“What kind of money?”</p>
			<p>Why, money; what did he think? The unit was the star-piece, the stelly. When he asked to see some of it, they were indignant. Nobody carried money; wasn’t Masterly. A Master never even touched the stuff; that was what slaves were for. He wanted to know how it was secured, and they didn’t know what he meant, and when he tried to explain their incomprehension deepened. It seemed that the Mastership issued money to finance itself, and individual Masters issued money on their personal credit, and it was handled through the Mastership Banks.</p>
			<p>“That’s Fedrig Daffysan’s Management; he isn’t here,” Rovard Javasan said. “I can’t explain it, myself.”</p>
			<p>And without his chief-slave, Fedrig Daffysan probably would not be able to, either.</p>
			<p>“Yes, gentlemen. I understand. You have money. Now, the first thing you will have to do is furnish us with a complete list of all the slave-owners on the planet, and a list of all the slaves held by each. This will be sent back to Odin, and will be the basis for the compensation to be paid for the destruction of your property-rights in these slaves. How much is a slave worth, by the way?”</p>
			<p>Nobody knew. Slaves were never sold; it wasn’t Masterly to sell one’s slaves. It wasn’t even heard of.</p>
			<p>“Well, we’ll arrive at some valuation. Now, as soon as you get back to the Citadel, talk at once to your former chief-slaves, and their immediate subordinates, and explain the situation to them. This can be passed down through administrative freedmen to the workers; you must see to it that it is clearly understood, at all levels, that as long as the freedmen remain at their work they will be provided for and paid, but that if they quit your service they will receive nothing. Do you think you can do that?”</p>
			<p>“You mean, give them everything we’ve been giving them now, and then pay them money?” Ranal Valdry almost howled.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no. You pay them a fixed wage. You charge them for everything you give them, and deduct that from their wages. It will mean considerable extra bookkeeping, but outside of that I believe you’ll find that things will go along much as they always did.”</p>
			<p>The Masters had begun to relax, and by the time he was finished all of them were smiling in relief. Count Erskyll, on the other hand, was almost writhing in his chair. It must be horrible to be a brilliant young Proconsul of liberal tendencies and to have to sit mute while a cynical old Ministerial Secretary, vastly one’s superior in the Imperial Establishment and a distant cousin of the Emperor to boot, calmly bartered away the sacred liberties of twenty million people.</p>
			<p>“But would that be legal, under the Imperial Constitution?” Olvir Nikkolon asked.</p>
			<p>“I shouldn’t have suggested it if it hadn’t been. The Constitution only forbids physical ownership of one sapient being by another; it emphatically does not guarantee anyone an unearned livelihood.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Convocation committee returned to Zeggensburg to start preparing the servile population for freedom, or reasonable facsimile. The chief-slaves would take care of that; each one seemed to have a list of other chief-slaves, and the word would spread from them on an each-one-call-five system. The public announcement would be postponed until the word could be passed out to the upper servile levels. A meeting with the chief-slaves in office of the various Managements was scheduled for the next afternoon.</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll chatted with forced affability while the departing committeemen were being seen to the launch that would take them down. When the airlock closed behind them, he drew Prince Trevannion aside out of earshot of their subordinates.</p>
			<p>“You know what you’re doing?” he raged, in a hoarse whisper. “You’re simply substituting peonage for outright slavery!”</p>
			<p>“I’d call that something of a step.” He motioned Erskyll into one of the small hall-cars, climbed in beside him, and lifted it, starting toward the living-area. “The Convocation has acknowledged the principle that sapient beings should not be property. That’s a great deal, for one day.”</p>
			<p>“But the people will remain in servitude, you know that. The Masters will keep them in debt, and they’ll be treated just as brutally.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Oh, there will be abuses; that’s to be expected. This Freedmen’s Management, née Servile Management, will have to take care of that. Better make a memo to talk with this chief-freedman of Martwynn’s, what’s his name? Zhorzh Khouzhik; that’s right, let Zhorzh do it. Employment Practices Code, investigation agency, enforcement. If he can’t do the job, that’s not our fault. The Empire does not guarantee every planet an honest, intelligent and efficient government; just a single one.”</p>
			<p>“But.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“It will take two or three generations. At first, the freedmen will be exploited just as they always have been, but in time there will be protests, and disorders, and each time, there will be some small improvement. A society must evolve, Obray. Let these people earn their freedom. Then they will be worthy of it.”</p>
			<p>“They should have their freedom now.”</p>
			<p>“This present generation? What do you think freedom means to them? <q>We don’t have to work, any more.</q> So down tools and let everything stop at once. <q>We can do anything we want to.</q> Let’s kill the overseer. And: <q>Anything that belongs to the Masters belongs to us; we’re Masters too, now.</q> No, I think it’s better, for the present, to tell them that this freedom business is just a lot of Masterly funny-talk, and that things aren’t really being changed at all. It will effect a considerable saving of his Imperial Majesty’s ammunition, for one thing.”</p>
			<p>He dropped Erskyll at his apartment and sent the hall-car back from his own. Lanze Degbrend was waiting for him when he entered.</p>
			<p>“Ravney’s having trouble. That is the word he used,” Degbrend said. In Pyairr Ravney’s lexicon, trouble meant shooting. “The news of the Emancipation Act is leaking all over the place. Some of the troops in the north who haven’t been disarmed yet are mutinying, and there are slave insurrections in a number of places.”</p>
			<p>“They think the Masters have forsaken them, and it’s every slave for himself.” He hadn’t expected that to start so soon. “The announcement had better go out as quickly as possible. And I think we’re going to have some trouble. You have information-taps into Count Erskyll’s numerous staff? Use them as much as you can.”</p>
			<p>“You think he’s going to try to sabotage this employment programme of yours, sir?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, he won’t think of it in those terms. He’ll be preventing me from sabotaging the Emancipation. He doesn’t want to wait three generations; he wants to free them at once. Everything has to be at once for six-month-old puppies, six-year-old children, and reformers of any age.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The announcement did not go out until nearly noon the next day. In terms comprehensible to any low-grade submoron, it was emphasized that all this meant was that slaves should henceforth be called freedmen, that they could have money just like Lords-Master, and that if they worked faithfully and obeyed orders they would be given everything they were now receiving. Ravney had been shuttling troops about, dealing with the sporadic outbreaks of disorder here and there: many of these had been put down, and the rest died out after the telecast explaining the situation.</p>
			<p>In addition, some of Commander Douvrin’s intelligence people had discovered that the only source of fissionables and radioactives for the planet was a complex of uranite mines, separation plants, refineries and reaction-plants on the smaller of Aditya’s two continents, Austragonia. In spite of other urgent calls on his resources, Ravney landed troops to seize these, and a party of engineers followed them down from the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i> to make an inspection.</p>
			<p>At lunch, Count Erskyll was slightly less intransigent on the subject of the wage-employment proposals. No doubt some of his advisors had been telling him what would happen if any appreciable number of Aditya’s labor-force stopped work suddenly, and the wave of uprisings that had broken out before any public announcement had been made puzzled him. He was also concerned about finding a suitable building for a proconsular palace; the business of the Empire on Aditya could not be conducted long from shipboard.</p>
			<p>Going down to the Citadel that afternoon, they found the chief-freedmen of the nonfunctional Chiefs of Management assembled in a large room on the fifth level down. There was a cluster of big tables and communication-screens and wired telephones in the middle, with smaller tables around them, at which freedmen in variously colored gowns sat. The ones at the central tables, a dozen and a half, all wore chief-slaves’ white gowns.</p>
			<p>Trevannion and Erskyll and Patrique Morvill and Lanze Degbrend joined these; subordinates guided the rest of the party⁠—a couple of Ravney’s officers and Erskyll’s numerous staff of advisors and specialists⁠—to distribute themselves with their opposite numbers in the Mastership. Everybody on the Adityan side seemed uneasy with these strange hermaphrodite creatures who were neither slaves nor Lords-Master.</p>
			<p>“Well, gentlemen,” Count Erskyll began, “I suppose you have been informed by your former Lords-Master of how relations between them and you will be in the future?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, Lord Proconsul,” Khreggor Chmidd replied happily. “Everything will be just as before, except that the Lords-Master will be called Lords-Employer, and the slaves will be called freedmen, and any time they want to starve to death, they can leave their Employers if they wish.”</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll frowned. That wasn’t just exactly what he had hoped Emancipation would mean to these people.</p>
			<p>“Nobody seems to understand about this money thing, though,” Zhorzh Khouzhik, Sesar Martwynn’s chief-freedman said. “My Lord-Master⁠—” He slapped himself across the mouth and said, “Lord-Employer!” five times, rapidly. “My Lord-<em>Employer</em> tried to explain it to me, but I don’t think he understands very clearly, himself.”</p>
			<p>“None of them do.”</p>
			<p>The speaker was a small man with pale eyes and a mouth like a rattrap; Yakoop Zhannar, chief-freedman to Ranal Valdry, the Provost-Marshal.</p>
			<p>“Its really your idea, Prince Trevannion,” Erskyll said. “Perhaps you can explain it.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, it’s very simple. You see.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>At least, it had seemed simple when he started. Labor was a commodity, which the worker sold and the employer purchased; a “fair wage” was one which enabled both to operate at a profit. Everybody knew that⁠—except here on Aditya. On Aditya, a slave worked because he was a slave, and a Master provided for him because he was a Master, and that was all there was to it. But now, it seemed, there weren’t any more Masters, and there weren’t any more slaves.</p>
			<p>“That’s exactly it,” he replied, when somebody said as much. “So now, if the slaves, I mean, freedmen, want to eat, they have to work to earn money to buy food, and if the Employers want work done, they have to pay people to do it.”</p>
			<p>“Then why go to all the trouble about the money?” That was an elderly chief-freedman, Mykhyl Eschkhaffar, whose Lord-Employer, Oraze Borztall, was Manager of Public Works. “Before your ships came, the slaves worked for the Masters, and the Masters took care of the slaves, and everybody was content. Why not leave it like that?”</p>
			<p>“Because the Galactic Emperor, who is the Lord-Master of these people, says that there must be no more slaves. Don’t ask me why,” Tchall Hozhet snapped at him. “I don’t know, either. But they are here with ships and guns and soldiers; what can we do?”</p>
			<p>“That’s very close to it,” he admitted. “But there is one thing you haven’t considered. A slave only gets what his master gives him. But a free worker for pay gets money which he can spend for whatever he wants, and he can save money, and if he finds that he can make more money working for somebody else, he can quit his employer and get a better job.”</p>
			<p>“We hadn’t thought of that,” Khreggor Chmidd said. “A slave, even a chief-slave, was never allowed to have money of his own, and if he got hold of any, he couldn’t spend it. But now.⁠ ⁠…” A glorious vista seemed to open in front of him. “And he can accumulate money. I don’t suppose a common worker could, but an upper slave.⁠ ⁠… Especially a chief-slave.⁠ ⁠…” He slapped his mouth, and said, “Freedman!” five times.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Khreggor.” That was Ridgerd Schferts (Fedrig Daffysan; Fiscal Management). “I am sure we could all make quite a lot of money, now that we are freedmen.”</p>
			<p>Some of them were briefly puzzled; gradually, comprehension dawned. Obray, Count Erskyll, looked distressed; he seemed to be hoping, vainly, that they weren’t thinking of what he suspected they were.</p>
			<p>“How about the Mastership freedmen?” another asked. “We, here, will be paid by our Lords-Mas.⁠ ⁠… Lords-Employer. But everybody from the green robes down were provided for by the Mastership. Who will pay them, now?”</p>
			<p>“Why, the Mastership, of course,” Ridgerd Schferts said. “My Management⁠—my Lord-Employer’s, I mean⁠—will issue the money to pay them.”</p>
			<p>“You may need a new printing-press,” Lanze Degbrend said. “And an awful lot of paper.”</p>
			<p>“This planet will need currency acceptable in interstellar trade,” Erskyll said.</p>
			<p>Everybody looked blankly at him. He changed the subject:</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Chmidd, could you or <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hozhet tell me what kind of a constitution the Mastership has?”</p>
			<p>“You mean, like the paper you read in the Convocation?” Hozhet asked. “Oh, there is nothing at all like that. The former Lords-Master simply ruled.”</p>
			<p>No. They reigned. This servile <q>tammanihal</q>⁠—another ancient Terran word, of uncertain origin⁠—ruled.</p>
			<p>“Well, how is the Mastership organized, then?” Erskyll persisted. “How did the Lord Nikkolon get to be Chairman of the Presidium, and the Lord Javasan to be Chief of Administration?”</p>
			<p>That was very simple. The Convocation, consisting of the heads of all the Masterly families, actually small clans, numbered about twenty-five hundred. They elected the seven members of the Presidium, who drew lots for the Chairmanship. They served for life. Vacancies were filled by election on nomination of the surviving members. The Presidium appointed the Chiefs of Managements, who also served for life.</p>
			<p>At least, it had stability. It was self-perpetuating.</p>
			<p>“Does the Convocation make the laws?” Erskyll asked.</p>
			<p>Hozhet was perplexed. “<em>Make</em> laws, Lord Proconsul? Oh, no. We have laws.”</p>
			<p>There were planets, here and there through the Empire, where an attitude like that would have been distinctly beneficial; planets with elective parliaments, every member of which felt himself obligated to get as many laws enacted during his term of office as possible.</p>
			<p>“But this is dreadful; you <em>must</em> have a constitution!” Obray of Erskyll was shocked. “We will have to get one drawn up and adopted.”</p>
			<p>“We don’t know anything about that at all,” Khreggor Chmidd admitted. “This is something new. You will have to help us.”</p>
			<p>“I certainly will, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Chmidd. Suppose you form a committee⁠—yourself, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hozhet, and three or four others; select them among yourselves⁠—and we can get together and talk over what will be needed. And another thing. We’ll have to stop calling this the Mastership. There are no more Masters.”</p>
			<p>“The Employership?” Lanze Degbrend deadpanned.</p>
			<p>Erskyll looked at him angrily. “This is something,” he told the chief-freedmen, “that should not belong to the Employers alone. It should belong to everybody. Let us call it the Commonwealth. That means something everybody owns in common.”</p>
			<p>“Something everybody owns, nobody owns,” Mykhyl Eschkhaffar objected.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, Mykhyl; it will belong to everybody,” Khreggor Chmidd told him earnestly. “But somebody will have to take care of it for everybody. That,” he added complacently, “will be you and me and the rest of us here.”</p>
			<p>“I believe,” Yakoop Zhannar said, almost smiling, “that this freedom is going to be a wonderful thing. For us.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t like it!” Mykhyl Eschkhaffar said stubbornly. “Too many new things, and too much changing names. We have to call slaves freedmen; we have to call Lords Master Lords-Employer; we have to call the Management of Servile Affairs the Management for Freedmen. Now we have to call the Mastership this new name, Commonwealth. And all these new things, for which we have no routine procedures and no directives. I wish these people had never heard of this planet.”</p>
			<p>“That makes at least two of us,” Patrique Morvill said, sotto voce.</p>
			<p>“Well, the planetary constitution can wait just a bit,” Prince Trevannion suggested. “We have a great many items on the agenda which must be taken care of immediately. For instance, there’s this thing about finding a proconsular palace.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A surprising amount of work had been done at the small tables where Erskyll’s staff of political and economic and technological experts had been conferring with the subordinate upper-freedmen. It began coming out during the pre-dinner cocktails aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i>, continued through the meal, and was fully detailed during the formal debriefing session afterward.</p>
			<p>Finding a suitable building for the Proconsular Palace would present difficulties. Real estate was not sold on Aditya, any more than slaves were. It was not only un-Masterly but illegal; estates were all entailed and the inalienable property of Masterly families. What was wanted was one of the isolated residential towers in Zeggensburg, far enough from the Citadel to avoid an appearance of too close supervision. The last thing anybody wanted was to establish the Proconsul in the Citadel itself. The Management of Business of the Mastership, however, had promised to do something about it. That would mean, no doubt, that the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i> would be hanging over Zeggensburg, serving as Proconsular Palace, for the next year or so.</p>
			<p>The Servile Management, rechristened Freedmen’s Management, would undertake to safeguard the rights of the newly emancipated slaves. There would be an Employment Code⁠—Count Erskyll was invited to draw that up⁠—and a force of investigators, and an enforcement agency, under Zhorzh Khouzhik.</p>
			<p>One of Commander Douvrin’s men, who had been at the Austragonia nuclear-industries establishment, was present and reported:</p>
			<p>“Great Ghu, you ought to see that place! They’ve people working in places I wouldn’t send an unshielded robot, and the hospital there is bulging with radiation-sickness cases. The equipment must have been brought here by the Space Vikings. What’s left of it is the damnedest mess of goldbergery I ever saw. The whole thing ought to be shut down and completely rebuilt.”</p>
			<p>Erskyll wanted to know who owned it. The Mastership, he was told.</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” one of his economics men agreed. “Management of Public Works.” That would be Mykhyl Eschkhaffar, who had so bitterly objected to the new nomenclature. “If anybody needs fissionables for a power-reactor or radioactives for nuclear-electric conversion, his chief business slave gets what’s needed. Furthermore, doesn’t even have to sign for it.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t they sell it for revenue?”</p>
			<p>“Nifflheim, no! This government doesn’t need revenue. This government supports itself by counterfeiting. When the Mastership needs money, they just have Ridgerd Schferts print up another batch. Like everybody else.”</p>
			<p>“Then the money simply isn’t worth anything!” Erskyll was horrified, which was rapidly becoming his normal state.</p>
			<p>“Who cares about money, Obray,” he said. “Didn’t you hear them, last evening? It’s un-Masterly to bother about things like money. Of course, everybody owes everybody for everything, but it’s all in the family.”</p>
			<p>“Well, something will have to be done about that!”</p>
			<p>That was at least the tenth time he had said that, this evening.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It came practically as a thunderbolt when Khreggor Chmidd screened the ship the next afternoon to report that a Proconsular Palace had been found, and would be ready for occupancy in a day or so. The chief-freedmen of the Management of Business of the Mastership and of the Lord Chief Justiciar had found one, the Elegry Palace, which had been unoccupied except for what he described as a small caretaking staff for years, while two Masterly families disputed inheritance rights and slave lawyers quibbled endlessly before a slave judge. The chief freedman of the Lord Chief Justiciar had simply summoned judge and lawyers into his office and ordered them to settle the suit at once. The settlement had consisted of paying both litigants the full value of the building; this came to fifty million stellies apiece. Arbitrarily, the stelly was assigned a value in Imperial crowns of a hundred for one. A million crowns was about what the building would be worth, with contents, on Odin. It would be paid for with a draft on the Imperial Exchequer.</p>
			<p>“Well, you have some hard currency on the planet, now,” he told Count Erskyll, while they were having a pre-dinner drink together that evening. “I hope it doesn’t touch off an inflation, if the term is permissible when applied to Adityan currency.”</p>
			<p>Erskyll snapped his fingers. “Yes! And there’s the money we’ve been spending for supplies. And when we start compensation payments.⁠ ⁠… Excuse me for a moment.”</p>
			<p>He dashed off, his drink in his hand. After a long interval, he was back, carrying a fresh one he had gotten from a bartending robot en route.</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s taken care of,” he said. “My fiscal man’s getting in touch with Ridgerd Schferts; the Elegry heirs will be paid in Adityan stellies, and the Imperial crowns will be held in the Commonwealth Bank, or, better, banked in Asgard, to give Aditya some off-planet credit. And we’ll do the same with our other expenditures, and with the slave-compensation. This is going to be wonderful; this planet needs everything in the way of industrial equipment; this is how they’re going to get it.”</p>
			<p>“But, Obray; the compensations are owing to the individual Masters. They should be paid in crowns. You know as well as I do that this hundred-for-one rate is purely a local fiction. On the interstellar exchange, these stellies have a crown value of precisely zero-point-zero.”</p>
			<p>“You know what would happen if these ci-devant Masters got hold of Imperial crowns,” Erskyll said. “They’d only squander them back again for useless imported luxuries. This planet needs a complete modernization, and this is the only way the money to pay for it can be gotten.” He was gesturing excitedly with the almost-full glass in his hand; Prince Trevannion stepped back out of the way of the splash he anticipated. “I have no sympathy for these ci-devant Masters. They own every stick and stone and pinch of dust on this planet, as it is. Is that fair?”</p>
			<p>“Possibly not. But neither is what you’re proposing to do.”</p>
			<p>Obray, Count Erskyll, couldn’t see that. He was proposing to secure the Greatest Good for the Greatest Number, and to Nifflheim with any minorities who happened to be in the way.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Navy took over the Elegry Palace the next morning, ran up the Imperial Sun and Cogwheel flag, and began transmitting views of its interior up to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i>. It was considerably smaller than the Imperial Palace at Asgard on Odin, but room for room the furnishings were rather more ornate and expensive. By the next afternoon, the counterespionage team that had gone down reported the Masterly living quarters clear of pickups, microphones, and other apparatus of servile snooping, of which they had found many. The <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Canopus</i> was recalled from her station over the northern end of the continent and began sending down the proconsulate furnishings stowed aboard, including several hundred domestic robots.</p>
			<p>The skeleton caretaking staff Chmidd had mentioned proved to number five hundred.</p>
			<p>“What are we going to do about them?” Erskyll wanted to know. “There’s a limit to the upkeep allowance for a proconsulate, and we can’t pay five hundred useless servants. The chief-freedman, and about a dozen assistants, and a few to operate the robots, when we train them, but five hundred.⁠ ⁠… !”</p>
			<p>“Let Zhorzh do it,” Prince Trevannion suggested. “Isn’t that what this Freedmen’s Management is for; to find employment for emancipated slaves? Just emancipate them and turn them over to Khouzhik.”</p>
			<p>Khouzhik promptly placed all of them on the payroll of his Management. Khouzhik was having his hands full. He had all his top mathematical experts, some of whom even understood the use of the slide-rule, trying to work up a scale of wages. Erskyll loaned him a few of his staff. None of the ideas any of them developed proved workable. Khouzhik had also organized a corps of investigators, and he was beginning to annex the private guard-companies of the Lords-ex-Master, whom he was organizing into a police force.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The nuclear works on Austragonia were closed down. Mykhyl Eschkhaffar ordered a programme of rationing and priorities to conserve the stock of plutonium and radioactive isotopes on hand, and he decided that henceforth nuclear-energy materials would be sold instead of furnished freely. He simply found out what the market quotations on Odin were, translated that into stellies, and adopted it. This was just a base price; there would have to be bribes for priority allocations, rakeoffs for the under-freedmen, and graft for the business-freedmen of the Lords-ex-Masters who bought the stuff. The latter were completely unconcerned; none of them even knew about it.</p>
			<p>The Convocation adjourned until the next regular session, at the Midyear Feasts, an eight-day intercalary period which permitted dividing the 358-day Adityan year into ten months of thirty-five days each. Count Erskyll was satisfied to see them go. He was working on a constitution for the Commonwealth of Aditya, and was making very little progress with it.</p>
			<p>“It’s one of these elaborate check-and-balance things,” Lanze Degbrend reported. “To begin with, it was the constitution of Aton, with an elective president substituted for a hereditary king. Of course, there are a lot of added gadgets; Atonian Radical Democrat stuff. Chmidd and Hozhet and the other chief-slaves don’t like it, either.”</p>
			<p>“Slap your mouth and say, ‘Freedmen,’ five times.”</p>
			<p>“Nuts,” his subordinate retorted insubordinately. “I know a slave when I see one. A slave is a slave, with or without a gorget; if he doesn’t wear it around his neck, he has it tattooed on his soul. It takes at least three generations to rub it off.”</p>
			<p>“I could wish that Count Erskyll.⁠ ⁠…” he began. “What else is our Proconsul doing?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m afraid he’s trying to set up some kind of a scheme for the complete nationalization of all farms, factories, transport facilities, and other means of production and distribution,” Degbrend said.</p>
			<p>“He’s not going to try to do that himself, is he?” He was, he discovered, speaking sharply, and modified his tone. “He won’t do it with Imperial authority, or with Imperial troops. Not as long as I’m here. And when we go back to Odin, I’ll see to it that Vann Shatrak understands that.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no. The Commonwealth of Aditya will do that,” Degbrend said. “Chmidd and Hozhet and Yakoop Zhannar and Zhorzh Khouzhik and the rest of them, that is. He wants it done legitimately and legally. That means, he’ll have to wait till the Midyear Feasts, when the Convocation assembles, and he can get his constitution enacted. If he can get it written by then.”</p>
			<p>Vann Shatrak sent two of the destroyers off to explore the moons of Aditya, of which there were two. The outer moon, Aditya-<i epub:type="z3998:place">Ba’</i>, was an irregular chunk of rock fifty miles in diameter, barely visible to the naked eye. The inner, Aditya-<i epub:type="z3998:place">Alif</i>, however, was an eight-hundred-mile sphere; it had once been the planetary ship-station and shipyard-base. It seemed to have been abandoned when the Adityan technology and economy had begun sagging under the weight of the slave system. Most of the installations remained, badly run down but repairable. Shatrak transferred as many of his technicians as he could spare to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Mizar</i> and sent her to recondition the shipyard and render the underground city inhabitable again so that the satellite could be used as a base for his ships. He decided, then, to send the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irma</i> back to Odin with reports of the annexation of Aditya, a proposal that Aditya-<i epub:type="z3998:place">Alif</i> be made a permanent Imperial naval-base, and a request for more troops.</p>
			<p>Prince Trevannion taped up his own reports, describing the general situation on the newly annexed planet, and doing nothing to minimize the problems facing its Proconsul.</p>
			<p>“Count Erskyll” he finished, “is doing the best possible under circumstances from which I myself would feel inclined to shrink. If not carried to excess, perhaps youthful idealism is not without value in Empire statecraft. I understand that Commodore Shatrak, who is also coping with some very trying problems, is requesting troop reinforcements. I believe this request amply justified, and would recommend that they be gotten here as speedily as possible.</p>
			<p>“I understand that he is also recommending a permanent naval base on the larger of this planet’s two satellites. This I also endorse unreservedly. It would have a most salutary effect on the local government. I would further recommend that Commodore Shatrak be placed in command of it, with suitable promotion, which he has long ago earned.”</p>
			<p>Erskyll was surprised that he was not himself returning to Odin on the destroyer, and evidently disturbed. He mentioned it during pre-dinner cocktails that evening.</p>
			<p>“I know, my own work here is finished; was the moment the Convocation voted acknowledgment of Imperial rule.” Prince Trevannion replied. “I would like to stay on for the Midyear Feasts, though. The Convocation will vote on your constitution, and I would like to be able to report their action to the Prime Minister. How is it progressing, by the way?”</p>
			<p>“Well, we have a rough draft. I don’t care much for it, myself, but Citizen Hozhet and Citizen Chmidd and Citizen Zhannar and the others are most enthusiastic, and, after all, they are the ones who will have to operate under it.”</p>
			<p>The Masterly estates would be the representative units; from each, the freedmen would elect representatives to regional elective councils, and these in turn would elect representatives to a central electoral council which would elect a Supreme People’s Legislative Council. This would not only function as the legislative body, but would also elect a Manager-in-Chief, who would appoint the Chiefs of Management, who, in turn, would appoint their own subordinates.</p>
			<p>“I don’t like it, myself,” Erskyll said. “It’s not democratic enough. There should be a direct vote by the people. Well,” he grudged, “I suppose it will take a little time for them to learn democracy.” This was the first time he had come out and admitted that. “There is to be a Constituent Convention in five years, to draw up a new constitution.”</p>
			<p>“How about the Convocation? You don’t expect them to vote themselves out of existence, do you?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, we’re keeping the Convocation, in the present constitution, but they won’t have any power. Five years from now, we’ll be rid of them entirely. Look here; you’re not going to work against this, are you? You won’t advise these ci-devant Lords-Master to vote against it, when it comes up?”</p>
			<p>“Certainly not. I think your constitution⁠—Khreggor Chmidd’s and Tchall Hozhet’s, to be exact⁠—will be nothing short of a political disaster, but it will insure some political stability, which is all that matters from the Imperial point of view. An Empire statesman must always guard against sympathizing with local factions and interests, and I can think of no planet on which I could be safer from any such temptation. If these Lords-Master want to vote their throats cut, and the slaves want to re-enslave themselves, they may all do so with my complete blessing.”</p>
			<p>If he had been at all given to dramatic gestures he would then have sent for water and washed his hands.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Metaphorically, he did so at that moment; thereafter his interest in Adityan affairs was that of a spectator at a boring and stupid show, watching only because there is nothing else to watch, and wishing that it had been possible to have returned to Odin on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irma</i>. The Prime Minister, however, was entitled to a full and impartial report, which he would scarcely get from Count Erskyll, on this new jewel in the Imperial Crown. To be able to furnish that, he would have to remain until the Midyear Feasts, when the Convocation would act on the new constitution. Whether the constitution was adopted or rejected was, in itself, unimportant; in either case, Aditya would have a government recognizable as such by the Empire, which was already recognizing some fairly unlikely-looking governments. In either case, too, Aditya would make nobody on any other planet any trouble. It wouldn’t have, at least for a long time, even if it had been left unannexed, but no planet inhabited by Terro-humans could be trusted to remain permanently peaceful and isolated. There is a spark of aggressive ambition in every Terro-human people, no matter how debased, which may smoulder for centuries or even millennia and then burst, fanned by some random wind, into flame. To shift the metaphor slightly, the Empire could afford to leave no unwatched pots around to boil over unexpectedly.</p>
			<p>Occasionally, he did warn young Erskyll of the dangers of overwork and emotional over-involvement. Each time, the Proconsul would pour out some tale of bickering and rivalry among the chief-freedmen of the Managements. Citizen Khouzhik and Citizen Eschkhaffar⁠—they were all calling each other Citizen, now⁠—were contesting overlapping jurisdictions. Khouzhik wanted to change the name of his Management⁠—he no longer bothered mentioning Sesar Martwynn⁠—to Labor and Industry. To this, Mykhyl Eschkhaffar objected vehemently; any Industry that was going to be managed would be managed by his⁠—Oraze Borztall was similarly left unmentioned⁠—management of Public Works. And they were also feuding about the robotic and remote-controlled equipment that had been sent down from the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i> to the Austragonia nuclear-power works.</p>
			<p>Khouzhik was also in controversy with Yakoop Zhannar, who was already calling himself People’s Provost-Marshal. Khouzhik had taken over all the private armed-guards on the Masterly farms and in the factories, and assimilated them into something he was calling the People’s Labor Police, ostensibly to enforce the new Code of Employment Practice. Zhannar insisted that they should be under his Management; when Chmidd and Hozhet supported Khouzhik, he began clamoring for the return of the regular army to his control.</p>
			<p>Commodore Shatrak was more than glad to get rid of the Adityan army, and so was Pyairr Ravney, who was in immediate command of them. The Adityans didn’t care one way or the other. Zhannar was delighted, and so were Chmidd and Hozhet. So, oddly, was Zhorzh Khouzhik. At the same time, the state of martial law proclaimed on the day of the landing was terminated.</p>
			<p>The days slipped by. There were entertainments at the new Proconsular Palace for the Masterly residents of Zeggensburg, and Erskyll and his staff were entertained at Masterly palaces. The latter affairs pained Prince Trevannion excessively⁠—hours on end of gorging uninspired cooking and guzzling too-sweet wine and watching ex-slave performers whose acts were either brutal or obscene and frequently both, and, more unforgivable, stupidly so. The Masterly conversation was simply stupid.</p>
			<p>He borrowed a reconn-car from Ravney; he and Lanze Degbrend and, usually, one or another of Ravney’s young officers, took long trips of exploration. They fished in mountain streams, and hunted the small deerlike game, and he found himself enjoying these excursions more than anything he had done in recent years; certainly anything since Aditya had come into the viewscreens of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i>. Once in a while, they claimed and received Masterly hospitality at some large farming estate. They were always greeted with fulsome cordiality, and there was always surprise that persons of their rank and consequence should travel unaccompanied by a retinue of servants.</p>
			<p>He found things the same wherever he stopped. None of the farms were producing more than a quarter of the potential yield per acre, and all depleting the soil outrageously. Ten slaves⁠—he didn’t bother to think of them as freedmen⁠—doing the work of one, and a hundred of them taking all day to do what one robot would have done before noon. White-gowned chief-slaves lording it over green and orange gowned supervisors and clerks; overseers still carrying and frequently using whips and knouts and sandbag flails.</p>
			<p>Once or twice, when a Masterly back was turned, he caught a look of murderous hatred flickering into the eyes of some upper-slave. Once or twice, when a Master thought his was turned, he caught the same look in Masterly eyes, directed at him or at Lanze.</p>
			<p>The Midyear Feasts approached; each time he returned to the city he found more excitement as preparations went on. Mykhyl Eschkhaffar’s Management of Public Works was giving top priority to redecorating the Convocation Chamber and the lounges and dining-rooms around it in which the Masters would relax during recesses. More and more Masterly families flocked in from outlying estates, with contragravity-flotillas and retinues of attendants, to be entertained at the city palaces. There were more and gaudier banquets and balls and entertainments. By the time the Feasts began, every Masterly man, woman and child would be in the city.</p>
			<p>There were long columns of military contragravity coming in, too; troop-carriers and combat-vehicles. Yakoop Zhannar was bringing in all his newly recovered army, and Zhorzh Khouzhik his newly organized People’s Labor Police. Vann Shatrak, who was now commanding his battle-line unit by screen from the Proconsular Palace, began fretting.</p>
			<p>“I wish I hadn’t been in such a hurry to terminate martial rule,” he said, once. “And I wish Pyairr hadn’t been so confoundedly efficient in retraining those troops. That may cost us a few extra casualties, before we’re through.”</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll laughed at his worries.</p>
			<p>“It’s just this rivalry between Citizen Khouzhik and Citizen Zhannar,” he said, “They’re like a couple of ci-devant Lords-Master competing to give more extravagant feasts. Zhannar’s going to hold a review of his troops, and of course, Khouzhik intends to hold a review of his police. That’s all there is to it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, just the same, I wish some reinforcements would get here from Odin,” Shatrak said.</p>
			<p>Erskyll was busy, in the days before the Midyear Feasts, either conferring at the Citadel with the ex-slaves who were the functional heads of the Managements or at the Proconsular Palace with Hozhet and Chmidd and the chief-freedmen of the influential Convocation leaders and Presidium members. Everybody was extremely optimistic about the constitution.</p>
			<p>He couldn’t quite understand the optimism, himself.</p>
			<p>“If I were one of these Lords-Master, I wouldn’t even consider the thing,” he told Erskyll. “I know, they’re stupid, but I can’t believe they’re stupid enough to commit suicide, and that’s what this amounts to.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it does,” Erskyll agreed, cheerfully. “As soon as they enact it, they’ll be of no more consequence than the Assemblage of Peers on Aton; they’ll have no voice in the operation of the Commonwealth, and none in the new constitution that will be drawn up five years from now. And that will be the end of them. All the big estates, and the factories and mines and contragravity-ship lines will be nationalized.”</p>
			<p>“And they’ll have nothing at all, except a hamper-full of repudiated paper stellies,” he finished. “That’s what I mean. What makes you think they’ll be willing to vote for that?”</p>
			<p>“They don’t know they’re voting for it. They’ll think they’re voting to keep control of the Mastership. People like Olvir Nikkolon and Rovard Javasan and Ranal Valdry and Sesar Martwynn think they still own their chief-freedmen; they think Hozhet and Chmidd and Zhannar and Khouzhik will do exactly what they tell them. And they believe anything the Hozhets and Chmidds and Zhannars tell them. And every chief-freedman is telling his Lord-Employer that the only way they can keep control is by adopting the constitution; that they can control the elections on their estates, and hand-pick the People’s Legislative Council. I tell you, Prince Trevannion, the constitution is as good as enacted.”</p>
			<p>Two days before the opening of the Convocation, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irma</i> came into radio-range, five light-hours away, and began transmitting in taped matter at sixty-speed. Erskyll’s report and his own acknowledged; a routine “well done” for the successful annexation. Commendation for Shatrak’s handling of the landing operation. Orders to take over Aditya-<i epub:type="z3998:place">Alif</i> and begin construction of a permanent naval base. Notification of promotion to base-admiral, and blank commission as line-commodore; that would be Patrique Morvill. And advice that one transport-cruiser, <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Algol</i>, with an Army contragravity brigade aboard, and two engineering ships, would leave Odin for Aditya in fifteen days. The last two words erased much of the new base-admiral’s pleasure.</p>
			<p>“Fifteen days, great Ghu! And those tubs won’t make near the speed of <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Irma</i>, getting here. We’ll be lucky to see them in twenty. And Beelzebub only knows what’ll be going on here then.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Four times, the big screen failed to respond. They were all crowded into one of the executive conference-rooms at the Proconsular Palace, the batteries of communication and recording equipment incongruously functional among the gold-encrusted luxury of the original Masterly furnishings. Shatrak swore.</p>
			<p>“Andrey, I thought your people had planted those pickups where they couldn’t be found,” he said to Commander Douvrin.</p>
			<p>“There is no such place, sir,” the intelligence officer replied. “Just places where things are hard to find.”</p>
			<p>“Did you mention our pickups to Chmidd or Hozhet or any of the rest of the shaveheads?” Shatrak asked Erskyll.</p>
			<p>“No. I didn’t even know where they were. And it was the freedmen who found them,” Erskyll said. “I don’t know why they wouldn’t want us looking in.”</p>
			<p>Lanze Degbrend, at the screen, twisted the dial again, and this time the screen flickered and cleared, and they were looking into the Convocation Chamber from the extreme rear, above the double doors. Far away, in front, Olvir Nikkolon was rising behind the gold and onyx bench, and from the speaker the call bell tolled slowly, and the buzz of over two thousand whispering voices diminished. Nikkolon began to speak:</p>
			<p>“Seven and a half centuries ago, our fathers went forth from Morglay to plant upon this planet a new banner.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>It was evidently a set speech, one he had recited year after year, and every Lord Chairman of the Presidium before him. The splendid traditions. The glories of the Masterly race. The all-conquering Space Vikings. The proud heritage of the Sword-Worlds. Lanze was fiddling with the control knobs, stepping up magnification and focusing on the speaker’s head and shoulders. Then everybody laughed; Nikkolon had a small plug in one ear, with a fine wire running down to vanish under his collar. Degbrend brought back the full view of the Convocation Chamber.</p>
			<p>Nikkolon went on and on. Vann Shatrak summoned a robot to furnish him with a cold beer and another cigar. Erskyll was drumming an impatient devil’s tattoo with his fingernails on the gold-encrusted table in front of him. Lanze Degbrend began interpolating sarcastic comments. And finally, Pyairr Ravney, who came from Lugaluru, reverted to the idiom of his planet’s favorite sport:</p>
			<p>“Come on, come on; turn out the bull! What’s the matter, is the gate stuck?”</p>
			<p>If so, it came quickly unstuck, and the bull emerged, pawing and snorting.</p>
			<p>“This year, other conquerors have come to Aditya, here to plant another banner, the Sun and Cogwheel of the Galactic Empire, and I blush to say it, we are as helpless against these conquerors as were the miserable barbarians and their wretched serfs whom our fathers conquered seven hundred and sixty-two years ago, whose descendants, until this black day, had been our slaves.”</p>
			<p>He continued, his voice growing more impassioned and more belligerent. Count Erskyll fidgeted. This wasn’t the way the Chmidd-Hozhet Constitution ought to be introduced.</p>
			<p>“So, perforce, we accepted the sovereignty of this alien Empire. We are now the subjects of his Imperial Majesty, Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. We must govern Aditya subject to the Imperial Constitution.” (Groans, boos; catcalls, if the Adityan equivalent of cats made noises like that.) “At one stroke, this Constitution has abolished our peculiar institution, upon which is based our entire social structure. This I know. But this same Imperial Constitution is a collapsium-strong shielding; let me call your attention to Article One, Section Two: <q>Every Empire planet shall be self-governed as to its own affairs, in the manner of its own choice and without interference.</q> Mark this well, for it is our guarantee that this government, of the Masters, by the Masters, and for the Masters, shall not perish from Aditya.” (Prolonged cheering.)</p>
			<p>“Now, these arrogant conquerors have overstepped their own supreme law. They have written for this Mastership a constitution, designed for the sole purpose of accomplishing the liquidation of the Masterly class and race. They have endeavored to force this planetary constitution upon us by threats of force, and by a shameful attempt to pervert the fidelity of our chief-slaves⁠—I will not insult these loyal servitors with this disgusting new name, freedmen⁠—so that we might, a second time, be tricked into voting assent to our own undoing. But in this, they have failed. Our chief-slaves have warned us of the trap concealed in this constitution written by the Proconsul, Count Erskyll. My faithful Tchall Hozhet has shown me all the pitfalls in this infamous document.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Obray, Count Erskyll, was staring in dismay at the screen. Then he began cursing blasphemously, the first time he had ever been heard to do so, and, as he was at least nominally a Pantheist, this meant blaspheming the entire infinite universe.</p>
			<p>“The rats! The dirty treacherous rats! We came here to help them, and look; they’ve betrayed us.⁠ ⁠… !” He lost his voice in a wheezing sob, and then asked: “Why did they do it? Do they want to go on being slaves?”</p>
			<p>Perhaps they did. It wasn’t for love of their Lords-Master; he was sure of that. Even from the beginning, they had found it impossible to disguise their contempt.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Then he saw Olvir Nikkolon stop short and thrust out his arm, pointing directly below the pickup, and as he watched, something green-gray, a remote-control contragravity lorry, came floating into the field of the screen. One of the vehicles that had been sent down from the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i> for use at the uranium mines. As it lifted and advanced toward the center of the room, the other Lords-Master were springing to their feet.</p>
			<p>Vann Shatrak also sprang to his feet, reaching the controls of the screen and cutting the sound. He was just in time to save them from being, at least temporarily, deafened, for no sooner had he silenced the speaker than the lorry vanished in a flash that filled the entire room.</p>
			<p>When the dazzle left their eyes, and the smoke and dust began to clear, they saw the Convocation Chamber in wreckage, showers of plaster and bits of plastiboard still falling from above. The gold and onyx bench was broken in a number of places; the Chiefs of Management in front of it, and the Presidium above, had vanished. Among the benches lay black-clad bodies, a few still moving. Smoke rose from burning clothing. Admiral Shatrak put on the sound again; from the screen came screams and cries of pain and fright.</p>
			<p>Then the doors on the two long sides opened, and red-brown uniforms appeared. The soldiers advanced into the Chamber, unslinging rifles and submachine guns. Unheeding the still falling plaster, they moved forward, firing as they came. A few of them slung their firearms and picked up Masterly dress swords, using them to finish the wounded among the benches. The screams grew fewer, and then stopped.</p>
			<p>Count Erskyll sat frozen, staring white-faced and horror-sick into the screen. Some of the others had begun to recover and were babbling excitedly. Vann Shatrak was at a communication-screen, talking to Commodore Patrique Morvill, aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i>:</p>
			<p>“All the Landing-Troops, and all the crewmen you can spare and arm. And every vehicle you have. This is only the start of it; there’ll be a general massacre of Masters next. I don’t doubt it’s started already.”</p>
			<p>At another screen, Pyairr Ravney was saying, to the officer of the day of the Palace Guard: “No, there’s no telling what they’ll do next. Whatever it is, be ready for it ten minutes ago.”</p>
			<p>He stubbed out his cigarette and rose, and as he did, Erskyll came out of his daze and onto his feet.</p>
			<p>“Commodore Shatrak! I mean, Admiral,” he corrected himself. “We must reimpose martial rule. I wish I’d never talked you into terminating it. Look at that!” He pointed at the screen; big dump-lorries were already coming in the doors under the pickup, with a mob of gowned civil-service people crowding in under them. They and the soldiers began dragging bodies out from among the seats to be loaded and hauled away. “There’s the planetary government, murdered to the last man!”</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid we can’t do anything like that,” he said. “This seems to be a simple transfer of power by coup-d’etat; rather more extreme than usual, but normal political practice on this sort of planet. The Empire has no right to interfere.”</p>
			<p>Erskyll turned on him indignantly. “But it’s mass murder!”</p>
			<p>“It’s an accomplished fact. Whoever ordered this, Citizen Chmidd and Citizen Hozhet and Citizen Zhannar and the rest of your good democratic citizens, are now the planetary government of Aditya. As long as they don’t attack us, or repudiate the sovereignty of the Emperor, you’ll have to recognize them as such.”</p>
			<p>“A bloody-handed gang of murderers; recognize them?”</p>
			<p>“All governments have a little blood here and there on their hands; you’ve seen this by screen instead of reading about it in a history book, but that shouldn’t make any difference. And you’ve said, yourself, that the Masters would have to be eliminated. You’ve told Chmidd and Hozhet and the others that, repeatedly. Of course, you meant legally, by constitutional and democratic means, but that seemed just a bit too tedious to them. They had them all together in one room, where they could be eliminated easily, and.⁠ ⁠… Lanze; see if you can get anything on the Citadel telecast.”</p>
			<p>Degbrend put on another communication-screen and fiddled for a moment. What came on was a view, from another angle, of the Convocation Chamber. A voice was saying:</p>
			<p>“… not one left alive. The People’s Labor Police, acting on orders of People’s Manager of Labor Zhorzh Khouzhik and People’s Provost-Marshal Yakoop Zhannar, are now eliminating the rest of the ci-devant Masterly class, all of whom are here in Zeggensburg. The people are directed to cooperate; kill them all, men, women and children. We must allow none of these foul exploiters of the people live to see today’s sun go down.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“You mean, we sit here while those animals butcher women and children?” Shatrak demanded, looking from the Proconsul to the Ministerial Secretary. “Well, by Ghu, I won’t! If I have to face a court for it, all well and good, but.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“You won’t, Admiral. I seem to recall, some years ago, a Commodore Hastings, who got a baronetcy for stopping a pogrom on Anath.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“And broadcast an announcement that any of the Masterly class may find asylum here at the Proconsular Palace. They’re political fugitives; scores of precedents for that,” Erskyll added.</p>
			<p>Shatrak was back at the screen to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i>.</p>
			<p>“Patrique, get a jam-beam focused on that telecast station at the Citadel; get it off the air. Then broadcast on the same wavelength; announce that anybody claiming sanctuary at the Proconsular Palace will be taken in and protected. And start getting troops down, and all the spacemen you can spare.”</p>
			<p>At the same time, Ravney was saying, into his own screen:</p>
			<p>“Plan Four. Variation H-3; this is a rescue operation. This is not, repeat, underscore, <em>not</em> an intervention in planetary government. You are to protect members of the Masterly class in danger from mob violence. That’s anybody with hair on his head. Stay away from the Citadel; the ones there are all dead. Start with the four buildings closest to us, and get them cleared out. If the shaveheads give you any trouble, don’t argue with them, just shoot them.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Erskyll, after his brief moment of decisiveness, was staring at the screen to the Convocation Chamber, where bodies were still being heaved into the lorries like black sacks of grain. Lanze Degbrend summoned a robot, had it pour a highball, and gave it to the Proconsul.</p>
			<p>“Go ahead, Count Erskyll; drink it down. Medicinal,” he was saying. “Believe me you certainly need it.”</p>
			<p>Erskyll gulped it down. “I think I could use another, if you please,” he said, handing the glass back to Lanze. “And a cigarette.” After he had tasted his second drink and puffed on the cigarette, he said: “I was so proud. I thought they were learning democracy.”</p>
			<p>“We don’t, any of us, have too much to be proud about,” Degbrend told him. “They must have been planning and preparing this for a couple of months, and we never caught a whisper of it.”</p>
			<p>That was correct. They had deluded Erskyll into thinking that they were going to let the Masters vote themselves out of power and set up a representative government. They had deluded the Masters into believing that they were in favor of the status quo, and opposed to Erkyll’s democratization and socialization. There must be only a few of them in the conspiracy. Chmidd and Hozhet and Zhannar and Khouzhik and Schferts and the rest of the Citadel chief-slave clique. Among them, they controlled all the armed force. The bickering and rivalries must have been part of the camouflage. He supposed that a few of the upper army commanders had been in on it, too.</p>
			<p>A communication-screen began making noises. Somebody flipped the switch, and Khreggor Chmidd appeared in it. Erskyll swore softly, and went to face the screen-image of the elephantine ex-slave of the ex-Lord Master, the late Rovard Javasan.</p>
			<p>“Citizen Proconsul; why is our telecast station, which is vitally needed to give information to the people, jammed off the air, and why are you broadcasting, on our wavelength, advice to the criminals of the ci-devant Masterly class to take refuge in your Proconsular Palace from the just vengeance of the outraged victims of their century-long exploitation?” he began. “This is a flagrant violation of the Imperial Constitution; our Emperor will not be pleased at this unjustified intervention in the affairs, and this interference with the planetary authority, of the People’s Commonwealth of Aditya!”</p>
			<p>Obray of Erskyll must have realized, for the first time, that he was still holding a highball glass in one hand and a cigarette in the other. He flung both of them away.</p>
			<p>“If the Imperial troops we are sending into the city to rescue women and children in danger from your hoodlums meet with the least resistance, you won’t be in a position to find out what his Majesty thinks about it, because Admiral Shatrak will have you and your accomplices shot in the Convocation Chamber, where you massacred the legitimate government of this planet,” he barked.</p>
			<p>So the real Obray, Count Erskyll, had at last emerged. All the liberalism and socialism and egalitarianism, all the Helping-Hand, Torch-of-Democracy, idealism, was merely a surface stucco applied at the university during the last six years. For twenty-four years before that, from the day of his birth, he had been taught, by his parents, his nurse, his governess, his tutors, what it meant to be an Erskyll of Aton and a grandson of Errol, Duke of Yorvoy. As he watched Khreggor Chmidd in the screen, he grew angrier, if possible.</p>
			<p>“Do you know what you bloodthirsty imbeciles have done?” he demanded. “You have just murdered, along with two thousand men, some five billion crowns, the money needed to finance all these fine modernization and industrialization plans. Or are you crazy enough to think that the Empire is going to indemnify you for being emancipated and pay that money over to you?”</p>
			<p>“But, Citizen Proconsul.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“And don’t call me Citizen Proconsul! I am a noble of the Galactic Empire, and on this pigpen of a planet I represent his Imperial Majesty. You will respect, and address, me accordingly.”</p>
			<p>Khreggor Chmidd no longer wore the gorget of servility, but, as Lanze Degbrend had once remarked, it was still tattooed on his soul. He gulped.</p>
			<p>“Y-yes, Lord-Master Proconsul!”</p>
			<p>They were together again in the big conference-room, which Vann Shatrak had been using, through the day, as an extemporised Battle-Control. They slumped wearily in chairs; they smoked and drank coffee; they anxiously looked from viewscreen to viewscreen, wondering when, and how soon, the trouble would break out again. It was dark, outside, now. Floodlights threw a white dazzle from the top of the Proconsular Palace and from the tops of the four buildings around it that Imperial troops had cleared and occupied, and from contragravity vehicles above. There was light and activity at the Citadel, and in the Servile City to the southeast; the rest of Zeggensburg was dark and quiet.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think we’ll have any more trouble,” Admiral Shatrak was saying. “They won’t be fools enough to attack us here, and all the Masters are dead, except for the ones we’re sheltering.”</p>
			<p>“How many did we save?” Count Erskyll asked.</p>
			<p>Eight hundred odd, Shatrak told him. Erskyll caught his breath.</p>
			<p>“So few! Why, there were almost twelve thousand of them in the city this morning.”</p>
			<p>“I’m surprised we saved so many,” Lanze Degbrend said. He still wore combat coveralls, and a pistol-belt lay beside his chair. “Most of them were killed in the first hour.”</p>
			<p>And that had been before the landing-craft from the ships had gotten down, and there had only been seven hundred men and forty vehicles available. He had gone out with them, himself; it had been the first time he had worn battledress and helmet or carried a weapon except for sport in almost thirty years. It had been an ugly, bloody, business; one he wanted to forget as speedily as possible. There had been times, after seeing the mutilated bodies of Masterly women and children, when he had been forced to remind himself that he had come out to prevent, not to participate in, a massacre. Some of Ravney’s men hadn’t even tried. Atrocity has a horrible facility for begetting atrocity.</p>
			<p>“What’ll we do with them?” Erskyll asked. “We can’t turn them loose; they’d all be murdered in a matter of hours, and in any case, they’d have nowhere to go. The Commonwealth,”⁠—he pronounced the name he had himself selected as though it were an obscenity⁠—“has nationalized all the Masterly property.”</p>
			<p>That had been announced almost as soon as the Citadel telecast-station had been unjammed, and shortly thereafter they had begun encountering bodies of Yakoop Zhannar’s soldiers and Zhorzh Khouzhik’s police who had been sent out to stop looting and vandalism and occupy the Masterly palaces. There had been considerable shooting in the Servile City; evidently the ex-slaves had to be convinced that they must not pillage or destroy their places of employment.</p>
			<p>“Evacuate them off-planet,” Shatrak said. “As soon as <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Algol</i> gets here, we’ll load the lot of them onto <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Mizar</i> or <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Canopus</i> and haul them somewhere. Ghu only knows how they’ll live, but.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Oh, they won’t be paupers, or public charges, Admiral,” he said. “You know, there’s an estimated five billion crowns in slave-compensation, and when I return to Odin I shall represent most strongly that these survivors be paid the whole sum. But I shall emphatically not recommend that they be resettled on Odin. They won’t be at all grateful to us for today’s business, and on Odin they could easily stir up some very adverse public sentiment.”</p>
			<p>“My resignation will answer any criticism of the Establishment the public may make,” Erskyll began.</p>
			<p>“Oh, rubbish; don’t talk about resigning, Obray. You made a few mistakes here, though I can’t think of a better planet in the Galaxy on which you could have made them. But no matter what you did or did not do, this would have happened eventually.”</p>
			<p>“You really think so?” Obray, Count Erskyll, was desperately anxious to be assured of that. “Perhaps if I hadn’t been so insistent on this constitution.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“That wouldn’t have made a particle of difference. We all made this inevitable simply by coming here. Before we came, it would have been impossible. No slave would have been able even to imagine a society without Lords-Master; you heard Chmidd and Hozhet, the first day, aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Empress Eulalie</i>. A slave had to have a Master; he simply couldn’t belong to nobody at all. And until you started talking socialization, nobody could have imagined property without a Masterly property-owning class. And a massacre like this would have been impossible to organize or execute. For one thing, it required an elaborate conspiratorial organization, and until we emancipated them, no slave would have dared trust any other slave; every one would have betrayed any other to curry favor with his Lord-Master. We taught them that they didn’t need Lords-Master, or Masterly favor, any more. And we presented them with a situation their established routines didn’t cover, and forced them into doing some original thinking, which must have hurt like Nifflheim at first. And we retrained the army and handed it over to Yakoop Zhannar, and inspired Zhorzh Khouzhik to organize the Labor Police, and fundamentally, no government is anything but armed force. Really, Obray, I can’t see that you can be blamed for anything but speeding up an inevitable process slightly.”</p>
			<p>“You think they’ll see it that way at Asgard?”</p>
			<p>“You mean the Prime Minister and His Majesty? That will be the way I shall present it to them. That was another reason I wanted to stay on here. I anticipated that you might want a credible witness to what was going to happen,” he said. “Now, you’ll be here for not more than five years before you’re promoted elsewhere. Nobody remains longer than that on a first Proconsular appointment. Just keep your eyes and ears and, especially, your mind, open while you are here. You will learn many things undreamed-of by the political-science faculty at the University of Nefertiti.”</p>
			<p>“You said I made mistakes,” Erskyll mentioned, ready to start learning immediately.</p>
			<p>“Yes. I pointed one of them out to you some time ago: emotional involvement with local groups. You began sympathizing with the servile class here almost immediately. I don’t think either of us learned anything about them that the other didn’t, yet I found them despicable, one and all. Why did you think them worthy of your sympathy?”</p>
			<p>“Why, because.⁠ ⁠…” For a moment, that was as far as he could get. His motivation had been thalamic rather than cortical and he was having trouble externalizing it verbally. “They were <em>slaves</em>. They were being exploited and oppressed.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“And, of course, their exploiters were a lot of heartless villains, so that made the slaves good and virtuous innocents. That was your real, fundamental, mistake. You know, Obray, the downtrodden and long-suffering proletariat aren’t at all good or innocent or virtuous. They are just incompetent; they lack the abilities necessary for overt villainy. You saw, this afternoon, what they were capable of doing when they were given an opportunity. You know, it’s quite all right to give the underdog a hand, but only one hand. Keep the other hand on your pistol⁠—or he’ll try to eat the one you gave him! As you may have noticed, today, when underdogs get up, they tend to turn out to be wolves.”</p>
			<p>“What do you think this Commonwealth will develop into, under Chmidd and Hozhet and Khouzhik and the rest?” Lanze Degbrend asked, to keep the lecture going.</p>
			<p>“Oh, a slave-state, of course; look who’s running it, and whom it will govern. Not the kind of a slave-state we can do anything about,” he hastened to add. “The Commonwealth will be very definite about recognizing that sapient beings cannot be property. But all the rest of the property will belong to the Commonwealth. Remember that remark of Chmidd’s: ‘It will belong to everybody, but somebody will have to take care of it for everybody. That will be you and me.’ ”</p>
			<p>Erskyll frowned. “I remember that. I didn’t like it, at the time. It sounded.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Out of character, for a good and virtuous proletarian; almost Masterly, in fact. He continued:</p>
			<p>“The Commonwealth will be sole employer as well as sole property-owner, and anybody who wants to eat will have to work for the Commonwealth on the Commonwealth’s terms. Chmidd’s and Hozhet’s and Khouzhik’s, that is. If that isn’t substitution of peonage for chattel slavery, I don’t know what the word peonage means. But you’ll do nothing to interfere. You will see to it that Aditya stays in the empire and adheres to the Constitution and makes no trouble for anybody off-planet. I fancy you won’t find that too difficult. They’ll be good, as long as you deny them the means to be anything else. And make sure that they continue to call you Lord-Master Proconsul.”</p>
			<p>Lecturing, he found, was dry work. He summoned a bartending robot:</p>
			<p>“Ho, slave! Attend your Lord-Master!”</p>
			<p>Then he had to use his ultraviolet pencil-light to bring it to him, and dial for the brandy-and-soda he wanted. As long as that was necessary, there really wasn’t anything to worry about. But some of these days, they’d build robots that would anticipate orders, and robots to operate robots, and robots to supervise them, and.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>No. It wouldn’t quite come to that. A slave is a slave, but a robot is only a robot. As long as they stuck to robots, they were reasonably safe.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Crossroads of Destiny</h2>
			<p>I still have the dollar bill. It’s in my box at the bank, and I think that’s where it will stay. I simply won’t destroy it, but I can think of nobody to whom I’d be willing to show it⁠—certainly nobody at the college, my History Department colleagues least of all. Merely to tell the story would brand me irredeemably as a crackpot, but crackpots are tolerated, even on college faculties. It’s only when they begin producing physical evidence that they get themselves actively resented.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>When I went into the club-car for a nightcap before going back to my compartment to turn in, there were five men there, sitting together.</p>
			<p>One was an Army officer, with the insignia and badges of a Staff Intelligence colonel. Next to him was a man of about my own age, with sandy hair and a bony, Scottish looking face, who sat staring silently into a highball which he held in both hands. Across the aisle, an elderly man, who could have been a lawyer or a banker, was smoking a cigar over a glass of port, and beside him sat a plump and slightly too well groomed individual who had a tall colorless drink, probably gin-and-tonic. The fifth man, separated from him by a vacant chair, seemed to be dividing his attention between a book on his lap and the conversation, in which he was taking no part. I sat down beside the sandy-haired man; as I did so and rang for the waiter, the colonel was saying:</p>
			<p>“No, that wouldn’t. I can think of a better one. Suppose you have Columbus get his ships from Henry the Seventh of England and sail under the English instead of the Spanish flag. You know, he did try to get English backing, before he went to Spain, but King Henry turned him down. That could be changed.”</p>
			<p>I pricked up my ears. The period from 1492 to the Revolution is my special field of American history, and I knew, at once, the enormous difference that would have made. It was a moment later that I realized how oddly the colonel had expressed the idea, and by that time the plump man was speaking.</p>
			<p>“Yes, that would work,” he agreed. “Those kings made decisions, most of the time, on whether or not they had a hangover, or what some court favorite thought.” He got out a notebook and pen and scribbled briefly. “I’ll hand that to the planning staff when I get to New York. That’s Henry the Seventh, not Henry the Eighth? Right. We’ll fix it so that Columbus will catch him when he’s in a good humor.”</p>
			<p>That was too much. I turned to the man beside me.</p>
			<p>“What goes on?” I asked. “Has somebody invented a time machine?”</p>
			<p>He looked up from the drink he was contemplating and gave me a grin.</p>
			<p>“Sounds like it, doesn’t it? Why, no; our friend here is getting up a television program. Tell the gentleman about it,” he urged the plump man across the aisle.</p>
			<p>The waiter arrived at that moment. The plump man, who seemed to need little urging, waited until I had ordered a drink and then began telling me what a positively sensational idea it was.</p>
			<p>“We’re calling it ‘Crossroads of Destiny,’ ” he said. “It’ll be a series, one half-hour show a week; in each episode, we’ll take some historic event and show how history could have been changed if something had happened differently. We dramatize the event up to that point just as it really happened, and then a commentary-voice comes on and announces that this is the Crossroads of Destiny; this is where history could have been completely changed. Then he gives a resumé of what really did happen, and then he says, ‘<em>But</em>⁠—suppose so-and-so had done this and that, instead of such and such.’ Then we pick up the dramatization at that point, only we show it the way it might have happened. Like this thing about Columbus; we’ll show how it could have happened, and end with Columbus wading ashore with his sword in one hand and a flag in the other, just like the painting, only it’ll be the English flag, and Columbus will shout: ‘I take possession of this new land in the name of His Majesty, Henry the Seventh of England!’ ” He brandished his drink, to the visible consternation of the elderly man beside him. “And then, the sailors all sing ‘God Save the King.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Which wasn’t written till about 1745,” I couldn’t help mentioning.</p>
			<p>“Huh?” The plump man looked startled. “Are you sure?” Then he decided that I was, and shrugged. “Well, they can all shout, ‘God Save King Henry!’ or ‘<abbr>St.</abbr> George for England!’ or something. Then, at the end, we introduce the program guest, some history expert, a real name, and he tells how he thinks history would have been changed if it had happened this way.”</p>
			<p>The conservatively dressed gentleman beside him wanted to know how long he expected to keep the show running.</p>
			<p>“The crossroads will give out before long,” he added.</p>
			<p>“The sponsor’ll give out first,” I said. “History is just one damn crossroads after another.” I mentioned, in passing, that I taught the subject. “Why, since the beginning of this century, we’ve had enough of them to keep the show running for a year.”</p>
			<p>“We have about twenty already written and ready to produce,” the plump man said comfortably, “and ideas for twice as many that the planning staff is working on now.”</p>
			<p>The elderly man accepted that and took another cautious sip of wine.</p>
			<p>“What I wonder, though, is whether you can really say that history can be changed.”</p>
			<p>“Well, of course⁠—” The television man was taken aback; one always seems to be when a basic assumption is questioned. “Of course, we only know what really did happen, but it stands to reason if something had happened differently, the results would have been different, doesn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“But it seems to me that everything would work out the same in the long run. There’d be some differences at the time, but over the years wouldn’t they all cancel out?”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Non, non, Monsieur!</i>” the man with the book, who had been outside the conversation until now, told him earnestly. “Make no mistake; ’istoree can be shange’!”</p>
			<p>I looked at him curiously. The accent sounded French, but it wasn’t quite right. He was some kind of a foreigner, though; I’d swear that he never bought the clothes he was wearing in this country. The way the suit fitted, and the cut of it, and the shirt-collar, and the necktie. The book he was reading was Langmuir’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Social History of the American People</i>⁠—not one of my favorites, a bit too much on the doctrinaire side, but what a bookshop clerk would give a foreigner looking for something to explain America.</p>
			<p>“What do you think, Professor?” the plump man was asking me.</p>
			<p>“It would work out the other way. The differences wouldn’t cancel out; they’d accumulate. Say something happened a century ago, to throw a presidential election the other way. You’d get different people at the head of the government, opposite lines of policy taken, and eventually we’d be getting into different wars with different enemies at different times, and different batches of young men killed before they could marry and have families⁠—different people being born or not being born. That would mean different ideas, good or bad, being advanced; different books written; different inventions, and different social and economic problems as a consequence.”</p>
			<p>“Look, he’s only giving himself a century,” the colonel added. “Think of the changes if this thing we were discussing, Columbus sailing under the English flag, had happened. Or suppose Leif Ericson had been able to plant a permanent colony in America in the Eleventh Century, or if the Saracens had won the Battle of Tours. Try to imagine the world today if any of those things had happened. One thing you can be sure of⁠—any errors you make in trying to imagine such a world will be on the side of over-conservatism.”</p>
			<p>The sandy-haired man beside me, who had been using his highball for a crystal ball, must have glimpsed in it what he was looking for. He finished the drink, set the empty glass on the stand-tray beside him, and reached back to push the button.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think you realize just how good an idea you have, here,” he told the plump man abruptly. “If you did, you wouldn’t ruin it with such timid and unimaginative treatment.”</p>
			<p>I thought he’d been staying out of the conversation because it was over his head. Instead, he had been taking the plump man’s idea apart, examining all the pieces, and considering what was wrong with it and how it could be improved. The plump man looked startled, and then angry⁠—timid and unimaginative were the last things he’d expected his idea to be called. Then he became uneasy. Maybe this fellow was a typical representative of his lord and master, the faceless abstraction called the Public.</p>
			<p>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Misplaced emphasis. You shouldn’t emphasize the event that could have changed history; you should emphasize the changes that could have been made. You’re going to end this show you were talking about with a shot of Columbus wading up to the beach with an English flag, aren’t you?”</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s the logical ending.”</p>
			<p>“That’s the logical beginning,” the sandy-haired man contradicted. “And after that, your guest historian comes on; how much time will he be allowed?”</p>
			<p>“Well, maybe three or four minutes. We can’t cut the dramatization too short⁠—”</p>
			<p>“And he’ll have to explain, a couple of times, and in words of one syllable, that what we have seen didn’t really happen, because if he doesn’t, the next morning half the twelve-year-old kids in the country will be rushing wild-eyed into school to slip the teacher the real inside about the discovery of America. By the time he gets that done, he’ll be able to mumble a couple of generalities about vast and incalculable effects, and then it’ll be time to tell the public about Widgets, the really safe cigarettes, all filter and absolutely free from tobacco.”</p>
			<p>The waiter arrived at this point, and the sandy-haired man ordered another rye highball. I decided to have another bourbon on the rocks, and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> impresario said, “Gin-and-tonic,” absently, and went into a reverie which lasted until the drinks arrived. Then he came awake again.</p>
			<p>“I see what you mean,” he said. “Most of the audience would wonder what difference it would have made where Columbus would have gotten his ships, as long as he got them and America got discovered. I can see it would have made a hell of a big difference. But how could it be handled any other way? How could you figure out just what the difference would have been?”</p>
			<p>“Well, you need a man who’d know the historical background, and you’d need a man with a powerful creative imagination, who is used to using it inside rigorously defined limits. Don’t try to get them both in one; a collaboration would really be better. Then you work from the known situation in Europe and in America in 1492, and decide on the immediate effects. And from that, you have to carry it along, step by step, down to the present. It would be a lot of hard and very exacting work, but the result would be worth it.” He took a sip from his glass and added: “Remember, you don’t have to prove that the world today would be the way you set it up. All you have to do is make sure that nobody else would be able to prove that it wouldn’t.”</p>
			<p>“Well, how could you present that?”</p>
			<p>“As a play, with fictional characters and a plot; time, the present, under the changed conditions. The plot⁠—the reason the coward conquers his fear and becomes a hero, the obstacle to the boy marrying the girl, the reason the innocent man is being persecuted⁠—will have to grow out of this imaginary world you’ve constructed, and be impossible in our real world. As long as you stick to that, you’re all right.”</p>
			<p>“Sure. I get that.” The plump man was excited again; he was about half sold on the idea. “But how will we get the audience to accept it? We’re asking them to start with an assumption they know isn’t true.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe it is, in another time-dimension,” the colonel suggested. “You can’t prove it isn’t. For that matter, you can’t prove there aren’t other time-dimensions.”</p>
			<p>“Hah, that’s it!” the sandy-haired man exclaimed. “World of alternate probability. That takes care of that.”</p>
			<p>He drank about a third of his highball and sat gazing into the rest of it, in an almost yogic trance. The plump man looked at the colonel in bafflement.</p>
			<p>“Maybe this alternate-probability time-dimension stuff means something to you,” he said. “Be damned if it does to me.”</p>
			<p>“Well, as far as we know, we live in a four-dimensional universe,” the colonel started.</p>
			<p>The elderly man across from him groaned. “Fourth dimension! Good God, are we going to talk about that?”</p>
			<p>“It isn’t anything to be scared of. You carry an instrument for measuring in the fourth dimension all the time. A watch.”</p>
			<p>“You mean it’s just time? But that isn’t⁠—”</p>
			<p>“We know of three dimensions of space,” the colonel told him, gesturing to indicate them. “We can use them for coordinates to locate things, but we also locate things in time. I wouldn’t like to ride on a train or a plane if we didn’t. Well, let’s call the time we know, the time your watch registers, Time-A. Now, suppose the entire, infinite extent of Time-A is only an instant in another dimension of time, which we’ll call Time-B. The next instant of Time-B is also the entire extent of Time-A, and the next and the next. As in Time-A, different things are happening at different instants. In one of these instants of Time-B, one of the things that’s happening is that King Henry the Seventh of England is furnishing ships to Christopher Columbus.”</p>
			<p>The man with the odd clothes was getting excited again.</p>
			<p>“Zees⁠—’ow you say⁠—zees alternate probabeelitay; eet ees a theory zhenerally accept’ een zees countree?”</p>
			<p>“Got it!” the sandy-haired man said, before anybody could answer. He set his drink on the stand-tray and took a big jackknife out of his pocket, holding it unopened in his hand. “How’s this sound?” he asked, and hit the edge of the tray with the back of the knife, <i>Bong</i>!</p>
			<p>“Crossroads⁠—of⁠—<em>Destiny</em>!” he intoned, and hit the edge of the tray again, <i>Bong</i>! “This is the year 1959⁠—but not the 1959 of our world, for we are in a world of alternate probability, in another dimension of time; a world parallel to and coexistent with but separate from our own, in which history has been completely altered by a single momentous event.” He shifted back to his normal voice.</p>
			<p>“Not bad; only twenty-five seconds,” the plump man said, looking up from his wrist watch. “And a trained announcer could maybe shave five seconds off that. Yes, something like that, and at the end we’ll have another thirty seconds, and we can do without the guest.”</p>
			<p>“But zees alternate probibeelitay, in anozzer dimension,” the stranger was insisting. “Ees zees a concept original weet you?” he asked the colonel.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no; that idea’s been around for a long time.”</p>
			<p>“I never heard of it before now,” the elderly man said, as though that completely demolished it.</p>
			<p>“Zen eet ees zhenerally accept’ by zee scienteest’?”</p>
			<p>“Umm, no,” the sandy-haired man relieved the colonel. “There’s absolutely no evidence to support it, and scientists don’t accept unsupported assumptions unless they need them to explain something, and they don’t need this assumption for anything. Well, it would come in handy to make some of these reports of freak phenomena, like mysterious appearances and disappearances, or flying-object sightings, or reported falls of non-meteoric matter, theoretically respectable. Reports like that usually get the ignore-and-forget treatment, now.”</p>
			<p>“Zen you believe zat zeese ozzer world of zee alternate probabeelitay, zey exist?”</p>
			<p>“No. I don’t disbelieve it, either. I’ve no reason to, one way or another.” He studied his drink for a moment, and lowered the level in the glass slightly. “I’ve said that once in a while things get reported that look as though such other worlds, in another time-dimension, may exist. There have been whole books published by people who collect stories like that. I must say that academic science isn’t very hospitable to them.”</p>
			<p>“You mean, zings sometimes, ’ow-you-say, leak in from one of zees ozzer worlds? Zat has been known to ’appen?”</p>
			<p>“Things have been said to have happened that might, if true, be cases of things leaking through from another time world,” the sandy-haired man corrected. “Or leaking away to another time world.” He mentioned a few of the more famous cases of unexplained mysteries⁠—the English diplomat in Prussia who vanished in plain sight of a number of people, the ship found completely deserted by her crew, the lifeboats all in place; stories like that. “And there’s this rash of alleged sightings of unidentified flying objects. I’d sooner believe that they came from another dimension than from another planet. But, as far as I know, nobody’s seriously advanced this other-time-dimension theory to explain them.”</p>
			<p>“I think the idea’s familiar enough, though, that we can use it as an explanation, or pseudo-explanation, for the program,” the television man said. “Fact is, we aren’t married to this Crossroads title, yet; we could just as easily all it ‘Fifth Dimension.’ That would lead the public, to expect something out of the normal before the show started.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>That got the conversation back onto the show, and we talked for some time about it, each of us suggesting possibilities. The stranger even suggested one⁠—that the Civil War had started during the Jackson Administration. Fortunately, nobody else noticed that. Finally, a porter came through and inquired if any of us were getting off at Harrisburg, saying that we would be getting in in five minutes.</p>
			<p>The stranger finished his drink hastily and got up, saying that he would have to get his luggage. He told us how much he had enjoyed the conversation, and then followed the porter toward the rear of the train. After he had gone out, the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> man chuckled.</p>
			<p>“Was that one an oddball!” he exclaimed. “Where the hell do you suppose he got that suit?”</p>
			<p>“It was a tailored suit,” the colonel said. “A very good one. And I can’t think of any country in the world in which they cut suits just like that. And did you catch his accent?”</p>
			<p>“Phony,” the television man pronounced. “The French accent of a Greek waiter in a fake French restaurant. In the Bronx.”</p>
			<p>“Not quite. The pronunciation was all right for French accent, but the cadence, the way the word-sounds were strung together, was German.”</p>
			<p>The elderly man looked at the colonel keenly. “I see you’re Intelligence,” he mentioned. “Think he might be somebody up your alley, Colonel?”</p>
			<p>The colonel shook his head. “I doubt it. There are agents of unfriendly powers in this country⁠—a lot of them, I’m sorry to have to say. But they don’t speak accented English, and they don’t dress eccentrically. You know there’s an enemy agent in a crowd, pick out the most normally American type in sight and you usually won’t have to look further.”</p>
			<p>The train ground to a stop. A young couple with hand-luggage came in and sat at one end of the car, waiting until other accommodations could be found for them. After a while, it started again. I dallied over my drink, and then got up and excused myself, saying that I wanted to turn in early.</p>
			<p>In the next car behind, I met the porter who had come in just before the stop. He looked worried, and after a moment’s hesitation, he spoke to me.</p>
			<p>“Pardon, sir. The man in the club-car who got off at Harrisburg; did you know him?”</p>
			<p>“Never saw him before. Why?”</p>
			<p>“He tipped me with a dollar bill when he got off. Later, I looked closely at it. I do not like it.”</p>
			<p>He showed it to me, and I didn’t blame him. It was marked <q>One Dollar</q>, and <q>United States of America</q>, but outside that there wasn’t a thing right about it. One side was gray, all right, but the other side was green. The picture wasn’t the right one. And there were a lot of other things about it, some of them absolutely ludicrous. It wasn’t counterfeit⁠—it wasn’t even an imitation of a United States bill.</p>
			<p>And then it hit me, like a bullet in the chest. Not a bill of <em>our</em> United States. No wonder he had been so interested in whether our scientists accepted the theory of other time dimensions and other worlds of alternate probability!</p>
			<p>On an impulse, I got out two ones and gave them to the porter⁠—perfectly good United States Bank gold-certificates.</p>
			<p>“You’d better let me keep this,” I said, trying to make it sound the way he’d think a Federal Agent would say it. He took the bills, smiling, and I folded his bill and put it into my vest pocket.</p>
			<p>“Thank you, sir,” he said. “I have no wish to keep it.”</p>
			<p>Some part of my mind below the level of consciousness must have taken over and guided me back to the right car and compartment; I didn’t realize where I was going till I put on the light and recognized my own luggage. Then I sat down, as dizzy as though the two drinks I had had, had been a dozen. For a moment, I was tempted to rush back to the club-car and show the thing to the colonel and the sandy-haired man. On second thought, I decided against that.</p>
			<p>The next thing I banished from my mind was the adjective “incredible.” I had to credit it; I had the proof in my vest pocket. The coincidence arising from our topic of conversation didn’t bother me too much, either. It was the topic which had drawn him into it. And, as the sandy-haired man had pointed out, we know nothing, one way or another, about these other worlds; we certainly don’t know what barriers separate them from our own, or how often those barriers may fail. I might have thought more about that if I’d been in physical science. I wasn’t; I was in American history. So what I thought about was what sort of country that other United States must be, and what its history must have been.</p>
			<p>The man’s costume was basically the same as ours⁠—same general style, but many little differences of fashion. I had the impression that it was the costume of a less formal and conservative society than ours and a more casual way of life. It could be the sort of costume into which ours would evolve in another thirty or so years. There was another odd thing. I’d noticed him looking curiously at both the waiter and the porter, as though something about them surprised him. The only thing they had in common was their race, the same as every other passenger-car attendant. But he wasn’t used to seeing Chinese working in railway cars.</p>
			<p>And there had been that remark about the Civil War and the Jackson Administration. I wondered what Jackson he had been talking about; not Andrew Jackson, the Tennessee militia general who got us into war with Spain in 1810, I hoped. And the Civil War; that had baffled me completely. I wondered if it had been a class-war, or a sectional conflict. We’d had plenty of the latter, during our first century, but all of them had been settled peacefully and Constitutionally. Well, some of the things he’d read in Lingmuir’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Social History</i> would be surprises for him, too.</p>
			<p>And then I took the bill out for another examination. It must have gotten mixed with his spendable money⁠—it was about the size of ours⁠—and I wondered how he had acquired enough of our money to pay his train fare. Maybe he’d had a diamond and sold it, or maybe he’d had a gun and held somebody up. If he had, I didn’t know that I blamed him, under the circumstances. I had an idea that he had some realization of what had happened to him⁠—the book, and the fake accent, to cover any mistakes he might make. Well, I wished him luck, and then I unfolded the dollar bill and looked at it again.</p>
			<p>In the first place, it had been issued by the United States Department of Treasury itself, not the United States Bank or one of the State Banks. I’d have to think over the implications of that carefully. In the second place, it was a silver certificate; why, in this other United States, silver must be an acceptable monetary metal; maybe equally so with gold, though I could hardly believe that. Then I looked at the picture on the gray obverse side, and had to strain my eyes on the fine print under it to identify it. It was Washington, all right, but a much older Washington than any of the pictures of him I had ever seen. Then I realized that I knew just where the Crossroads of Destiny for his world and mine had been.</p>
			<p>As every schoolchild among us knows, General George Washington was shot dead at the Battle of Germantown, in 1777, by an English, or, rather, Scottish, officer, Patrick Ferguson⁠—the same Patrick Ferguson who invented the breech-loading rifle that smashed Napoleon’s armies. Washington, today, is one of our lesser national heroes, because he was our first military commander-in-chief. But in this other world, he must have survived to lead our armies to victory and become our first President, as was the case with the man who took his place when he was killed.</p>
			<p>I folded the bill and put it away carefully among my identification cards, where it wouldn’t a second time get mixed with the money I spent, and as I did, I wondered what sort of a President George Washington had made, and what part, in the history of that other United States, had been played by the man whose picture appears on our dollar bills⁠—General and President Benedict Arnold.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Day of the Moron</h2>
			<p>There were still, in 1968, a few people who were afraid of the nuclear power plant. Oldsters, in whom the term “atomic energy” produced semantic reactions associated with Hiroshima. Those who saw, in the towering steam-column above it, a tempting target for enemy⁠—which still meant Soviet⁠—bombers and guided missiles. Some of the Central Intelligence and <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">F.B.I.</abbr> people, who realized how futile even the most elaborate security measures were against a resourceful and suicidally determined saboteur. And a minority of engineers and nuclear physicists who remained unpersuaded that accidental blowups at nuclear-reaction plants were impossible.</p>
			<p>Scott Melroy was among these last. He knew, as a matter of fact, that there had been several nasty, meticulously unpublicized, near-catastrophes at the Long Island Nuclear Reaction Plant, all involving the new Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactors, and that there had been considerable carefully-hushed top-level acrimony before the Melroy Engineering Corporation had been given the contract to install the fully cybernetic control system intended to prevent a recurrence of such incidents.</p>
			<p>That had been three months ago. Melroy and his people had moved in, been assigned sections of a couple of machine shops, set up an assembly shop and a set of plyboard-partitioned offices in a vacant warehouse just outside the reactor area, and tried to start work, only to run into the almost interminable procedural disputes and jurisdictional wranglings of the sort which he privately labeled “bureau bunk.” It was only now that he was ready to begin work on the reactors.</p>
			<p>He sat at his desk, in the inner of three successively smaller offices on the second floor of the converted warehouse, checking over a symbolic-logic analysis of a relay system and, at the same time, sharpening a pencil, his knife paring off tiny feathery shavings of wood. He was a tall, sparely-built, man of indeterminate age, with thinning sandy hair, a long Gaelic upper lip, and a wide, half-humorous, half-weary mouth; he wore an open-necked shirt, and an old and shabby leather jacket, to the left shoulder of which a few clinging flecks of paint showed where some military emblem had been, long ago. While his fingers worked with the jackknife and his eyes traveled over the page of closely-written symbols, his mind was reviewing the eight different ways in which one of the efficient but treacherous Doernberg-Giardano reactors could be allowed to reach critical mass, and he was wondering if there might not be some unsuspected ninth way. That was a possibility which always lurked in the back of his mind, and lately it had been giving him surrealistic nightmares.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy!” the box on the desk in front of him said suddenly, in a feminine voice. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives is here.”</p>
			<p>Melroy picked up the handphone, thumbing on the switch.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives?” he repeated.</p>
			<p>“The psychologist who’s subbing for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> von Heydenreich,” the box told him patiently.</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes. Show him in,” Melroy said.</p>
			<p>“Right away, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy,” the box replied.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Replacing the handphone, Melroy wondered, for a moment, why there had been a hint of suppressed amusement in his secretary’s voice. Then the door opened and he stopped wondering. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives wasn’t a him; she was a her. Very attractive looking her, too⁠—dark hair and eyes, rather long-oval features, clear, lightly tanned complexion, bright red lipstick put on with a micrometric exactitude that any engineer could appreciate. She was tall, within four inches of his own six-foot mark, and she wore a black tailored outfit, perfectly plain, which had probably cost around five hundred dollars and would have looked severe and mannish except that the figure under it curved and bulged in just the right places and to just the right degree.</p>
			<p>Melroy rose, laying down knife and pencil and taking his pipe out of his mouth.</p>
			<p>“Good afternoon,” he greeted. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> von Heydenreich gave me quite a favorable account of you⁠—as far as it went. He might have included a few more data and made it more so.⁠ ⁠… Won’t you sit down?”</p>
			<p>The woman laid her handbag on the desk and took the visitor’s chair, impish mirth sparking in her eyes.</p>
			<p>“He probably omitted mentioning that the <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> is for Doris,” she suggested. “Suppose I’d been an Englishman with a name like Evelyn or Vivian?”</p>
			<p>Melroy tried to visualize her as a male Englishman named Vivian, gave up, and grinned at her.</p>
			<p>“Let this be a lesson,” he said. “Inferences are to be drawn from objects, or descriptions of objects; never from verbal labels. Do you initial your first name just to see how people react when they meet you?”</p>
			<p>“Well, no, though that’s an amusing and sometimes instructive byproduct. It started when I began contributing to some of the professional journals. There’s still a little of what used to be called male sex-chauvinism among my colleagues, and some who would be favorably impressed with an article signed <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Warren Rives might snort in contempt at the same article signed Doris Rives.”</p>
			<p>“Well, fortunately, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> von Heydenreich isn’t one of those,” Melroy said. “How is the Herr Doktor, by the way, and just what happened to him? Miss Kourtakides merely told me that he’d been injured and was in a hospital in Pittsburgh.”</p>
			<p>“The Herr Doktor got shot,” Doris Rives informed him. “With a charge of BB’s, in a most indelicate portion of his anatomy. He was out hunting, the last day of small-game season, and somebody mistook him for a turkey. Nothing really serious, but he’s face down in bed, cursing hideously in German, English, Russian, Italian and French, mainly because he’s missing deer hunting.”</p>
			<p>“I might have known it,” Melroy said in disgust. “The ubiquitous lame-brain with a dangerous mechanism.⁠ ⁠… I suppose he briefed you on what I want done, here?”</p>
			<p>“Well, not too completely. I gathered that you want me to give intelligence tests, or aptitude tests, or something of the sort, to some of your employees. I’m not really one of these so-called industrial anthropologists,” she explained. “Most of my work, for the past few years, has been for public-welfare organizations, with subnormal persons. I told him that, and he said that was why he selected me. He said one other thing. He said, ‘I used to think Melroy had an obsession about fools; well, after stopping this load of shot, I’m beginning to think it’s a good subject to be obsessed about.’ ”</p>
			<p>Melroy nodded. “ ‘Obsession’ will probably do. ‘Phobia’ would be more exact. I’m afraid of fools, and the chance that I have one working for me, here, affects me like having a cobra crawling around my bedroom in the dark. I want you to locate any who might be in a gang of new men I’ve had to hire, so that I can get rid of them.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“And just how do you define the term ‘fool,’ <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy?” she asked. “Remember, it has no standard meaning. Republicans apply it to Democrats, and vice versa.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I apply it to people who do things without considering possible consequences. People who pepper distinguished Austrian psychologists in the pants-seat with turkey-shot, for a starter. Or people who push buttons to see what’ll happen, or turn valves and twiddle with dial-knobs because they have nothing else to do with their hands. Or shoot insulators off power lines to see if they can hit them. People who don’t know it’s loaded. People who think warning signs are purely ornamental. People who play practical jokes. People who⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I know what you mean. Just day-before-yesterday, I saw a woman toss a cocktail into an electric heater. She didn’t want to drink it, and she thought it would just go up in steam. The result was slightly spectacular.”</p>
			<p>“Next time, she won’t do that. She’ll probably throw her drink into a lead-ladle, if there’s one around. Well, on a statistical basis, I’d judge that I have three or four such dud rounds among this new gang I’ve hired. I want you to put the finger on them, so I can bounce them before they blow the whole plant up, which could happen quite easily.”</p>
			<p>“That,” Doris Rives said, “is not going to be as easy as it sounds. Ordinary intelligence-testing won’t be enough. The woman I was speaking of has an <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.Q.</abbr> well inside the meaning of normal intelligence. She just doesn’t use it.”</p>
			<p>“Sure.” Melroy got a thick folder out of his desk and handed it across. “Heydenreich thought of that, too. He got this up for me, about five years ago. The intelligence test is based on the new French Sûreté test for mentally deficient criminals. Then there’s a memory test, and tests for judgment and discrimination, semantic reactions, temperamental and emotional makeup, and general mental attitude.”</p>
			<p>She took the folder and leafed through it. “Yes, I see. I always liked this Sûreté test. And this memory test is a honey⁠—‘One hen, two ducks, three squawking geese, four corpulent porpoises, five Limerick oysters, six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers.⁠ ⁠…’ I’d like to see some of these memory-course boys trying to make visual images of six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers. And I’m going to make a copy of this word-association list. It’s really a semantic reaction test; Korzybski would have loved it. And, of course, our old friend, the Rorschach Inkblots. I’ve always harbored the impious suspicion that you can prove almost anything you want to with that. But these question-suggestions for personal interview are really crafty. Did Heydenreich get them up himself?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. And we have stacks and stacks of printed forms for the written portion of the test, and big cards to summarize each subject on. And we have a disk-recorder to use in the oral tests. There’ll have to be a pretty complete record of each test, in case⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The office door opened and a bulky man with a black mustache entered, beating the snow from his overcoat with a battered porkpie hat and commenting blasphemously on the weather. He advanced into the room until he saw the woman in the chair beside the desk, and then started to back out.</p>
			<p>“Come on in, Sid,” Melroy told him. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives, this is our general foreman, Sid Keating. Sid, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives, the new dimwit detector. Sid’s in direct charge of personnel,” he continued, “so you two’ll be working together quite a bit.”</p>
			<p>“Glad to know you, doctor,” Keating said. Then he turned to Melroy. “Scott, you’re really going through with this, then?” he asked. “I’m afraid we’ll have trouble, then.”</p>
			<p>“Look, Sid,” Melroy said. “We’ve been all over that. Once we start work on the reactors, you and Ned Puryear and Joe Ricci and Steve Chalmers can’t be everywhere at once. A cybernetic system will only do what it’s been assembled to do, and if some quarter-wit assembles one of these things wrong⁠—” He left the sentence dangling; both men knew what he meant.</p>
			<p>Keating shook his head. “This union’s going to bawl like a branded calf about it,” he predicted. “And if any of the dear sirs and brothers get washed out⁠—” That sentence didn’t need to be completed, either.</p>
			<p>“We have a right,” Melroy said, “to discharge any worker who is, quote, of unsound mind, deficient mentality or emotional instability, unquote. It says so right in our union contract, in nice big print.”</p>
			<p>“Then they’ll claim the tests are wrong.”</p>
			<p>“I can’t see how they can do that,” Doris Rives put in, faintly scandalized.</p>
			<p>“Neither can I, and they probably won’t either,” Keating told her. “But they’ll go ahead and do it. Why, Scott, they’re pulling the Number One Doernberg-Giardano, tonight. By oh-eight-hundred, it ought to be cool enough to work on. Where will we hold the tests? Here?”</p>
			<p>“We’ll have to, unless we can get <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives security-cleared.” Melroy turned to her. “Were you ever security-cleared by any Government agency?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes. I was with Armed Forces Medical, Psychiatric Division, in Indonesia in ’62 and ’63, and I did some work with mental fatigue cases at Tonto Basin Research Establishment in ’64.”</p>
			<p>Melroy looked at her sharply. Keating whistled.</p>
			<p>“If she could get into Tonto Basin, she can get in here,” he declared.</p>
			<p>“I should think so. I’ll call Colonel Bradshaw, the security officer.”</p>
			<p>“That way, we can test them right on the job,” Keating was saying. “Take them in relays. I’ll talk to Ben about it, and we’ll work up some kind of a schedule.” He turned to Doris Rives. “You’ll need a wrist-Geiger, and a dosimeter. We’ll furnish them,” he told her. “I hope they don’t try to make you carry a pistol, too.”</p>
			<p>“A pistol?” For a moment, she must have thought he was using some technical-jargon term, and then it dawned on her that he wasn’t. “You mean⁠—?” She cocked her thumb and crooked her index finger.</p>
			<p>“Yeah. A rod. Roscoe. The Equalizer. We all have to.” He half-lifted one out of his side pocket. “We’re all United States deputy marshals. They don’t bother much with counterespionage, here, but they don’t fool when it comes to countersabotage. Well, I’ll get an order cut and posted. Be seeing you, doctor.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“You think the union will make trouble about these tests?” she asked, after the general foreman had gone out.</p>
			<p>“They’re sure to,” Melroy replied. “Here’s the situation. I have about fifty of my own men, from Pittsburgh, here, but they can’t work on the reactors because they don’t belong to the Industrial Federation of Atomic Workers, and I can’t just pay their initiation fees and union dues and get union cards for them, because admission to this union is on an annual quota basis, and this is December, and the quota’s full. So I have to use them outside the reactor area, on fabrication and assembly work. And I have to hire through the union, and that’s handled on a membership seniority basis, so I have to take what’s thrown at me. That’s why I was careful to get that clause I was quoting to Sid written into my contract.</p>
			<p>“Now, here’s what’s going to happen. Most of the men’ll take the test without protest, but a few of them’ll raise the roof about it. Nothing burns a moron worse than to have somebody question his fractional intelligence. The odds are that the ones that yell the loudest about taking the test will be the ones who get scrubbed out, and when the test shows that they’re deficient, they won’t believe it. A moron simply cannot conceive of his being anything less than perfectly intelligent, any more than a lunatic can conceive of his being less than perfectly sane. So they’ll claim we’re framing them, for an excuse to fire them. And the union will have to back them up, right or wrong, at least on the local level. That goes without saying. In any dispute, the employer is always wrong and the worker is always right, until proven otherwise. And that takes a lot of doing, believe me!”</p>
			<p>“Well, if they’re hired through the union, on a seniority basis, wouldn’t they be likely to be experienced and competent workers?” she asked.</p>
			<p>“Experienced, yes. That is, none of them has ever been caught doing anything downright calamitous⁠ ⁠… yet,” Melroy replied. “The moron I’m afraid of can go on for years, doing routine work under supervision, and nothing’ll happen. Then, some day, he does something on his own lame-brained initiative, and when he does, it’s only at the whim of whatever gods there be that the result isn’t a wholesale catastrophe. And people like that are the most serious threat facing our civilization today, atomic war not excepted.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Doris Rives lifted a delicately penciled eyebrow over that. Melroy, pausing to relight his pipe, grinned at her.</p>
			<p>“You think that’s the old obsession talking?” he asked. “Could be. But look at this plant, here. It generates every kilowatt of current used between Trenton and Albany, the New York metropolitan area included. Except for a few little storage-battery or Diesel generator systems, that couldn’t handle one tenth of one percent of the barest minimum load, it’s been the only source of electric current here since 1962, when the last coal-burning power plant was dismantled. Knock this plant out and you darken every house and office and factory and street in the area. You immobilize the elevators⁠—think what that would mean in lower and midtown Manhattan alone. And the subways. And the new endless-belt conveyors that handle eighty percent of the city’s freight traffic. And the railroads⁠—there aren’t a dozen steam or Diesel locomotives left in the whole area. And the pump stations for water and gas and fuel oil. And seventy percent of the space-heating is electric, now. Why, you can’t imagine what it’d be like. It’s too gigantic. But what you can imagine would be a nightmare.</p>
			<p>“You know, it wasn’t so long ago, when every home lighted and heated itself, and every little industry was a self-contained unit, that a fool couldn’t do great damage unless he inherited a throne or was placed in command of an army, and that didn’t happen nearly as often as our leftist social historians would like us to think. But today, everything we depend upon is centralized, and vulnerable to blunder-damage. Even our food⁠—remember that poisoned soft-drink horror in Chicago, in 1963; three thousand hospitalized and six hundred dead because of one man’s stupid mistake at a bottling plant.” He shook himself slightly, as though to throw off some shadow that had fallen over him, and looked at his watch. “Sixteen hundred. How did you get here? Fly your own plane?”</p>
			<p>“No; I came by <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">T.W.A.</abbr> from Pittsburgh. I have a room at the new Midtown City hotel, on Forty-seventh Street: I had my luggage sent on there from the airport and came out on the Long Island subway.”</p>
			<p>“Fine. I have a room at Midtown City, myself, though I sleep here about half the time.” He nodded toward a door on the left. “Suppose we go in and have dinner together. This cafeteria, here, is a horrible place. It’s run by a dietitian instead of a chef, and everything’s so white-enamel antiseptic that I swear I smell belladonna-icthyol ointment every time I go in the place. Wait here till I change clothes.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>At the Long Island plant, no one was concerned about espionage⁠—neither the processes nor the equipment used there were secret⁠—but the countersabotage security was fantastically thorough. Every person or scrap of material entering the reactor area was searched; the life-history of every man and woman employed there was known back to the cradle. A broad highway encircled it outside the fence, patrolled night and day by twenty General Stuart cavalry-tanks. There were a thousand soldiers, and three hundred Atomic Power Authority police, and only God knew how many <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">F.B.I.</abbr> and Central Intelligence undercover agents. Every supervisor and inspector and salaried technician was an armed United States deputy marshal. And nobody, outside the Department of Defense, knew how much radar and counter-rocket and fighter protection the place had, but the air-defense zone extended from Boston to Philadelphia and as far inland as Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.</p>
			<p>The Long Island Nuclear Power Plant, Melroy thought, had all the invulnerability of Achilles⁠—and no more.</p>
			<p>The six new Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactors clustered in a circle inside a windowless concrete building at the center of the plant. Beside their primary purpose of plutonium production, they furnished heat for the seawater distillation and chemical extraction system, processing the water that was run through the steam boilers at the main power reactors, condensed, redistilled, and finally pumped, pure, into the water mains of New York. Safe outside the shielding, in a corner of a high-ceilinged room, was the plyboard-screened on-the-job office of the Melroy Engineering Corporation’s timekeepers and foremen. Beyond, along the far wall, were the washroom and locker room and lunch room of the workmen.</p>
			<p>Sixty or seventy men, mostly in white coveralls and all wearing identification badges and carrying dosimeters in their breast pockets and midget Geigers strapped to their wrists, were crowded about the bulletin-board in front of the makeshift office. There was a hum of voices⁠—some perplexed or angry, but mostly good-humored and bantering. As Melroy and Doris Rives approached, the talking died out and the men turned. In the sudden silence, one voice, harshly strident, continued:</p>
			<p>“… do they think this is, anyhow? We don’t hafta take none of that.”</p>
			<p>Somebody must have nudged the speaker, trying without success to hush him. The bellicose voice continued, and Melroy spotted the speaker⁠—short, thickset, his arms jutting out at an angle from his body, his heavy features soured with anger.</p>
			<p>“Like we was a lotta halfwits, ’r nuts, ’r some’n! Well, we don’t hafta stand for this. They ain’t got no right⁠—”</p>
			<p>Doris Rives clung tighter to Melroy’s arm as he pushed a way for himself and her through the crowd and into the temporary office. Inside, they were met by a young man with a deputy marshal’s badge on his flannel shirt and a .38 revolver on his hip.</p>
			<p>“Ben Puryear: <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives,” Melroy introduced. “Who’s the mouthy character outside?”</p>
			<p>“One of the roustabouts; name’s Burris,” Puryear replied. “Washroom lawyer.”</p>
			<p>Melroy nodded. “You always get one or two like that. How’re the rest taking it?”</p>
			<p>Puryear shrugged. “About how you’d expect. A lot of kidding about who’s got any intelligence to test. Burris seems to be the only one who’s trying to make an issue out of it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what are they doing ganged up here?” Melroy wanted to know. “It’s past oh-eight-hundred; why aren’t they at work?”</p>
			<p>“Reactor’s still too hot. Temperature and radioactivity both too high; radioactivity’s still up around eight hundred rem’s.”</p>
			<p>“Well, then, we’ll give them all the written portion of the test together, and start the personal interviews and oral tests as soon as they’re through.” He turned to Doris Rives. “Can you give all of them the written test together?” he asked. “And can Ben help you⁠—distributing forms, timing the test, seeing that there’s no fudging, and collecting the forms when they’re done?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes; all they’ll have to do is follow the printed instructions.” She looked around. “I’ll need a desk, and an extra chair for the interview subject.”</p>
			<p>“Right over here, doctor.” Puryear said. “And here are the forms and cards, and the sound-recorder, and blank sound disks.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” Melroy added. “Be sure you get a recording of every interview and oral test; we may need them for evidence.”</p>
			<p>He broke off as a man in white coveralls came pushing into the office. He was a scrawny little fellow with a wide, loose-lipped mouth and a protuberant Adam’s apple; beside his identity badge, he wore a two-inch celluloid button lettered: <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> Steward.</p>
			<p>“Wanta use the phone,” he said. “Union business.”</p>
			<p>Melroy gestured toward a telephone on the desk beside him. The newcomer shook his head, twisting his mouth into a smirk.</p>
			<p>“Not that one; the one with the whisper mouthpiece,” he said. “This is private union business.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Melroy shrugged and indicated another phone. The man with the union steward’s badge picked it up, dialed, and held a lengthy conversation into it, turning his head away in case Melroy might happen to be a lip reader. Finally he turned.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Crandall wants to talk to you,” he said, grinning triumphantly, the phone extended to Melroy.</p>
			<p>The engineer picked up another phone, snapping a button on the base of it.</p>
			<p>“Melroy here,” he said.</p>
			<p>Something on the line started going <i>bee-beep-beep</i> softly.</p>
			<p>“Crandall, executive secretary, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>,” the man on the other end of the line identified himself. “Is there a recorder going on this line?”</p>
			<p>“Naturally,” Melroy replied. “I record all business conversations; office routine.”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy, I’ve been informed that you propose forcing our members in your employ to submit to some kind of a mental test. Is that correct?”</p>
			<p>“Not exactly. I’m not able to force anybody to submit to anything against his will. If anybody objects to taking these tests, he can say so, and I’ll have his time made out and pay him off.”</p>
			<p>“That’s the same thing. A threat of dismissal is coercion, and if these men want to keep their jobs they’ll have to take this test.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s stated more or less correctly,” Melroy conceded. “Let’s just put it that taking⁠—and passing⁠—this test is a condition of employment. My contract with your union recognizes my right to establish standards of intelligence; that’s implied by my recognized right to dismiss any person of ‘unsound mind, deficient mentality or emotional instability.’ Psychological testing is the only means of determining whether or not a person is classifiable in those terms.”</p>
			<p>“Then, in case the test purports to show that one of these men is, let’s say, mentally deficient, you intend dismissing him?”</p>
			<p>“With the customary two weeks’ severance-pay, yes.”</p>
			<p>“Well, if you do dismiss anybody on those grounds, the union will have to insist on reviewing the grounds for dismissal.”</p>
			<p>“My contract with your union says nothing whatever about any right of review being reserved by the union in such cases. Only in cases of disciplinary dismissal, which this is not. I take the position that certain minimum standards of intelligence and mental stability are essentials in this sort of work, just as, say, certain minimum standards of literacy are essential in clerical work.”</p>
			<p>“Then you’re going to make these men take these tests, whatever they are?”</p>
			<p>“If they want to work for me, yes. And anybody who fails to pass them will be dropped from my payroll.”</p>
			<p>“And who’s going to decide whether or not these men have successfully passed these tests?” Crandall asked. “You?”</p>
			<p>“Good Lord, no! I’m an electronics engineer, not a psychologist. The tests are being given, and will be evaluated, by a graduate psychologist, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr> Warren Rives, who has a diploma from the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology and is a member of the American Psychological Association. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives will be the final arbiter on who is or is not disqualified by these tests.”</p>
			<p>“Well, our man Koffler says you have some girl there to give the tests,” Crandall accused.</p>
			<p>“I suppose he means <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives,” Melroy replied. “I can assure you, she is an extremely competent psychologist, however. She came to me most highly recommended by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Karl von Heydenreich, who is not inclined to be careless with his recommendations.”</p>
			<p>“Well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy, we don’t want any more trouble with you than we have to have,” Crandall told him, “but we will insist on reviewing any dismissals which occur as a result of these tests.”</p>
			<p>“You can do that. I’d advise, first, that you read over the contract you signed with me. Get a qualified lawyer to tell you what we’ve agreed to and what we haven’t. Was there anything else you wanted to talk about.⁠ ⁠… No.⁠ ⁠… Then good morning, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Crandall.”</p>
			<p>He hung up. “All right; let’s get on with it,” he said. “Ben, you get them into the lunch room; there are enough tables and benches in there for everybody to take the written test in two relays.”</p>
			<p>“The union’s gotta be represented while these tests is going on,” the union steward announced. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Crandall says I’m to stay here an’ watch what you do to these guys.”</p>
			<p>“This man working for us?” Melroy asked Puryear.</p>
			<p>“Yes. Koffler, Julius. Electrical fitter; Joe Ricci’s gang.”</p>
			<p>“All right. See to it that he gets placed in the first relay for the written test, and gets first turn for the orals. That way he can spend the rest of his time on duty here for the union, and will know in advance what the test is like.” He turned to Koffler. “But understand this. You keep your mouth out of it. If you see anything that looks objectionable, make a note of it, but don’t try to interfere.”</p>
			<p>The written tests, done on printed forms, required about twenty minutes. Melroy watched the process of oral testing and personal interviewing for a while, then picked up a big flashlight and dropped it into his overcoat pocket, preparatory to going out to inspect some equipment that had been assembled outside the reactor area and brought in. As he went out, Koffler was straddling a chair, glowering at Doris Rives and making occasional ostentatious notes on a pad.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>For about an hour, he poked around the newly assembled apparatus, checking the wiring, and peering into it. When he returned to the temporary office, the oral testing was still going on; Koffler was still on duty as watcher for the union, but the sport had evidently palled on him, for he was now studying a comic book.</p>
			<p>Melroy left the reactor area and returned to the office in the converted area. During the midafternoon, somebody named Leighton called him from the Atomic Power Authority executive office, wanting to know what was the trouble between him and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> and saying that a protest against his alleged high-handed and arbitrary conduct had been received from the union.</p>
			<p>Melroy explained, at length. He finished: “You people have twenty Stuart tanks, and a couple of thousand soldiers and cops and undercover-men, here, guarding against sabotage. Don’t you realize that a workman who makes stupid or careless or impulsive mistakes is just as dangerous to the plant as any saboteur? If somebody shoots you through the head, it doesn’t matter whether he planned to murder you for a year or just didn’t know the gun was loaded; you’re as dead one way as the other. I should think you’d thank me for trying to eliminate a serious source of danger.”</p>
			<p>“Now, don’t misunderstand my position, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy,” the other man hastened to say. “I sympathize with your attitude, entirely. But these people are going to make trouble.”</p>
			<p>“If they do, it’ll be my trouble. I’m under contract to install this cybernetic system for you; you aren’t responsible for my labor policy,” Melroy replied. “Oh, have you had much to do with this man Crandall, yourself?”</p>
			<p>“Have I had⁠—!” Leighton sputtered for a moment. “I’m in charge of personnel, here; that makes me his top-priority target, all the time.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what sort of a character is he, anyhow? When I contracted with the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>, my lawyer and their lawyer handled everything; I never even met him.”</p>
			<p>“Well⁠—He has his job to do, the same as I have,” Leighton said. “He does it conscientiously. But it’s like this⁠—anything a workman tells him is the truth, and anything an employer tells him is a dirty lie. Until proven differently, of course, but that takes a lot of doing. And he goes off half-cocked a lot of times. He doesn’t stop to analyze situations very closely.”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I was afraid of. Well, you tell him you don’t have any control over my labor relations. Tell him to bring his gripes to me.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>At sixteen-thirty, Doris Rives came in, finding him still at his desk.</p>
			<p>“I have the written tests all finished, and I have about twenty of the tests and interviews completed,” she said. “I’ll have to evaluate the results, though. I wonder if there’s a vacant desk around here, anywhere, and a record player.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sure. Ask Joan to fix you up; she’ll find a place for you to work. And if you’re going to be working late, I’ll order some dinner for you from the cafeteria. I’m going to be here all evening, myself.”</p>
			<p>Sid Keating came in, a short while later, peeling out of his overcoat, jacket and shoulder holster.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think they got everything out of that reactor,” he said. “Radioactivity’s still almost active-normal⁠—about eight hundred rem’s⁠—and the temperature’s away up, too. That isn’t lingering radiation; that’s prompt radiation.”</p>
			<p>“Radioactivity hasn’t dropped since morning; I’d think so, too,” Melroy said. “What are they getting on the breakdown counter?”</p>
			<p>“Mostly neutrons and alpha-particles. I talked to Fred Hausinger, the maintenance boss; he doesn’t like it, either.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m no nuclear physicist,” Melroy disclaimed, “but all that alpha stuff looks like a big chunk of Pu-239 left inside. What’s Fred doing about it?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, poking around inside the reactor with telemetered scanners and remote-control equipment. When I left, he had a gang pulling out graphite blocks with RC-tongs. We probably won’t get a chance to work on it much before thirteen-hundred tomorrow.” He unzipped a bulky briefcase he had brought in under his arm and dumped papers onto his desk. “I still have this stuff to get straightened out, too.”</p>
			<p>“Had anything to eat? Then call the cafeteria and have them send up three dinners. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives is eating here, too. Find out what she wants; I want pork chops.”</p>
			<p>“Uh-huh; Li’l Abner Melroy; po’k chops unless otherwise specified.” Keating got up and went out into the middle office. As he opened the door. Melroy could hear a recording of somebody being given a word-association test.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Half an hour later, when the food arrived, they spread their table on a relatively clear desk in the middle office. Doris Rives had finished evaluating the completed tests; after dinner, she intended going over the written portions of the uncompleted tests.</p>
			<p>“How’d the finished tests come out?” Melroy asked her.</p>
			<p>“Better than I’d expected. Only two washouts,” she replied. “Harvey Burris and Julius Koffler.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, <em>no</em>!” Keating wailed. “The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> steward, and the loudest-mouthed I-know-my-rights boy on the job!”</p>
			<p>“Well, wasn’t that to be expected?” Melroy asked. “If you’d seen the act those two put on⁠—”</p>
			<p>“They’re both inherently stupid, infantile, and deficient in reasoning ability and judgment,” Doris said. “Koffler is a typical adolescent problem-child show-off type, and Burris is an almost perfect twelve-year-old schoolyard bully. They both have inferiority complexes long enough to step on. If the purpose of this test is what I’m led to believe it is, I can’t, in professional good conscience, recommend anything but that you get rid of both of them.”</p>
			<p>“What Bob’s getting at is that they’re the very ones who can claim, with the best show of plausibility, that the test is just a pretext to fire them for union activities,” Melroy explained. “And the worst of it is, they’re the only ones.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe we can scrub out a couple more on the written tests alone. Then they’ll have company,” Keating suggested.</p>
			<p>“No, I can’t do that.” Doris was firm on the point. “The written part of the test was solely for ability to reason logically. Just among the three of us, I know some university professors who’d flunk on that. But if the rest of the tests show stability, sense of responsibility, good judgment, and a tendency to think before acting, the subject can be classified as a safe and reliable workman.”</p>
			<p>“Well, then, let’s don’t say anything till we have the tests all finished,” Keating proposed.</p>
			<p>“No!” Melroy cried. “Every minute those two are on the job, there’s a chance they may do something disastrous. I’ll fire them at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“All right,” Keating shook his head. “I only work here. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>By 0930 the next morning, Keating’s forebodings began to be realized. The first intimation came with a phone call to Melroy from Crandall, who accused him of having used the psychological tests as a fraudulent pretext for discharging Koffler and Burris for union activities. When Melroy rejected his demand that the two men be reinstated, Crandall demanded to see the records of the tests.</p>
			<p>“They’re here at my office,” Melroy told him. “You’re welcome to look at them, and hear recordings of the oral portions of the tests. But I’d advise you to bring a professional psychologist along, because unless you’re a trained psychologist yourself, they’re not likely to mean much to you.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, sure!” Crandall retorted. “They’d have to be unintelligible to ordinary people, or you couldn’t get away with this frame-up! Well, don’t worry, I’ll be along to see them.”</p>
			<p>Within ten minutes, the phone rang again. This time it was Leighton, the Atomic Power Authority man.</p>
			<p>“We’re much disturbed about this dispute between your company and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>,” he began.</p>
			<p>“Well, frankly, so am I,” Melroy admitted. “I’m here to do a job, not play Hatfields and McCoys with this union. I’ve had union trouble before, and it isn’t fun. You’re the gentleman who called me last evening, aren’t you? Then you understand my position in the matter.”</p>
			<p>“Certainly, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy. I was talking to Colonel Bradshaw, the security officer, last evening. He agrees that a stupid or careless workman is, under some circumstances, a more serious threat to security than any saboteur. And we realize fully how dangerous those Doernberg-Giardanos are, and how much more dangerous they’d be if these cybernetic controls were improperly assembled. But this man Crandall is talking about calling a strike.”</p>
			<p>“Well, let him. In the first place, it’d be against me, not against the Atomic Power Authority. And, in the second place, if he does and it goes to Federal mediation, his demand for the reinstatement of those men will be thrown out, and his own organization will have to disavow his action, because he’ll be calling the strike against his own contract.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I hope so.” Leighton’s tone indicated that the hope was rather dim. “I wish you luck; you’re going to need it.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Within the hour, Crandall arrived at Melroy’s office. He was a young man; he gave Melroy the impression of having recently seen military service; probably in the Indonesian campaign of ’62 and ’63; he also seemed a little cocky and over-sure of himself.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy, we’re not going to stand for this,” he began, as soon as he came into the room. “You’re using these so-called tests as a pretext for getting rid of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Koffler and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burris because of their legitimate union activities.”</p>
			<p>“Who gave you that idea?” Melroy wanted to know. “Koffler and Burris?”</p>
			<p>“That’s the complaint they made to me, and it’s borne out by the facts,” Crandall replied. “We have on record at least half a dozen complaints that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Koffler has made to us about different unfair work-assignments, improper working conditions, inequities in allotting overtime work, and other infractions of union-shop conditions, on behalf of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Burris. So you decided to get rid of both of them, and you think you can use this clause in our contract with your company about persons of deficient intelligence. The fact is, you’re known to have threatened on several occasions to get rid of both of them.”</p>
			<p>“I am?” Melroy looked at Crandall curiously, wondering if the latter were serious, and deciding that he was. “You must believe <em>anything</em> those people tell you. Well, they lied to you if they told you that.”</p>
			<p>“Naturally that’s what you’d say,” Crandall replied. “But how do you account for the fact that those two men, and only those two men, were dismissed for alleged deficient intelligence?”</p>
			<p>“The tests aren’t all made,” Melroy replied. “Until they are, you can’t say that they are the only ones disqualified. And if you look over the records of the tests, you’ll see where Koffler and Burris failed and the others passed. Here.” He laid the pile of written-test forms and the summary and evaluation sheets on the desk. “Here’s Koffler’s, and here’s Burris’; these are the ones of the men who passed the test. Look them over if you want to.”</p>
			<p>Crandall examined the forms and summaries for the two men who had been discharged, and compared them with several random samples from the satisfactory pile.</p>
			<p>“Why, this stuff’s a lot of gibberish!” he exclaimed indignantly. “This thing, here⁠ ⁠… five Limerick oysters, six pairs of Don Alfonso tweezers, seven hundred Macedonian warriors in full battle array, eight golden crowns from the ancient, secret crypts of Egypt, nine lymphatic, sympathetic, peripatetic old men on crutches, and ten revolving heliotropes from the Ipsy-Wipsy Institute!’ Great Lord, do you actually mean that you’re using this stuff as an excuse for depriving men of their jobs?”</p>
			<p>“I warned you that you should have brought a professional psychologist along,” Melroy reminded him. “And maybe you ought to get Koffler and Burris to repeat their complaints on a lie-detector, while you’re at it. They took the same tests, in the same manner, as any of the others. They just didn’t have the mental equipment to cope with them and the others did. And for that reason, I won’t run the risk of having them working on this job.”</p>
			<p>“That’s just your word against theirs,” Crandall insisted obstinately. “Their complaint is that you framed this whole thing up to get rid of them.”</p>
			<p>“Why, I didn’t even know who either of them were, until yesterday morning.”</p>
			<p>“That’s not the way they tell it,” Crandall retorted. “They say you and Keating have been out to get them ever since they were hired. You and your supervisors have been persecuting both of those men systematically. The fact that Burris has had grounds for all these previous complaints proves that.”</p>
			<p>“It proves that Burris has a persecution complex, and that Koffler’s credulous enough to believe him,” Melroy replied. “And that tends to confirm the results of the tests they failed to pass.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, so that’s the line you’re taking. You persecute a man, and then say he has a persecution complex if he recognizes the fact. Well, you’re not going to get away with it, that’s all I have to say to you.” Crandall flung the test-sheet he had been holding on to the desk. “That stuff’s not worth the paper it’s scribbled on!” He turned on his heel in an automatically correct about-face and strode out of the office.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Melroy straightened out the papers and put them away, then sat down at his desk, filling and lighting his pipe. He was still working at 1215 when Ben Puryear called him.</p>
			<p>“They walked out on us,” he reported. “Harry Crandall was out here talking to them, and at noon the whole gang handed in their wrist-Geigers and dosimeters and cleared out their lockers. They say they aren’t coming back till Burris and Koffler come back to work with them.”</p>
			<p>“Then they aren’t coming back, period,” Melroy replied. “Crandall was to see me, a couple of hours ago. He tells me that Burris and Koffler told him that we’ve been persecuting Burris; discriminating against him. You know of anything that really happened that might make them think anything like that?”</p>
			<p>“No. Burris is always yelling about not getting enough overtime work, but you know how it is: he’s just a roustabout, a common laborer. Any overtime work that has to be done is usually skilled labor on this job. We generally have a few roustabouts to help out, but he’s been allowed to make overtime as much as any of the others.”</p>
			<p>“Will the time-records show that?”</p>
			<p>“They ought to. I don’t know what he and Koffler told Crandall, but whatever it was, I’ll bet they were lying.”</p>
			<p>“That’s all right, then. How’s the reactor, now?”</p>
			<p>“Hausinger says the count’s down to safe limits, and the temperature’s down to inactive normal. He and his gang found a big chunk of plutonium, about one-quarter <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.M.</abbr>, inside. He got it out.”</p>
			<p>“All right. Tell <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives to gather up all her completed or partially completed test records and come out to the office. You and the others stay on the job; we may have some men for you by this afternoon; tomorrow morning certainly.”</p>
			<p>He hung up, then picked up the communicator phone and called his secretary.</p>
			<p>“Joan, is Sid Keating out there? Send him in, will you?”</p>
			<p>Keating, when he entered, was wearing the lugubriously gratified expression appropriate to the successful prophet of disaster.</p>
			<p>“All right, Cassandra,” Melroy greeted him. “I’m not going to say you didn’t warn me. Look. This strike is illegal. It’s a violation of the Federal Labor Act of 1958, being called without due notice of intention, without preliminary negotiation, and without two weeks’ time-allowance.”</p>
			<p>“They’re going to claim that it isn’t a strike. They’re going to call it a ‘spontaneous work-stoppage.’ ”</p>
			<p>“Aah! I hope I can get Crandall on record to that effect; I’ll fire every one of those men for leaving their work without permission and absence from duty without leave. How many of our own men, from Pittsburgh, do we have working in these machine shops and in the assembly shop here? About sixty?”</p>
			<p>“Sixty-three. Why? You’re not going to use them to work on the reactor, are you?”</p>
			<p>“I just am. They’re all qualified cybernetics technicians; they can do this work better than this gang we’ve had to hire here. Just to be on the safe side, I’m promoting all of them, as of oh-eight-hundred this morning, to assistant gang-foremen, on salaries. That’ll take them outside union jurisdiction.”</p>
			<p>“But how about our contract with the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>?”</p>
			<p>“That’s been voided, by Crandall’s own act, in interfering with the execution of our contract with the Atomic Power Authority. You know what I think? I think the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> front office is going to have to disavow this. It’ll hurt them to do it, but they’ll have to. Crandall’s put them in the middle on this.”</p>
			<p>“How about security clearance for our own men?”</p>
			<p>“Nothing to that,” Melroy said. “Most of them are security-cleared, already, from the work we did installing that counter-rocket control system on the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.S.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Alaska</i>, and the work we did on that symbolic-logic computer for the Philadelphia Project. It may take all day to get the red tape unwound, but I think we can be ready to start by oh-eight-hundred tomorrow.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>By the time Keating had rounded up all the regular Melroy Engineering Corporation employees and Melroy had talked to Colonel Bradshaw about security-clearance, it was 1430. A little later, he was called on the phone by Leighton, the Atomic Power Authority man.</p>
			<p>“Melroy, what are you trying to do?” the Power Authority man demanded. “Get this whole plant struck shut? The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>’s madder than a shot-stung bobcat. They claim you’re going to bring in strikebreakers; they’re talking about picketing the whole reactor area.”</p>
			<p>“News gets around fast, here, doesn’t it?” Melroy commented. He told Leighton what he had in mind. The Power Authority man was considerably shaken before he had finished.</p>
			<p>“But they’ll call a strike on the whole plant! Have you any idea what that would mean?”</p>
			<p>“Certainly I have. They’ll either call it in legal form, in which case the whole thing will go to mediation and get aired, which is what I want, or they’ll pull a Pearl Harbor on you, the way they did on me. And in that case, the President will have to intervene, and they’ll fly in technicians from some of the Armed Forces plants to keep this place running. And in that case, things’ll get settled that much quicker. This Crandall thinks these men I fired are martyrs, and he’s preaching a crusade. He ought to carry an <i xml:lang="la">advocatus diaboli</i> on his payroll, to scrutinize the qualifications of his martyrs, before he starts canonizing them.”</p>
			<p>A little later, Doris Rives came into the office, her hands full of papers and cards.</p>
			<p>“I have twelve more tests completed,” she reported. “Only one washout.”</p>
			<p>Melroy laughed. “Doctor, they’re all washed out,” he told her. “It seems there was an additional test, and they all flunked it. Evinced willingness to follow unwise leadership and allow themselves to be talked into improper courses of action. You go on in to New York, and take all the test-material, including sound records, with you. Stay at the hotel⁠—your pay will go on⁠—till I need you. There’ll be a Federal Mediation hearing in a day or so.”</p>
			<p>He had two more telephone calls. The first, at 1530, was from Leighton. Melroy suspected that the latter had been medicating his morale with a couple of stiff drinks: his voice was almost jaunty.</p>
			<p>“Well, the war’s on,” he announced. “The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>’s walking out on the whole plant, at oh-eight-hundred tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“In violation of the Federal Labor Act, Section Eight, paragraphs four and five,” Melroy supplemented. “Crandall really has stuck his neck in the guillotine. What’s Washington doing?”</p>
			<p>“President Hartley is ordering Navy personnel flown in from Kennebunkport Reaction Lab; they will be here by about oh-three-hundred tomorrow. And a couple of Federal mediators are coming in to La Guardia at seventeen hundred; they’re going to hold preliminary hearings at the new Federal Building on Washington Square beginning twenty hundred. A couple of <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> negotiators are coming in from the national union headquarters at Oak Ridge: they should be getting in about the same time. You’d better be on hand, and have <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives there with you. There’s a good chance this thing may get cleared up in a day or so.”</p>
			<p>“I will undoubtedly be there, complete with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives,” Melroy replied. “It will be a pleasure!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>An hour later, Ben Puryear called from the reactor area, his voice strained with anger.</p>
			<p>“Scott, do you know what those⁠—” He gargled obscenities for a moment. “You know what they’ve done? They’ve re-packed the Number One Doernberg-Giardano; got a chain-reaction started again.”</p>
			<p>“Who?”</p>
			<p>“Fred Hausinger’s gang. Apparently at Harry Crandall’s orders. The excuse was that it would be unsafe to leave the reactor in its dismantled condition during a prolonged shutdown⁠—they were assuming, I suppose, that the strike would be allowed to proceed unopposed⁠—but of course the real reason was that they wanted to get a chain-reaction started to keep our people from working on the reactor.”</p>
			<p>“Well, didn’t Hausinger try to stop them?”</p>
			<p>“Not very hard. I asked him what he had that deputy marshal’s badge on his shirt and that Luger on his hip for, but he said he had orders not to use force, for fear of prejudicing the mediators.”</p>
			<p>Melroy swore disgustedly. “All right. Gather up all our private papers, and get Steve and Joe, and come on out. We only work here⁠—when we’re able.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Doris Rives was waiting on the street level when Melroy reached the new Federal Building, in what had formerly been the Greenwich Village district of Manhattan, that evening. She had a heavy briefcase with her, which he took.</p>
			<p>“I was afraid I’d keep you waiting,” she said. “I came down from the hotel by cab, and there was a frightful jam at Fortieth Street, and another one just below Madison Square.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it gets worse every year. Pardon my obsession, but nine times out of ten⁠—ninety-nine out of a hundred⁠—it’s the fault of some fool doing something stupid. Speaking about doing stupid things, though⁠—I did one. Forgot to take that gun out of my overcoat pocket, and didn’t notice that I had it till I was on the subway, coming in. Have a big flashlight in the other pocket, but that doesn’t matter. What I’m worried about is that somebody’ll find out I have a gun and raise a howl about my coming armed to a mediation hearing.”</p>
			<p>The hearing was to be held in one of the big conference rooms on the forty-second floor. Melroy was careful to remove his overcoat and lay it on a table in the corner, and then help Doris off with hers and lay it on top of his own. There were three men in the room when they arrived: Kenneth Leighton, the Atomic Power Authority man, fiftyish, acquiring a waistline bulge and losing his hair: a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lyons, tall and slender, with white hair; and a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Quillen, considerably younger, with plastic-rimmed glasses. The latter two were the Federal mediators. All three had been lounging in armchairs, talking about the new plays on Broadway. They all rose when Melroy and Doris Rives came over to join them.</p>
			<p>“We mustn’t discuss business until the others get here,” Leighton warned. “It’s bad enough that all three of us got here ahead of them; they’ll be sure to think we’re trying to take an unfair advantage of them. I suppose neither of you have had time to see any of the new plays.”</p>
			<p>Fortunately, Doris and Melroy had gone to the theater after dinner, the evening-before-last; they were able to join the conversation. Young <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Quillen wanted Doris Rives’ opinion, as a psychologist, of the mental processes of the heroine of the play they had seen; as nearly as she could determine, Doris replied, the heroine in question had exhibited nothing even loosely describable as mental processes of any sort. They were still on the subject when the two labor negotiators, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cronnin and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fields, arrived. Cronnin was in his sixties, with the nearsighted squint and compressed look of concentration of an old-time precision machinist; Fields was much younger, and sported a Phi Beta Kappa key.</p>
			<p>Lyons, who seemed to be the senior mediator, thereupon called the meeting to order and they took their places at the table.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Now, gentlemen⁠—and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives⁠—this will be simply an informal discussion, so that everybody can see what everybody else’s position in the matter is. We won’t bother to make a sound recording. Then, if we have managed to reach some common understanding of the question this evening, we can start the regular hearing say at thirteen hundred tomorrow. Is that agreeable?”</p>
			<p>It was. The younger mediator, Quillen, cleared his throat.</p>
			<p>“It seems, from our information, that this entire dispute arises from the discharge, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy, of two of his employees, named Koffler and Burris. Is that correct?”</p>
			<p>“Well, there’s also the question of the Melroy Engineering Corporation’s attempting to use strikebreakers, and the Long Island Atomic Power Authority’s having condoned this unfair employment practice,” Cronnin said, acidly.</p>
			<p>“And there’s also the question of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr>’s calling a Pearl Harbor strike on my company,” Melroy added.</p>
			<p>“We resent that characterization!” Cronnin retorted.</p>
			<p>“It’s a term in common usage; it denotes a strike called without warning or declaration of intention, which this was,” Melroy told him.</p>
			<p>“And there’s also the question of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> calling a general strike, in illegal manner, at the Long Island Reaction Plant,” Leighton spoke up. “On sixteen hours’ notice.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that wasn’t the fault of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> as an organization,” Fields argued. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cronnin and I are agreed that the walkout date should be postponed for two weeks, in accordance with the provisions of the Federal Labor Act.”</p>
			<p>“Well, how about my company?” Melroy wanted to know. “Your <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> members walked out on me, without any notice whatever, at twelve hundred today. Am I to consider that an act of your union, or will you disavow it so that I can fire all of them for quitting without permission?”</p>
			<p>“And how about the action of members of your union, acting on instructions from Harry Crandall, in re-packing the Number One Doernberg-Giardano breeder-reactor at our plant, after the plutonium and the U-238 and the neutron-source containers had been removed, in order to re-initiate a chain reaction to prevent <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy’s employees from working on the reactor?” Leighton demanded. “Am I to understand that the union sustains that action, too?”</p>
			<p>“I hadn’t known about that,” Fields said, somewhat startled.</p>
			<p>“Neither had I,” Cronnin added. “When did it happen?”</p>
			<p>“About sixteen hundred today,” Melroy told him.</p>
			<p>“We were on the plane from Oak Ridge, then,” Fields declared. “We know nothing about that.”</p>
			<p>“Well, are you going to take the responsibility for it, or aren’t you?” Leighton insisted.</p>
			<p>Lyons, who had been toying with a small metal paperweight, rapped on the table with it.</p>
			<p>“Gentlemen,” he interrupted. “We’re trying to cover too many subjects at once. I suggest that we confine ourselves, at the beginning, to the question of the dismissal of these men, Burris and Koffler. If we find that the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> has a legitimate grievance in what we may call the Burris-Koffler question, we can settle that and then go on to these other questions.”</p>
			<p>“I’m agreeable to that,” Melroy said.</p>
			<p>“So are we,” Cronnin nodded.</p>
			<p>“All right, then. Since the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> is the complaining party in this question, perhaps you gentlemen should state the grounds for your complaints.”</p>
			<p>Fields and Cronnin exchanged glances: Cronnin nodded to Fields and the latter rose. The two employees in question, he stated, had been the victims of discrimination and persecution because of union activities. Koffler was the union shop-steward for the men employed by the Melroy Engineering Corporation, and Burris had been active in bringing complaints about unfair employment practices. Furthermore, it was the opinion of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.F.A.W.</abbr> that the psychological tests imposed on their members had been a fraudulent pretext for dismissing these two men, and, in any case, the practice of compelling workers to submit to such tests was insulting, degrading, and not a customary condition of employment.</p>
			<p>With that, he sat down. Melroy was on his feet at once.</p>
			<p>“I’ll deny those statements, categorically and seriatim,” he replied. “They are based entirely upon misrepresentations made by the two men who were disqualified by the tests and dropped from my payroll because of being, in the words of my contract with your union, ‘persons of unsound mind, deficient intelligence and/or emotional instability.’ What happened is that your local official, Crandall, accepted everything they told him uncritically, and you accepted everything Crandall told you, in the same spirit.</p>
			<p>“Before I go on,” Melroy continued, turning to Lyons, “have I your permission to let <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives explain about these tests, herself, and tell how they were given and evaluated?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Permission granted by Lyons, Doris Rives rose. At some length, she explained the nature and purpose of the tests, and her method of scoring and correlating them.</p>
			<p>“Well, did <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy suggest to you that any specific employee or employees of his were undesirable and ought to be eliminated?” Fields asked.</p>
			<p>“Certainly not!” Doris Rives became angry. “And if he had, I’d have taken the first plane out of here. That suggestion is insulting! And for your information, I never met <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy before day-before-yesterday afternoon; I am not dependent upon him for anything; I took this job as an accommodation to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Karl von Heydenreich, who ordinarily does such work for the Melroy company, and I’m losing money by remaining here. Does that satisfy you?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it does,” Fields admitted. He was obviously impressed by mention of the distinguished Austrian psychologist’s name. “If I may ask <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Melroy a question: I gather that these tests are given to all your employees. Why do you demand such an extraordinary level of intelligence from your employees, even common laborers?”</p>
			<p>“Extraordinary?” Melroy echoed. “If the standards established by those tests are extraordinary, then God help this country; we are becoming a race of morons! I’ll leave that statement to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives for confirmation; she’s already pointed out that all that is required to pass those tests is ordinary adult mental capacity.</p>
			<p>“My company specializes in cybernetic-control systems,” he continued. “In spite of a lot of misleading colloquial jargon about ‘thinking machines’ and ‘giant brains,’ a cybernetic system doesn’t really think. It only does what it’s been designed <em>and built</em> to do, and if somebody builds a mistake into it, it will automatically and infallibly repeat that mistake in practice.”</p>
			<p>“He’s right,” Cronnin said. “The men that build a machine like that have got to be as smart as the machine’s supposed to be, or the machine’ll be as dumb as they are.”</p>
			<p>Fields turned on him angrily. “Which side are you supposed to be on, anyhow?” he demanded.</p>
			<p>“You’re probably a lawyer,” Melroy said. “But I’ll bet <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cronnin’s an old reaction-plant man.” Cronnin nodded unthinkingly in confirmation. “All right, then. Ask him what those Doernberg-Giardanos are like. And then let me ask you: Suppose some moron fixed up something that would go wrong, or made the wrong kind of a mistake himself, around one of those reactors?”</p>
			<p>It was purely a rhetorical question, but, much later, when he would have time to think about it, Scott Melroy was to wonder if ever in history such a question had been answered so promptly and with such dramatic calamitousness.</p>
			<p>Three seconds after he stopped speaking, the lights went out.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>For a moment, they were silent and motionless. Then somebody across the table from Melroy began to say, “What the devil⁠—?” Doris Rives, beside him, clutched his arm. At the head of the table, Lyons was fuming impatiently, and Kenneth Leighton snapped a pocket-lighter and held it up.</p>
			<p>The Venetian-screened windows across the room faced east. In the flicker of the lighter, Melroy made his way around to them and drew open the slats of one, looking out. Except for the headlights of cars, far down in the street, and the lights of ships in the harbor, the city was completely blacked out. But there was one other, horrible, light far away at the distant tip of Long Island⁠—a huge ball of flame, floating upward at the tip of a column of fiery gas. As he watched, there were twinkles of unbearable brightness at the base of the pillar of fire, spreading into awesome sheet-flashes, and other fireballs soared up. Then the sound and the shock-wave of the first blast reached them.</p>
			<p>“The main power-reactors, too,” Melroy said to himself, not realizing that he spoke audibly. “Too well shielded for the blast to get them, but the heat melted the fissionables down to critical mass.”</p>
			<p>Leighton, the lighter still burning, was beside him, now.</p>
			<p>“That’s not⁠—God, it can’t be anything else! Why, the whole plant’s gone! There aren’t enough other generators in this area to handle a hundredth of the demand.”</p>
			<p>“And don’t blame that on my alleged strikebreakers,” Melroy warned. “They hadn’t got security-cleared to enter the reactor area when this happened.”</p>
			<p>“What do you think happened?” Cronnin asked. “One of the Doernberg-Giardanos let go?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. Your man Crandall. If he survived that, it’s his bad luck,” Melroy said grimly. “Last night, while Fred Hausinger was pulling the fissionables and radioactives out of the Number One breeder, he found a big nugget of Pu-239, about one-quarter <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.M.</abbr> I don’t know what was done with it, but I do know that Crandall had the maintenance gang repack that reactor, to keep my people from working on it. Nobody’ll ever find out just what happened, but they were in a hurry; they probably shoved things in any old way. Somehow, that big subcritical nugget must have got back in, and the breeding-cans, which were pretty ripe by that time, must have been shoved in too close to it and to one another. You know how fast those <abbr>D-G</abbr>’s work. It just took this long to build up <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.M.</abbr> for a bomb-type reaction. You remember what I was saying before the lights went out? Well, it happened. Some moron⁠—some untested and undetected moron⁠—made the wrong kind of a mistake.”</p>
			<p>“Too bad about Crandall. He was a good kid, only he didn’t stop to think often enough,” Cronnin said. “Well, I guess the strike’s off, now; that’s one thing.”</p>
			<p>“But all those people, out there!” Womanlike, Doris Rives was thinking particularly rather than generally and of humans rather than abstractions. “It must have killed everybody for miles around.”</p>
			<p>Sid Keating, Melroy thought. And Joe Ricci, and Ben Puryear, and Steve Chalmers, and all the workmen whom he had brought here from Pittsburgh, to their death. Then he stopped thinking about them. It didn’t do any good to think of men who’d been killed; he’d learned that years ago, as a kid second lieutenant in Korea. The people to think about were the millions in Greater New York, and up the Hudson Valley to Albany, and as far south as Trenton, caught without light in the darkness, without heat in the dead of winter, without power in subways and skyscrapers and on railroads and interurban lines.</p>
			<p>He turned to the woman beside him.</p>
			<p>“Doris, before you could get your Board of Psychiatry and Neurology diploma, you had to qualify as a regular <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.D.</abbr>, didn’t you?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Why, yes⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Then you’d better report to the nearest hospital. Any doctor at all is going to be desperately needed, for the next day or so. Me, I still have a reserve major’s commission in the Army Corps of Engineers. They’re probably calling up reserve officers, with any radios that are still working. Until I hear differently, I’m ordering myself on active duty as of now.” He looked around. “Anybody know where the nearest Army headquarters is?”</p>
			<p>“There’s a recruiting station down on the thirty-something floor,” Quillen said. “It’s probably closed, now, though.”</p>
			<p>“Ground Defense Command; Midtown City,” Leighton said. “They have a medical section of their own; they’ll be glad to get <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Rives, too.”</p>
			<p>Melroy helped her on with her coat and handed her her handbag, then shrugged into his own overcoat and belted it about him, the weight of the flashlight and the automatic sagging the pockets. He’d need both, the gun as much as the light⁠—New York had more than its share of vicious criminals, to whom this power-failure would be a perfect devilsend. Handing Doris the light, he let her take his left arm. Together, they left the room and went down the hallway to the stairs and the long walk to the darkened street below, into a city that had suddenly been cut off from its very life-energy. A city that had put all its eggs in one basket, and left the basket in the path of any blundering foot.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Dearest</h2>
			<p>Colonel Ashley Hampton chewed his cigar and forced himself to relax, his glance slowly traversing the room, lingering on the mosaic of book-spines in the tall cases, the sunlight splashed on the faded pastel colors of the carpet, the soft-tinted autumn landscape outside the French windows, the trophies of Indian and Filipino and German weapons on the walls. He could easily feign relaxation here in the library of Greyrock, as long as he looked only at these familiar inanimate things and avoided the five people gathered in the room with him, for all of them were enemies.</p>
			<p>There was his nephew, Stephen Hampton, greying at the temples but youthfully dressed in sports-clothes, leaning with obvious if slightly premature proprietorship against the fireplace, a whiskey-and-soda in his hand. There was Myra, Stephen’s smart, sophisticated-looking blonde wife, reclining in a chair beside the desk. For these two, he felt an implacable hatred. The others were no less enemies, perhaps more dangerous enemies, but they were only the tools of Stephen and Myra. For instance, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell, prim and self-satisfied, sitting on the edge of his chair and clutching the briefcase on his lap as though it were a restless pet which might attempt to escape. He was an honest man, as lawyers went; painfully ethical. No doubt he had convinced himself that his clients were acting from the noblest and most disinterested motives. And Doctor Alexis Vehrner, with his Vandyke beard and his Viennese accent as phony as a Soviet-controlled election, who had preempted the chair at Colonel Hampton’s desk. That rankled the old soldier, but Doctor Vehrner would want to assume the position which would give him appearance of commanding the situation, and he probably felt that Colonel Hampton was no longer the master of Greyrock. The fifth, a Neanderthal type in a white jacket, was Doctor Vehrner’s attendant and bodyguard; he could be ignored, like an enlisted man unthinkingly obeying the orders of a superior.</p>
			<p>“But you are not cooperating, Colonel Hampton,” the psychiatrist complained. “How can I help you if you do not cooperate?”</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton took the cigar from his mouth. His white mustache, tinged a faint yellow by habitual smoking, twitched angrily.</p>
			<p>“Oh; you call it helping me, do you?” he asked acidly.</p>
			<p>“But why else am I here?” the doctor parried.</p>
			<p>“You’re here because my loving nephew and his charming wife can’t wait to see me buried in the family cemetery; they want to bury me alive in that private Bedlam of yours,” Colonel Hampton replied.</p>
			<p>“See!” Myra Hampton turned to the psychiatrist. “We are <em>persecuting</em> him! We are all <em>envious</em> of him! We are <em>plotting against</em> him!”</p>
			<p>“Of course; this sullen and suspicious silence is a common paranoid symptom; one often finds such symptoms in cases of senile dementia,” Doctor Vehrner agreed.</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton snorted contemptuously. Senile dementia! Well, he must have been senile and demented, to bring this pair of snakes into his home, because he felt an obligation to his dead brother’s memory. And he’d willed Greyrock, and his money, and everything, to Stephen. Only Myra couldn’t wait till he died; she’d Lady-Macbethed her husband into this insanity accusation.</p>
			<p>“… however, I must fully satisfy myself, before I can sign the commitment,” the psychiatrist was saying. “After all, the patient is a man of advanced age. Seventy-eight, to be exact.”</p>
			<p>Seventy-eight; almost eighty. Colonel Hampton could hardly realize that he had been around so long. He had been a little boy, playing soldiers. He had been a young man, breaking the family tradition of Harvard and wangling an appointment to West Point. He had been a new second lieutenant at a little post in Wyoming, in the last dying flicker of the Indian Wars. He had been a first lieutenant, trying to make soldiers of militiamen and hoping for orders to Cuba before the Spaniards gave up. He had been the hard-bitten captain of a hard-bitten company, fighting Moros in the jungles of Mindanao. Then, through the early years of the Twentieth Century, after his father’s death, he had been that rara avis in the American service, a really wealthy professional officer. He had played polo, and served a turn as military attaché at the Paris embassy. He had commanded a regiment in France in 1918, and in the postwar years, had rounded out his service in command of a regiment of Negro cavalry, before retiring to Greyrock. Too old for active service, or even a desk at the Pentagon, he had drilled a Home Guard company of 4-Fs and boys and paunchy middle-agers through the Second World War. Then he had been an old man, sitting alone in the sunlight⁠ ⁠… until a wonderful thing had happened.</p>
			<p>“Get him to tell you about this invisible playmate of his,” Stephen suggested. “If that won’t satisfy you, I don’t know what will.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It had begun a year ago last June. He had been sitting on a bench on the east lawn, watching a kitten playing with a crumpled bit of paper on the walk, circling warily around it as though it were some living prey, stalking cautiously, pouncing and striking the paper ball with a paw and then pursuing it madly. The kitten, whose name was Smokeball, was a friend of his; soon she would tire of her game and jump up beside him to be petted.</p>
			<p>Then suddenly, he seemed to hear a girl’s voice beside him:</p>
			<p>“Oh, what a darling little cat! What’s its name?”</p>
			<p>“Smokeball,” he said, without thinking. “She’s about the color of a shrapnel-burst.⁠ ⁠…” Then he stopped short, looking about. There was nobody in sight, and he realized that the voice had been inside his head rather than in his ear.</p>
			<p>“What the devil?” he asked himself. “Am I going nuts?”</p>
			<p>There was a happy little laugh inside of him, like bubbles rising in a glass of champagne.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no; I’m really here,” the voice, inaudible but mentally present, assured him. “You can’t see me, or touch me, or even really hear me, but I’m not something you just imagined. I’m just as real as⁠ ⁠… as Smokeball, there. Only I’m a different kind of reality. Watch.”</p>
			<p>The voice stopped, and something that had seemed to be close to him left him. Immediately, the kitten stopped playing with the crumpled paper and cocked her head to one side, staring fixedly as at something above her. He’d seen cats do that before⁠—stare wide-eyed and entranced, as though at something wonderful which was hidden from human eyes. Then, still looking up and to the side, Smokeball trotted over and jumped onto his lap, but even as he stroked her, she was looking at an invisible something beside him. At the same time, he had a warm and pleasant feeling, as of a happy and affectionate presence near him.</p>
			<p>“No,” he said, slowly and judicially. “That’s not just my imagination. But who⁠—or what⁠—are you?”</p>
			<p>“I’m.⁠ ⁠… Oh, I don’t know how to think it so that you’ll understand.” The voice inside his head seemed baffled, like a physicist trying to explain atomic energy to a Hottentot. “I’m not material. If you can imagine a mind that doesn’t need a brain to think with.⁠ ⁠… Oh, I can’t explain it now! But when I’m talking to you, like this, I’m really thinking inside your brain, along with your own mind, and you hear the words without there being any sound. And you just don’t know any words that would express it.”</p>
			<p>He had never thought much, one way or another, about spiritualism. There had been old people, when he had been a boy, who had told stories of ghosts and apparitions, with the firmest conviction that they were true. And there had been an Irishman, in his old company in the Philippines, who swore that the ghost of a dead comrade walked post with him when he was on guard.</p>
			<p>“Are you a spirit?” he asked. “I mean, somebody who once lived in a body, like me?”</p>
			<p>“N-no.” The voice inside him seemed doubtful. “That is, I don’t think so. I know about spirits; they’re all around, everywhere. But I don’t think I’m one. At least, I’ve always been like I am now, as long as I can remember. Most spirits don’t seem to sense me. I can’t reach most living people, either; their minds are closed to me, or they have such disgusting minds I can’t bear to touch them. Children are open to me, but when they tell their parents about me, they are laughed at, or punished for lying, and then they close up against me. You’re the first grown-up person I’ve been able to reach for a long time.”</p>
			<p>“Probably getting into my second childhood,” Colonel Hampton grunted.</p>
			<p>“Oh, but you mustn’t be ashamed of that!” the invisible entity told him. “That’s the beginning of real wisdom⁠—becoming childlike again. One of your religious teachers said something like that, long ago, and a long time before that, there was a Chinaman whom people called Venerable Child, because his wisdom had turned back again to a child’s simplicity.”</p>
			<p>“That was Lao Tze,” Colonel Hampton said, a little surprised. “Don’t tell me you’ve been around that long.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, but I have! Longer than that; oh, for very long.” And yet the voice he seemed to be hearing was the voice of a young girl. “You don’t mind my coming to talk to you?” it continued. “I get so lonely, so dreadfully lonely, you see.”</p>
			<p>“Urmh! So do I,” Colonel Hampton admitted. “I’m probably going bats, but what the hell? It’s a nice way to go bats, I’ll say that.⁠ ⁠… Stick around; whoever you are, and let’s get acquainted. I sort of like you.”</p>
			<p>A feeling of warmth suffused him, as though he had been hugged by someone young and happy and loving.</p>
			<p>“Oh, I’m glad. I like you, too; you’re nice!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Yes, of course.” Doctor Vehrner nodded sagely. “That is a schizoid tendency; the flight from reality into a dreamworld peopled by creatures of the imagination. You understand, there is usually a mixture of psychotic conditions, in cases like this. We will say that this case begins with simple senile dementia⁠—physical brain degeneration, a result of advanced age. Then the paranoid symptoms appear; he imagines himself surrounded by envious enemies, who are conspiring against him. The patient then withdraws into himself, and in his self-imposed isolation, he conjures up imaginary companionship. I have no doubt.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>In the beginning, he had suspected that this unseen visitor was no more than a figment of his own lonely imagination, but as the days passed, this suspicion vanished. Whatever this entity might be, an entity it was, entirely distinct from his own conscious or subconscious mind.</p>
			<p>At first she⁠—he had early come to think of the being as feminine⁠—had seemed timid, fearful lest her intrusions into his mind prove a nuisance. It took some time for him to assure her that she was always welcome. With time, too, his impression of her grew stronger and more concrete. He found that he was able to visualize her, as he might visualize something remembered, or conceived of in imagination⁠—a lovely young girl, slender and clothed in something loose and filmy, with flowers in her honey-colored hair, and clear blue eyes, a pert, cheerful face, a wide, smiling mouth and an impudently up-tilted nose. He realized that this image was merely a sort of allegorical representation, his own private object-abstraction from a reality which his senses could never picture as it existed.</p>
			<p>It was about this time that he had begun to call her Dearest. She had given him no name, and seemed quite satisfied with that one.</p>
			<p>“I’ve been thinking,” she said, “I ought to have a name for you, too. Do you mind if I call you Popsy?”</p>
			<p>“Huh?” He had been really startled at that. If he needed any further proof of Dearest’s independent existence, that was it. Never, in the uttermost depths of his subconscious, would he have been likely to label himself Popsy. “Know what they used to call me in the Army?” he asked. “Slaughterhouse Hampton. They claimed I needed a truckload of sawdust to follow me around and cover up the blood.” He chuckled. “Nobody but you would think of calling me Popsy.”</p>
			<p>There was a price, he found, that he must pay for Dearest’s companionship⁠—the price of eternal vigilance. He found that he was acquiring the habit of opening doors and then needlessly standing aside to allow her to precede him. And, although she insisted that he need not speak aloud to her, that she could understand any thought which he directed to her, he could not help actually pronouncing the words, if only in a faint whisper. He was glad that he had learned, before the end of his plebe year at West Point, to speak without moving his lips.</p>
			<p>Besides himself and the kitten, Smokeball, there was one other at Greyrock who was aware, if only faintly, of Dearest’s presence. That was old Sergeant Williamson, the Colonel’s Negro servant, a retired first sergeant from the regiment he had last commanded. With increasing frequency, he would notice the old Negro pause in his work, as though trying to identify something too subtle for his senses, and then shake his head in bewilderment.</p>
			<p>One afternoon in early October⁠—just about a year ago⁠—he had been reclining in a chair on the west veranda, smoking a cigar and trying to recreate, for his companion, a mental picture of an Indian camp as he had seen it in Wyoming in the middle ’90’s, when Sergeant Williamson came out from the house, carrying a pair of the Colonel’s field-boots and a polishing-kit. Unaware of the Colonel’s presence, he set down his burden, squatted on the floor and began polishing the boots, humming softly to himself. Then he must have caught a whiff of the Colonel’s cigar. Raising his head, he saw the Colonel, and made as though to pick up the boots and polishing equipment.</p>
			<p>“Oh, that’s all right, Sergeant,” the Colonel told him. “Carry on with what you’re doing. There’s room enough for both of us here.”</p>
			<p>“Yessuh; thank yo,’ suh.” The old ex-sergeant resumed his soft humming, keeping time with the brush in his hand.</p>
			<p>“You know, Popsy, I think he knows I’m here,” Dearest said. “Nothing definite, of course; he just feels there’s something here that he can’t see.”</p>
			<p>“I wonder. I’ve noticed something like that. Funny, he doesn’t seem to mind, either. Colored people are usually scary about ghosts and spirits and the like.⁠ ⁠… I’m going to ask him.” He raised his voice. “Sergeant, do you seem to notice anything peculiar around here, lately?”</p>
			<p>The repetitious little two-tone melody broke off short. The soldier-servant lifted his face and looked into the Colonel’s. His brow wrinkled, as though he were trying to express a thought for which he had no words.</p>
			<p>“Yo’ notice dat, too, suh?” he asked. “Why, yessuh, Cunnel; Ah don’ know ’zackly how t’ say hit, but dey is som’n, at dat. Hit seems like⁠ ⁠… like a kinda⁠ ⁠… a kinda <em>blessedness</em>.” He chuckled. “Dat’s hit, Cunnel; dey’s a blessedness. Wondeh iffen Ah’s gittin’ r’ligion, now?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Well, all this is very interesting, I’m sure, Doctor,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell was saying, polishing his glasses on a piece of tissue and keeping one elbow on his briefcase at the same time. “But really, it’s not getting us anywhere, so to say. You know, we must have that commitment signed by you. Now, is it or is it not your opinion that this man is of unsound mind?”</p>
			<p>“Now, have patience, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Powell,” the psychiatrist soothed him. “You must admit that as long as this gentleman refuses to talk, I cannot be said to have interviewed him.”</p>
			<p>“What if he won’t talk?” Stephen Hampton burst out. “We’ve told you about his behavior; how he sits for hours mumbling to this imaginary person he thinks is with him, and how he always steps aside when he opens a door, to let somebody who isn’t there go through ahead of him, and how.⁠ ⁠… Oh, hell, what’s the use? If he were in his right mind, he’d speak up and try to prove it, wouldn’t he? What do you say, Myra?”</p>
			<p>Myra was silent, and Colonel Hampton found himself watching her with interest. Her mouth had twisted into a wry grimace, and she was clutching the arms of her chair until her knuckles whitened. She seemed to be in some intense pain. Colonel Hampton hoped she were; preferably with something slightly fatal.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Sergeant Williamson’s suspicion that he might be getting religion became a reality, for a time, that winter, after The Miracle.</p>
			<p>It had been a blustery day in mid-January, with a high wind driving swirls of snow across the fields, and Colonel Hampton, fretting indoors for several days, decided to go out and fill his lungs with fresh air. Bundled warmly, swinging his blackthorn cane, he had set out, accompanied by Dearest, to tramp cross-country to the village, three miles from Greyrock. They had enjoyed the walk through the white windswept desolation, the old man and his invisible companion, until the accident had happened.</p>
			<p>A sheet of glassy ice had lain treacherously hidden under a skift of snow; when he stepped upon it, his feet shot from under him, the stick flew from his hand, and he went down. When he tried to rise, he found that he could not. Dearest had been almost frantic.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Popsy, you must get up!” she cried. “You’ll freeze if you don’t. Come on, Popsy; try again!”</p>
			<p>He tried, in vain. His old body would not obey his will.</p>
			<p>“It’s no use, Dearest; I can’t. Maybe it’s just as well,” he said. “Freezing’s an easy death, and you say people live on as spirits, after they die. Maybe we can always be together, now.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know. I don’t want you to die yet, Popsy. I never was able to get through to a spirit, and I’m afraid.⁠ ⁠… Wait! Can you crawl a little? Enough to get over under those young pines?”</p>
			<p>“I think so.” His left leg was numb, and he believed that it was broken. “I can try.”</p>
			<p>He managed to roll onto his back, with his head toward the clump of pine seedlings. Using both hands and his right heel, he was able to propel himself slowly through the snow until he was out of the worst of the wind.</p>
			<p>“That’s good; now try to cover yourself,” Dearest advised. “Put your hands in your coat pockets. And wait here; I’ll try to get help.”</p>
			<p>Then she left him. For what seemed a long time, he lay motionless in the scant protection of the young pines, suffering miserably. He began to grow drowsy. As soon as he realized what was happening, he was frightened, and the fright pulled him awake again. Soon he felt himself drowsing again. By shifting his position, he caused a jab of pain from his broken leg, which brought him back to wakefulness. Then the deadly drowsiness returned.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>This time, he was wakened by a sharp voice, mingled with a throbbing sound that seemed part of a dream of the cannonading in the Argonne.</p>
			<p>“Dah! Look-a dah!” It was, he realized, Sergeant Williamson’s voice. “Gittin’ soft in de haid, is Ah, yo’ ol’ wuthless no-’count?”</p>
			<p>He turned his face, to see the battered jeep from Greyrock, driven by Arthur, the stableman and gardener, with Sergeant Williamson beside him. The older Negro jumped to the ground and ran toward him. At the same time, he felt Dearest with him again.</p>
			<p>“We made it, Popsy! We made it!” she was exulting. “I was afraid I’d never make him understand, but I did. And you should have seen him bully that other man into driving the jeep. Are you all right, Popsy?”</p>
			<p>“Is yo’ all right, Cunnel?” Sergeant Williamson was asking.</p>
			<p>“My leg’s broken, I think, but outside of that I’m all right,” he answered both of them. “How did you happen to find me, Sergeant?”</p>
			<p>The old Negro soldier rolled his eyes upward. “Cunnel, hit war a mi’acle of de blessed Lawd!” he replied, solemnly. “An angel of de Lawd done appeahed unto me.” He shook his head slowly. “Ah’s a sinful man, Cunnel; Ah couldn’t see de angel face to face, but de glory of de angel was befoh me, an’ guided me.”</p>
			<p>They used his cane and a broken-off bough to splint the leg; they wrapped him in a horse-blanket and hauled him back to Greyrock and put him to bed, with Dearest clinging solicitously to him. The fractured leg knit slowly, though the physician was amazed at the speed with which, considering his age, he made recovery, and with his unfailing cheerfulness. He did not know, of course, that he was being assisted by an invisible nurse. For all that, however, the leaves on the oaks around Greyrock were green again before Colonel Hampton could leave his bed and hobble about the house on a cane.</p>
			<p>Arthur, the young Negro who had driven the jeep, had become one of the most solid pillars of the little <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">A.M.E.</abbr> church beyond the village, as a result. Sergeant Williamson had also become an attendant at church for a while, and then stopped. Without being able to define, or spell, or even pronounce the term, Sergeant Williamson was a strict pragmatist. Most Africans are, even five generations removed from the slave-ship that brought their forefathers from the Dark Continent. And Sergeant Williamson could not find the blessedness at the church. Instead, it seemed to center about the room where his employer and former regiment commander lay. That, to his mind, was quite reasonable. If an Angel of the Lord was going to tarry upon earth, the celestial being would naturally prefer the society of a retired <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.A.</abbr> colonel to that of a passel of triflin,’ no-’counts at an ol’ clapboard church house. Be that as it may, he could always find the blessedness in Colonel Hampton’s room, and sometimes, when the Colonel would be asleep, the blessedness would follow him out and linger with him for a while.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Colonel Hampton wondered, anxiously, where Dearest was, now. He had not felt her presence since his nephew had brought his lawyer and the psychiatrist into the house. He wondered if she had voluntarily separated herself from him for fear he might give her some sign of recognition that these harpies would fasten upon as an evidence of unsound mind. He could not believe that she had deserted him entirely, now when he needed her most.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>“Well, what can I do?” Doctor Vehrner was complaining. “You bring me here to interview him, and he just sits there and does nothing.⁠ ⁠… Will you consent to my giving him an injection of sodium pentathol?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I don’t know, now,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell objected. “I’ve heard of that drug⁠—one of the so-called ‘truth-serum’ drugs. I doubt if testimony taken under its influence would be admissible in a court.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“This is not a court, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Powell,” the doctor explained patiently. “And I am not taking testimony; I am making a diagnosis. Pentathol is a recognized diagnostic agent.”</p>
			<p>“Go ahead,” Stephen Hampton said. “Anything to get this over with.⁠ ⁠… You agree, Myra?”</p>
			<p>Myra said nothing. She simply sat, with staring eyes, and clutched the arms of her chair as though to keep from slipping into some dreadful abyss. Once a low moan escaped from her lips.</p>
			<p>“My wife is naturally overwrought by this painful business,” Stephen said. “I trust that you gentlemen will excuse her.⁠ ⁠… Hadn’t you better go and lie down somewhere, Myra?”</p>
			<p>She shook her head violently, moaning again. Both the doctor and the attorney were looking at her curiously.</p>
			<p>“Well, I object to being drugged,” Colonel Hampton said, rising. “And what’s more, I won’t submit to it.”</p>
			<p>“Albert!” Doctor Vehrner said sharply, nodding toward the Colonel. The pithecanthropoid attendant in the white jacket hastened forward, pinned his arms behind him and dragged him down into the chair. For an instant, the old man tried to resist, then, realizing the futility and undignity of struggling, subsided. The psychiatrist had taken a leather case from his pocket and was selecting a hypodermic needle.</p>
			<p>Then Myra Hampton leaped to her feet, her face working hideously.</p>
			<p>“No! Stop! Stop!” she cried.</p>
			<p>Everybody looked at her in surprise, Colonel Hampton no less than the others. Stephen Hampton called out her name sharply.</p>
			<p>“No! You shan’t do this to me! You shan’t! You’re torturing me! you are all devils!” she screamed. “Devils! <em>Devils!</em>”</p>
			<p>“Myra!” her husband barked, stepping forward.</p>
			<p>With a twist, she eluded him, dashing around the desk and pulling open a drawer.</p>
			<p>For an instant, she fumbled inside it, and when she brought her hand up, she had Colonel Hampton’s .45 automatic in it. She drew back the slide and released it, loading the chamber.</p>
			<p>Doctor Vehrner, the hypodermic in his hand, turned. Stephen Hampton sprang at her, dropping his drink. And Albert, the prognathous attendant, released Colonel Hampton and leaped at the woman with the pistol, with the unthinking promptness of a dog whose master is in danger.</p>
			<p>Stephen Hampton was the closest to her; she shot him first, point-blank in the chest. The heavy bullet knocked him backward against a small table; he and it fell over together. While he was falling, the woman turned, dipped the muzzle of her pistol slightly and fired again; Doctor Vehrner’s leg gave way under him and he went down, the hypodermic flying from his hand and landing at Colonel Hampton’s feet. At the same time, the attendant, Albert, was almost upon her. Quickly, she reversed the heavy Colt, pressed the muzzle against her heart, and fired a third shot.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell had let the briefcase slip to the floor; he was staring, slack-jawed, at the tableau of violence which had been enacted before him. The attendant, having reached Myra, was looking down at her stupidly. Then he stooped, and straightened.</p>
			<p>“She’s dead!” he said, unbelievingly.</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton rose, putting his heel on the hypodermic and crushing it.</p>
			<p>“Of course she’s dead!” he barked. “You have any first-aid training? Then look after these other people. Doctor Vehrner first; the other man’s unconscious; he’ll wait.”</p>
			<p>“No; look after the other man first,” Doctor Vehrner said.</p>
			<p>Albert gaped back and forth between them.</p>
			<p>“Goddammit, you heard me!” Colonel Hampton roared. It was Slaughterhouse Hampton, whose service-ribbons started with the Indian campaigns, speaking; an officer who never for an instant imagined that his orders would not be obeyed. “Get a tourniquet on that man’s leg, you!” He moderated his voice and manner about half a degree and spoke to Vehrner. “You are not the doctor, you’re the patient, now. You’ll do as you’re told. Don’t you know that a man shot in the leg with a .45 can bleed to death without half trying?”</p>
			<p>“Yo’-all do like de Cunnel says, ’r foh Gawd, yo’-all gwine wish yo’ had,” Sergeant Williamson said, entering the room. “Git a move on.”</p>
			<p>He stood just inside the doorway, holding a silver-banded malacca walking-stick that he had taken from the hall-stand. He was grasping it in his left hand, below the band, with the crook out, holding it at his side as though it were a sword in a scabbard, which was exactly what that walking-stick was. Albert looked at him, and then back at Colonel Hampton. Then, whipping off his necktie, he went down on his knees beside Doctor Vehrner, skillfully applying the improvised tourniquet, twisting it tight with an eighteen-inch ruler the Colonel took from the desk and handed to him.</p>
			<p>“Go get the first-aid kit, Sergeant,” the Colonel said. “And hurry. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen’s been shot, too.”</p>
			<p>“Yessuh!” Sergeant Williamson executed an automatic salute and about-face and raced from the room. The Colonel picked up the telephone on the desk.</p>
			<p>The County Hospital was three miles from Greyrock; the State Police substation a good five. He dialed the State Police number first.</p>
			<p>“Sergeant Mallard? Colonel Hampton, at Greyrock. We’ve had a little trouble here. My nephew’s wife just went <i xml:lang="es">juramentado</i> with one of my pistols, shot and wounded her husband and another man, and then shot and killed herself.⁠ ⁠… Yes, indeed it is, Sergeant. I wish you’d send somebody over here, as soon as possible, to take charge.⁠ ⁠… Oh, you will? That’s good.⁠ ⁠… No, it’s all over, and nobody to arrest; just the formalities.⁠ ⁠… Well, thank you, Sergeant.”</p>
			<p>The old Negro cavalryman reentered the room, without the sword-cane and carrying a heavy leather box on a strap over his shoulder. He set this on the floor and opened it, then knelt beside Stephen Hampton. The Colonel was calling the hospital.</p>
			<p>“… gunshot wounds,” he was saying. “One man in the chest and the other in the leg, both with a .45 pistol. And you’d better send a doctor who’s qualified to write a death certificate; there was a woman killed, too.⁠ ⁠… Yes, certainly; the State Police have been notified.”</p>
			<p>“Dis ain’ so bad, Cunnel,” Sergeant Williamson raised his head to say. “Ah’s seen men shot wuss’n dis dat was ma’ked ‘Duty’ inside a month, suh.”</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton nodded. “Well, get him fixed up as best you can, till the ambulance gets here. And there’s whiskey and glasses on that table, over there. Better give Doctor Vehrner a drink.” He looked at <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell, still frozen to his chair, aghast at the carnage around him. “And give <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Powell a drink, too. He needs one.”</p>
			<p>He did, indeed. Colonel Hampton could have used a drink, too; the library looked like beef-day at an Indian agency. But he was still Slaughterhouse Hampton, and consequently could not afford to exhibit queasiness.</p>
			<p>It was then, for the first time since the business had started that he felt the presence of Dearest.</p>
			<p>“Oh, Popsy, are you all right?” the voice inside his head was asking. “It’s all over, now; you won’t have anything to worry about, any more. But, oh, I was afraid I wouldn’t be able to do it!”</p>
			<p>“My God, Dearest!” He almost spoke aloud. “Did you make her do that?”</p>
			<p>“Popsy!” The voice in his mind was grief-stricken. “You.⁠ ⁠… You’re afraid of me! Never be afraid of Dearest, Popsy! And don’t hate me for this. It was the only thing I could do. If he’d given you that injection, he could have made you tell him all about us, and then he’d have been sure you were crazy, and they’d have taken you away. And they treat people dreadfully at that place of his. You’d have been driven really crazy before long, and then your mind would have been closed to me, so that I wouldn’t have been able to get through to you, any more. What I did was the only thing I could do.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t hate you, Dearest,” he replied, mentally. “And I don’t blame you. It was a little disconcerting, though, to discover the extent of your capabilities.⁠ ⁠… How did you manage it?”</p>
			<p>“You remember how I made the Sergeant see an angel, the time you were down in the snow?” Colonel Hampton nodded. “Well, I made her see⁠ ⁠… things that weren’t angels,” Dearest continued. “After I’d driven her almost to distraction, I was able to get into her mind and take control of her.” Colonel Hampton felt a shudder inside of him. “That was horrible; that woman had a mind like a sewer; I still feel dirty from it! But I made her get the pistol⁠—I knew where you kept it⁠—and I knew how to use it, even if she didn’t. Remember when we were shooting muskrats, that time, along the river?”</p>
			<p>“Uhuh. I wondered how she knew enough to unlock the action and load the chamber.” He turned and faced the others.</p>
			<p>Doctor Vehrner was sitting on the floor, with his back to the chair Colonel Hampton had occupied, his injured leg stretched out in front of him. Albert was hovering over him with mother-hen solicitude. <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell was finishing his whiskey and recovering a fraction of his normal poise.</p>
			<p>“Well, I suppose you gentlemen see, now, who was really crazy around here?” Colonel Hampton addressed them bitingly. “That woman has been dangerously close to the borderline of sanity for as long as she’s been here. I think my precious nephew trumped up this ridiculous insanity complaint against me as much to discredit any testimony I might ever give about his wife’s mental condition as because he wanted to get control of my estate. I also suppose that the tension she was under here, this afternoon, was too much for her, and the scheme boomeranged on its originators. Curious case of poetic justice, but I’m sorry you had to be included in it, Doctor.”</p>
			<p>“Attaboy, Popsy!” Dearest enthused. “Now you have them on the run; don’t give them a chance to reform. You know what Patton always said⁠—Grab ’em by the nose and kick ’em in the pants.”</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton relighted his cigar. “Patton only said ‘pants’ when he was talking for publication,” he told her, sotto voce. Then he noticed the unsigned commitment paper lying on the desk. He picked it up, crumpled it, and threw it into the fire.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think you’ll be needing that,” he said. “You know, this isn’t the first time my loving nephew has expressed doubts as to my sanity.” He sat down in the chair at the desk, motioning to his servant to bring him a drink. “And see to the other gentlemen’s glasses, Sergeant,” he directed. “Back in 1929, Stephen thought I was crazy as a bedbug to sell all my securities and take a paper loss, around the first of September. After October 24th, I bought them back at about twenty percent of what I’d sold them for, after he’d lost his shirt.” That, he knew, would have an effect on <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell. “And in December, 1944, I was just plain nuts, selling all my munition shares and investing in a company that manufactured baby-food. Stephen thought that Rundstedt’s Ardennes counteroffensive would put off the end of the war for another year and a half!”</p>
			<p>“Baby-food, eh?” Doctor Vehrner chuckled.</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton sipped his whiskey slowly, then puffed on his cigar. “No, this pair were competent liars,” he replied. “A good workmanlike liar never makes up a story out of the whole cloth; he always takes a fabric of truth and embroiders it to suit the situation.” He smiled grimly; that was an accurate description of his own tactical procedure at the moment. “I hadn’t intended this to come out, Doctor, but it happens that I am a convinced believer in spiritualism. I suppose you’ll think that’s a delusional belief, too?”</p>
			<p>“Well.⁠ ⁠…” Doctor Vehrner pursed his lips. “I reject the idea of survival after death, myself, but I think that people who believe in such a theory are merely misevaluating evidence. It is definitely not, in itself, a symptom of a psychotic condition.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you, Doctor.” The Colonel gestured with his cigar. “Now, I’ll admit their statements about my appearing to be in conversation with some invisible or imaginary being. That’s all quite true. I’m convinced that I’m in direct-voice communication with the spirit of a young girl who was killed by Indians in this section about a hundred and seventy-five years ago. At first, she communicated by automatic writing; later we established direct-voice communication. Well, naturally, a man in my position would dislike the label of spirit-medium; there are too many invidious associations connected with the term. But there it is. I trust both of you gentlemen will remember the ethics of your respective professions and keep this confidential.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, brother!” Dearest was fairly hugging him with delight. “When bigger and better lies are told, we tell them, don’t we, Popsy?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, and try and prove otherwise,” Colonel Hampton replied, around his cigar. Then he blew a jet of smoke and spoke to the men in front of him.</p>
			<p>“I intend paying for my nephew’s hospitalization, and for his wife’s funeral,” he said. “And then, I’m going to pack up all his personal belongings, and all of hers; when he’s discharged from the hospital, I’ll ship them wherever he wants them. But he won’t be allowed to come back here. After this business, I’m through with him.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell nodded primly. “I don’t blame you, in the least, Colonel,” he said. “I think you have been abominably treated, and your attitude is most generous.” He was about to say something else, when the doorbell tinkled and Sergeant Williamson went out into the hall. “Oh, dear; I suppose that’s the police, now,” the lawyer said. He grimaced like a small boy in a dentist’s chair.</p>
			<p>Colonel Hampton felt Dearest leave him for a moment. Then she was back.</p>
			<p>“The ambulance.” Then he caught a sparkle of mischief in her mood. “Let’s have some fun, Popsy! The doctor is a young man, with brown hair and a mustache, horn-rimmed glasses, a blue tie and a tan-leather bag. One of the ambulance men has red hair, and the other has a mercurochrome-stain on his left sleeve. Tell them your spirit-guide told you.”</p>
			<p>The old soldier’s tobacco-yellowed mustache twitched with amusement.</p>
			<p>“No, gentlemen, it is the ambulance,” he corrected. “My spirit-control says.⁠ ⁠…” He relayed Dearest’s descriptions to them.</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell blinked. A speculative look came into the psychiatrist’s eyes; he was probably wishing the commitment paper hadn’t been destroyed.</p>
			<p>Then the doctor came bustling in, brown-mustached, blue-tied, spectacled, carrying a tan bag, and behind him followed the two ambulance men, one with a thatch of flaming red hair and the other with a stain of mercurochrome on his jacket-sleeve.</p>
			<p>For an instant, the lawyer and the psychiatrist gaped at them. Then <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">T.</abbr> Barnwell Powell put one hand to his mouth and made a small gibbering sound, and Doctor Vehrner gave a faint squawk, and then both men grabbed, simultaneously, for the whiskey bottle.</p>
			<p>The laughter of Dearest tinkled inaudibly through the rumbling mirth of Colonel Hampton.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">I</h3>
				<p>But yesterday, a whole planet had shouted: <em>Hail Hradzka! Hail the Leader!</em> Today, they were screaming: <em>Death to Hradzka! Kill the tyrant!</em></p>
				<p>The Palace, where Hradzka, surrounded by his sycophants and guards, had lorded it over a solar system, was now an inferno. Those who had been too closely identified with the dictator’s rule to hope for forgiveness were fighting to the last, seeking only a quick death in combat; one by one, their isolated points of resistance were being wiped out. The corridors and chambers of the huge palace were thronged with rebels, loud with their shouts, and with the rasping hiss of heat-beams and the crash of blasters, reeking with the stench of scorched plastic and burned flesh, of hot metal and charred fabric. The living quarters were overrun; the mob smashed down walls and tore up floors in search of secret hiding-places. They found strange things⁠—the spaceship that had been built under one of the domes, in readiness for flight to the still-loyal colonies on Mars or the Asteroid Belt, for instance⁠—but Hmradzka himself they could not find.</p>
				<p>At last, the search reached the New Tower which reared its head five thousand feet above the palace, the highest thing in the city. They blasted down the huge steel doors, cut the power from the energy-screens. They landed from antigrav-cars on the upper levels. But except for barriers of metal and concrete and energy, they met with no opposition. Finally, they came to the spiral stairway which led up to the great metal sphere which capped the whole structure.</p>
				<p>General Zarvas, the Army Commander who had placed himself at the head of the revolt, stood with his foot on the lowest step, his followers behind him. There was Prince Burvanny, the leader of the old nobility, and Ghorzesko Orhm, the merchant, and between them stood Tobbh, the chieftain of the mutinous slaves. There were clerks; laborers; poor but haughty nobles: and wealthy merchants who had long been forced to hide their riches from the dictator’s tax-gatherers, and soldiers, and spacemen.</p>
				<p>“You’d better let some of us go first sir,” General Zarvas’ orderly, a bloodstained bandage about his head, his uniform in rags, suggested. “You don’t know what might be up there.”</p>
				<p>The General shook his head. “I’ll go first.” Zarvas Pol was not the man to send subordinates into danger ahead of himself. “To tell the truth, I’m afraid we won’t find anything at all up there.”</p>
				<p>“You mean.⁠ ⁠… ?” Ghorzesko Orhm began.</p>
				<p>“The time machine,” Zarvas Pol replied. “If he’s managed to get it finished, the Great Mind only knows where he may be, now. Or when.”</p>
				<p>He loosened the blaster in his holster and started up the long spiral. His followers spread out, below; sharpshooters took position to cover his ascent. Prince Burvanny and Tobbh the Slave started to follow him. They hesitated as each motioned the other to precede him; then the nobleman followed the general, his blaster drawn, and the brawny slave behind him.</p>
				<p>The door at the top was open, and Zarvas Pol stepped through but there was nothing in the great spherical room except a raised dais some fifty feet in diameter, its polished metal top strangely clean and empty. And a crumpled heap of burned cloth and charred flesh that had, not long ago, been a man. An old man with a white beard, and the seven-pointed star of the Learned Brothers on his breast, advanced to meet the armed intruders.</p>
				<p>“So he is gone, Kradzy Zago?” Zarvas Pol said, holstering his weapon. “Gone in the time machine, to hide in yesterday or tomorrow. And you let him go?”</p>
				<p>The old one nodded. “He had a blaster, and I had none.” He indicated the body on the floor. “Zoldy Jarv had no blaster, either, but he tried to stop Hradzka. See, he squandered his life as a fool squanders his money, getting nothing for it. And a man’s life is not money, Zarvas Pol.”</p>
				<p>“I do not blame you, Kradzy Zago,” General Zarvas said. “But now you must get to work, and build us another time machine, so that we can hunt him down.”</p>
				<p>“Does revenge mean so much to you, then?”</p>
				<p>The soldier made an impatient gesture. “Revenge is for fools, like that pack of screaming beasts below. I do not kill for revenge; I kill because dead men do no harm.”</p>
				<p>“Hradzka will do us no more harm,” the old scientist replied. “He is a thing of yesterday; of a time long past and half-lost in the mists of legend.”</p>
				<p>“No matter. As long as he exists, at any point in space-time, Hradzka is still a threat. Revenge means much to Hradzka; he will return for it, when we least expect him.”</p>
				<p>The old man shook his head. “No, Zarvas Pol, Hradzka will not return.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Hradzka holstered his blaster, threw the switch that sealed the time machine, put on the antigrav-unit and started the time-shift unit. He reached out and set the destination-dial for the mid-Fifty-Second Century of the Atomic Era. That would land him in the Ninth Age of Chaos, following the Two-Century War and the collapse of the World Theocracy. A good time for his purpose: the world would be slipping back into barbarism, and yet possess the technologies of former civilizations. A hundred little national states would be trying to regain social stability, competing and warring with one another. Hradzka glanced back over his shoulder at the cases of books, record-spools, tri-dimensional pictures, and scale-models. These people of the past would welcome him and his science of the future, would make him their leader.</p>
				<p>He would start in a small way, by taking over the local feudal or tribal government, would arm his followers with weapons of the future. Then he would impose his rule upon neighboring tribes, or princedoms, or communes, or whatever, and build a strong sovereignty; from that he envisioned a world empire, a Solar System empire.</p>
				<p>Then, he would build time machines, many time machines. He would recruit an army such as the universe had never seen, a swarm of men from every age in the past. At that point, he would return to the Hundredth Century of the Atomic Era, to wreak vengeance upon those who had risen against him. A slow smile grew on Hradzka’s thin lips as he thought of the tortures with which he would put Zarvas Pol to death.</p>
				<p>He glanced up at the great disc of the indicator and frowned. Already he was back to the year 7500, <abbr epub:type="se:era">AE</abbr>, and the temporal-displacement had not begun to slow. The disc was turning even more rapidly⁠—7000, 6000, 5500; he gasped slightly. Then he had passed his destination; he was now in the Fortieth Century, but the indicator was slowing. The hairline crossed the Thirtieth Century, the Twentieth, the Fifteenth, the Tenth. He wondered what had gone wrong, but he had recovered from his fright by this time. When this insane machine stopped, as it must around the First Century of the Atomic Era, he would investigate, make repairs, then shift forward to his target-point. Hradzka was determined upon the Fifty-Second Century; he had made a special study of the history of that period, had learned the language spoken then, and he understood the methods necessary to gain power over the natives of that time.</p>
				<p>The indicator-disc came to a stop, in the First Century. He switched on the magnifier and leaned forward to look; he had emerged into normal time in the year 10 of the Atomic Era, a decade after the first uranium-pile had gone into operation, and seven years after the first atomic bombs had been exploded in warfare. The altimeter showed that he was hovering at eight thousand feet above ground-level.</p>
				<p>Slowly, he cut out the antigrav, letting the time machine down easily. He knew that there had been no danger of materializing inside anything; the New Tower had been built to put it above anything that had occupied that space-point at any moment within history, or legend, or even the geological knowledge of man. What lay below, however, was uncertain. It was night⁠—the visiscreen showed only a star-dusted, moonless-sky, and dark shadows below. He snapped another switch; for a few microseconds a beam of intense light was turned on, automatically photographing the landscape under him. A second later, the developed picture was projected upon another screen; it showed only wooded mountains and a barren, brush-grown valley.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The time machine came to rest with a soft jar and a crashing of broken bushes that was audible through the sound pickup. Hradzka pulled the main switch; there was a click as the shielding went out and the door opened. A breath of cool night air drew into the hollow sphere.</p>
				<p>Then there was a loud <i>bang</i> inside the mechanism, and a flash of blue-white light which turned to pinkish flame with a nasty crackling. Curls of smoke began to rise from the square black box that housed the “time-shift” mechanism, and from behind the instrument-board. In a moment, everything was glowing-hot: driblets of aluminum and silver were running down from the instruments. Then the whole interior of the time machine was afire; there was barely time for Hradzka to leap through the open door.</p>
				<p>The brush outside impeded him, and he used his blaster to clear a path for himself away from the big sphere, which was now glowing faintly on the outside. The heat grew in intensity, and the brush outside was taking fire. It was not until he had gotten two hundred yards from the machine that he stopped, realizing what had happened.</p>
				<p>The machine, of course, had been sabotaged. That would have been young Zoldy, whom he had killed, or that old billy-goat, Kradzy Zago; the latter, most likely. He cursed both of them for having marooned him in this savage age, at the very beginning of atomic civilization, with all his printed and recorded knowledge destroyed. Oh, he could still gain mastery over these barbarians; he knew enough to fashion a crude blaster, or a heat-beam gun, or an atomic-electric conversion unit. But without his books and records, he could never build an antigrav unit, and the secret of the “temporal shift” was lost.</p>
				<p>For “Time” is not an object, or a medium which can be travelled along. The “Time-Machine” was not a vehicle; it was a mechanical process of displacement within the space-time continuum, and those who constructed it knew that it could not be used with the sort of accuracy that the dials indicated. Hradzka had ordered his scientists to produce a “Time Machine,” and they had combined the possible⁠—displacement within the space-time continuum⁠—with the sort of fiction the dictator demanded, for their own well-being. Even had there been no sabotage, his return to his own “time” was nearly of zero probability.</p>
				<p>The fire, spreading from the time machine, was blowing toward him; he observed the wind-direction and hurried around out of the path of the flames. The light enabled him to pick his way through the brush, and, after crossing a small stream, he found a rutted road and followed it up the mountainside until he came to a place where he could rest concealed until morning.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="flight-from-tomorrow-2" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">II</h3>
				<p>It was broad daylight when he woke, and there was a strange throbbing sound; Hradzka lay motionless under the brush where he had slept, his blaster ready. In a few minutes, a vehicle came into sight, following the road down the mountainside.</p>
				<p>It was a large thing, four-wheeled, with a projection in front which probably housed the engine and a cab for the operator. The body of the vehicle was simply an open rectangular box. There were two men in the cab, and about twenty or thirty more crowded into the box body. These were dressed in faded and nondescript garments of blue and gray and brown; all were armed with crude weapons⁠—axes, billhooks, long-handled instruments with serrated edges, and what looked like broad-bladed spears. The vehicle itself, which seemed to be propelled by some sort of chemical-explosion engine, was dingy and mud-splattered; the men in it were ragged and unshaven. Hradzka snorted in contempt; they were probably warriors of the local tribe, going to the fire in the belief that it had been started by raiding enemies. When they found the wreckage of the time machine, they would no doubt believe that it was the chariot of some god and drag it home to be venerated.</p>
				<p>A plan of action was taking shape in his mind. First, he must get clothing of the sort worn by these people, and find a safe hiding-place for his own things. Then, pretending to be a deaf-mute, he would go among them to learn something of their customs and pick up the language. When he had done that, he would move on to another tribe or village, able to tell a credible story for himself. For a while, it would be necessary for him to do menial work, but in the end, he would establish himself among these people. Then he could gather around him a faction of those who were dissatisfied with whatever conditions existed, organize a conspiracy, make arms for his followers, and start his program of power-seizure.</p>
				<p>The matter of clothing was attended to shortly after he had crossed the mountain and descended into the valley on the other side. Hearing a clinking sound some distance from the road, as of metal striking stone, Hradzka stole cautiously through the woods until he came within sight of a man who was digging with a mattock, uprooting small bushes of a particular sort, with rough gray bark and three-pointed leaves. When he had dug one up, he would cut off the roots and then slice away the root-bark with a knife, putting it into a sack. Hradzka’s lip curled contemptuously; the fellow was gathering the stuff for medicinal use. He had heard of the use of roots and herbs for such purposes by the ancient savages.</p>
				<p>The blaster would be no use here; it was too powerful, and would destroy the clothing that the man was wearing. He unfastened a strap from his belt and attached it to a stone to form a hand-loop, then, inched forward behind the lone herb-gatherer. When he was close enough, he straightened and rushed forward, swinging his improvised weapon. The man heard him and turned, too late.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>After undressing his victim, Hradzka used the mattock to finish him, and then to dig a grave. The fugitive buried his own clothes with the murdered man, and donned the faded blue shirt, rough shoes, worn trousers and jacket. The blaster he concealed under the jacket, and he kept a few other Hundredth Century gadgets; these he would hide somewhere closer to his center of operations.</p>
				<p>He had kept, among other things, a small box of food-concentrate capsules, and in one pocket of the newly acquired jacket he found a package containing food. It was rough and unappetizing fare⁠—slices of cold cooked meat between slices of some cereal substance. He ate these before filling in the grave, and put the paper wrappings in with the dead man. Then, his work finished, he threw the mattock into the brush and set out again, grimacing disgustedly and scratching himself. The clothing he had appropriated was verminous.</p>
				<p>Crossing another mountain, he descended into a second valley, and, for a time, lost his way among a tangle of narrow ravines. It was dark by the time he mounted a hill and found himself looking down another valley, in which a few scattered lights gave evidence of human habitations. Not wishing to arouse suspicion by approaching these in the nighttime, he found a place among some young evergreens where he could sleep.</p>
				<p>The next morning, having breakfasted on a concentrate capsule, he found a hiding-place for his blaster in a hollow tree. It was in a sufficiently prominent position so that he could easily find it again, and at the same time unlikely to be discovered by some native. Then he went down into the inhabited valley.</p>
				<p>He was surprised at the ease with which he established contact with the natives. The first dwelling which he approached, a cluster of farm-buildings at the upper end of the valley, gave him shelter. There was a man, clad in the same sort of rough garments Hradzka had taken from the body of the herb-gatherer, and a woman in a faded and shapeless dress. The man was thin and work-bent; the woman short and heavy. Both were past middle age.</p>
				<p>He made inarticulate sounds to attract their attention, then gestured to his mouth and ears to indicate his assumed affliction. He rubbed his stomach to portray hunger. Looking about, he saw an ax sticking in a chopping-block, and a pile of wood near it, probably the fuel used by these people. He took the ax, split up some of the wood, then repeated the hunger-signs. The man and the woman both nodded, laughing; he was shown a pile of tree-limbs, and the man picked up a short billet of wood and used it like a measuring-rule, to indicate that all the wood was to be cut to that length.</p>
				<p>Hradzka fell to work, and by midmorning, he had all the wood cut. He had seen a circular stone, mounted on a trestle with a metal axle through it, and judged it to be some sort of a grinding-wheel, since it was fitted with a foot-pedal and a rusty metal can was set above it to spill water onto the grinding-edge. After chopping the wood, he carefully sharpened the ax, handing it to the man for inspection. This seemed to please the man; he clapped Hradzka on the shoulder, making commendatory sounds.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>It required considerable time and ingenuity to make himself a more or less permanent member of the household. Hradzka had made a survey of the farmyard, noting the sorts of work that would normally be performed on the farm, and he pantomimed this work in its simpler operations. He pointed to the east, where the sun would rise, and to the zenith, and to the west. He made signs indicative of eating, and of sleeping, and of rising, and of working. At length, he succeeded in conveying his meaning.</p>
				<p>There was considerable argument between the man and the woman, but his proposal was accepted, as he expected that it would. It was easy to see that the work of the farm was hard for this aging couple; now, for a place to sleep and a little food, they were able to acquire a strong and intelligent slave.</p>
				<p>In the days that followed, he made himself useful to the farm people; he fed the chickens and the livestock, milked the cow, worked in the fields. He slept in a small room at the top of the house, under the eaves, and ate with the man and woman in the farmhouse kitchen.</p>
				<p>It was not long before he picked up a few words which he had heard his employers using, and related them to the things or acts spoken of. And he began to notice that these people, in spite of the crudities of their own life, enjoyed some of the advantages of a fairly complex civilization. Their implements were not handcraft products, but showed machine workmanship. There were two objects hanging on hooks on the kitchen wall which he was sure were weapons. Both had wooden shoulder-stocks, and wooden fore-pieces; they had long tubes extending to the front, and triggers like blasters. One had double tubes mounted side-by-side, and double triggers; the other had an octagonal tube mounted over a round tube, and a loop extension on the trigger-guard. Then, there was a box on the kitchen wall, with a mouthpiece and a cylindrical tube on a cord. Sometimes a bell would ring out of the box, and the woman would go to this instrument, take down the tube and hold it to her ear, and talk into the mouthpiece. There was another box from which voices would issue, of people conversing, or of orators, or of singing, and sometimes instrumental music. None of these were objects made by savages; these people probably traded with some fairly high civilization. They were not illiterate; he found printed matter, indicating the use of some phonetic alphabet, and paper pamphlets containing printed reproductions of photographs as well as verbal text.</p>
				<p>There was also a vehicle on the farm, powered, like the one he had seen on the road, by an engine in which a hydrocarbon liquid-fuel was exploded. He made it his business to examine this minutely, and to study its construction and operation until he was thoroughly familiar with it.</p>
				<p>It was not until the third day after his arrival that the chickens began to die. In the morning, Hradzka found three of them dead when he went to feed them, the rest drooping unhealthily; he summoned the man and showed him what he had found. The next morning, they were all dead, and the cow was sick. She gave bloody milk, that evening, and the next morning she lay in her stall and would not get up.</p>
				<p>The man and the woman were also beginning to sicken, though both of them tried to continue their work. It was the woman who first noticed that the plants around the farmhouse were withering and turning yellow.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The farmer went to the stable with Hradzka and looked at the cow. Shaking his head, he limped back to the house, and returned carrying one of the weapons from the kitchen⁠—the one with the single trigger and the octagonal tube. As he entered the stable, he jerked down and up on the loop extension of the trigger-guard, then put the weapon to his shoulder and pointed it at the cow. It made a flash, and roared louder even than a hand-blaster, and the cow jerked convulsively and was dead. The man then indicated by signs that Hradzka was to drag the dead cow out of the stable, dig a hole, and bury it. This Hradzka did, carefully examining the wound in the cow’s head⁠—the weapon, he decided, was not an energy-weapon, but a simple solid-missile projector.</p>
				<p>By evening, neither the man nor the woman were able to eat, and both seemed to be suffering intensely. The man used the communicating-instrument on the wall, probably calling on his friends for help. Hradzka did what he could to make them comfortable, cooked his own meal, washed the dishes as he had seen the woman doing, and tidied up the kitchen.</p>
				<p>It was not long before people, men and women whom he had seen on the road or who had stopped at the farmhouse while he had been there, began arriving, some carrying baskets of food; and shortly after Hradzka had eaten, a vehicle like the farmer’s, but in better condition and of better quality, arrived and a young man got out of it and entered the house, carrying a leather bag. He was apparently some sort of a scientist; he examined the man and his wife, asked many questions, and administered drugs. He also took samples for blood-tests and urinalysis. This, Hradzka considered, was another of the many contradictions he had encountered among these people⁠—this man behaved like an educated scientist, and seemingly had nothing in common with the peasant herb-gatherer on the mountainside.</p>
				<p>The fact was that Hradzka was worried. The strange death of the animals, the blight which had smitten the trees and vegetables around the farm, and the sickness of the farmer and his woman, all mystified him. He did not know of any disease which would affect plants and animals and humans; he wondered if some poisonous gas might not be escaping from the earth near the farmhouse. However, he had not, himself, been affected. He also disliked the way in which the doctor and the neighbors seemed to be talking about him. While he had come to a considerable revision of his original opinion about the culture-level of these people, it was not impossible that they might suspect him of having caused the whole thing by witchcraft; at any moment, they might fall upon him and put him to death. In any case, there was no longer any use in his staying here, and it might be wise if he left at once.</p>
				<p>Accordingly, he filled his pockets with food from the pantry and slipped out of the farmhouse; before his absence was discovered he was well on his way down the road.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="flight-from-tomorrow-3" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">III</h3>
				<p>That night, Hradzka slept under a bridge across a fairly wide stream; the next morning, he followed the road until he came to a town. It was not a large place; there were perhaps four or five hundred houses and other buildings in it. Most of these were dwellings like the farmhouse where he had been staying, but some were much larger, and seemed to be places of business. One of these latter was a concrete structure with wide doors at the front; inside, he could see men working on the internal-combustion vehicles which seemed to be in almost universal use. Hradzka decided to obtain employment here.</p>
				<p>It would be best, he decided, to continue his pretense of being a deaf-mute. He did not know whether a world-language were in use at this time or not, and even if not, the pretense of being a foreigner unable to speak the local dialect might be dangerous. So he entered the vehicle-repair shop and accosted a man in a clean shirt who seemed to be issuing instructions to the workers, going into his pantomime of the homeless mute seeking employment.</p>
				<p>The master of the repair-shop merely laughed at him, however. Hradzka became more insistent in his manner, making signs to indicate his hunger and willingness to work. The other men in the shop left their tasks and gathered around; there was much laughter and unmistakably ribald and derogatory remarks. Hradzka was beginning to give up hope of getting employment here when one of the workmen approached the master and whispered something to him.</p>
				<p>The two of them walked away, conversing in low voices. Hradzka thought he understood the situation; no doubt the workman, thinking to lighten his own labor, was urging that the vagrant be employed, for no other pay than food and lodging. At length, the master assented to his employee’s urgings; he returned, showed Hradzka a hose and a bucket and sponges and cloths, and set him to work cleaning the mud from one of the vehicles. Then, after seeing that the work was being done properly, he went away, entering a room at one side of the shop.</p>
				<p>About twenty minutes later, another man entered the shop. He was not dressed like any of the other people whom Hradzka had seen; he wore a gray tunic and breeches, polished black boots, and a cap with a visor and a metal insignia on it; on a belt, he carried a holstered weapon like a blaster.</p>
				<p>After speaking to one of the workers, who pointed Hradzka out to him, he approached the fugitive and said something. Hradzka made gestures at his mouth and ears and made gargling sounds; the newcomer shrugged and motioned him to come with him, at the same time producing a pair of handcuffs from his belt and jingling them suggestively.</p>
				<p>In a few seconds, Hradzka tried to analyze the situation and estimate its possibilities. The newcomer was a soldier, or, more likely, a policeman, since manacles were a part of his equipment. Evidently, since the evening before, a warning had been made public by means of communicating devices such as he had seen at the farm, advising people that a man of his description, pretending to be a deaf-mute, should be detained and the police notified; it had been for that reason that the workman had persuaded his master to employ Hradzka. No doubt he would be accused of causing the conditions at the farm by sorcery.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Hradzka shrugged and nodded, then went to the water-tap to turn off the hose he had been using. He disconnected it, coiled it and hung it up, and then picked up the water-bucket. Then, without warning, he hurled the water into the policeman’s face, sprang forward, swinging the bucket by the bale, and hit the man on the head. Releasing his grip on the bucket, he tore the blaster or whatever it was from the holster.</p>
				<p>One of the workers swung a hammer, as though to throw it. Hradzka aimed the weapon at him and pulled the trigger; the thing belched fire and kicked back painfully in his hand, and the man fell. He used it again to drop the policeman, then thrust it into the waistband of his trousers and ran outside. The thing was not a blaster at all, he realized⁠—only a missile-projector like the big weapons at the farm, utilizing the force of some chemical explosive.</p>
				<p>The policeman’s vehicle was standing outside. It was a small, single-seat, two wheeled affair. Having become familiar with the principles of these hydrocarbon engines from examination of the vehicle of the farm, and accustomed as he was to far more complex mechanisms than this crude affair, Hradzka could see at a glance how to operate it. Springing onto the saddle, he kicked away the folding support and started the engine. Just as he did, the master of the repair-shop ran outside, one of the small hand-weapons in his hand, and fired several shots. They all missed, but Hradzka heard the whining sound of the missiles passing uncomfortably close to him.</p>
				<p>It was imperative that he recover the blaster he had hidden in the hollow tree at the head of the valley. By this time, there would be a concerted search under way for him, and he needed a better weapon than the solid-missile projector he had taken from the policeman. He did not know how many shots the thing contained, but if it propelled solid missiles by chemical explosion, there could not have been more than five or six such charges in the cylindrical part of the weapon which he had assumed to be the charge-holder. On the other hand, his blaster, a weapon of much greater power, contained enough energy for five hundred blasts, and with it were eight extra energy-capsules, giving him a total of four thousand five hundred blasts.</p>
				<p>Handling the two-wheeled vehicle was no particular problem; although he had never ridden on anything of the sort before, it was child’s play compared to controlling a Hundredth Century strato-rocket, and Hradzka was a skilled rocket-pilot.</p>
				<p>Several times he passed vehicles on the road⁠—the passenger vehicles with enclosed cabins, and cargo-vehicles piled high with farm produce. Once he encountered a large number of children, gathered in front of a big red building with a flagstaff in front, from which a queer flag, with horizontal red and white stripes and a white-spotted blue device in the corner, flew. They scattered off the road in terror at his approach; fortunately, he hit none of them, for at the speed at which he was traveling, such a collision would have wrecked his light vehicle.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>As he approached the farm where he had spent the past few days, he saw two passenger-vehicles standing by the road. One was a black one, similar to the one in which the physician had come to the farm, and the other was white with black trimmings and bore the same device he had seen on the cap of the policeman. A policeman was sitting in the driver’s seat of this vehicle, and another policeman was standing beside it, breathing smoke with one of the white paper cylinders these people used. In the farmyard, two men were going about with a square black box; to this box, a tube was connected by a wire, and they were passing the tube about over the ground.</p>
				<p>The policeman who was standing beside the vehicle saw him approach, and blew his whistle, then drew the weapon from his belt. Hradzka, who had been expecting some attempt to halt him, had let go the right-hand steering handle and drawn his own weapon; as the policeman drew, he fired at him. Without observing the effect of the shot, he sped on; before he had rounded the bend above the farm, several shots were fired after him.</p>
				<p>A mile beyond, he came to the place where he had hidden the blaster. He stopped the vehicle and jumped off, plunging into the brush and racing toward the hollow tree. Just as he reached it, he heard a vehicle approach and stop, and the door of the police vehicle slam. Hradzka’s fingers found the belt of his blaster; he dragged it out and buckled it on, tossing away the missile weapon he had been carrying.</p>
				<p>Then, crouching behind the tree, he waited. A few moments later, he caught a movement in the brush toward the road. He brought up the blaster, aimed and squeezed the trigger. There was a faint bluish glow at the muzzle, and a blast of energy tore through the brush, smashing the molecular structure of everything that stood in the way. There was an involuntary shout of alarm from the direction of the road; at least one of the policemen had escaped the blast. Hradzka holstered his weapon and crept away for some distance, keeping under cover, then turned and waited for some sign of the presence of his enemies. For some time nothing happened; he decided to turn hunter against the men who were hunting him. He started back in the direction of the road, making a wide circle, flitting silently from rock to bush and from bush to tree, stopping often to look and listen.</p>
				<p>This finally brought him upon one of the policemen, and almost terminated his flight at the same time. He must have grown overconfident and careless; suddenly a weapon roared, and a missile smashed through the brush inches from his face. The shot had come from his left and a little to the rear. Whirling, he blasted four times, in rapid succession, then turned and fled for a few yards, dropping and crawling behind a rock. When he looked back, he could see wisps of smoke rising from the shattered trees and bushes which had absorbed the energy-output of his weapon, and he caught a faint odor of burned flesh. One of his pursuers, at least, would pursue him no longer.</p>
				<p>He slipped away, down into the tangle of ravines and hollows in which he had wandered the day before his arrival at the farm. For the time being, he felt safe, and finally confident that he was not being pursued, he stopped to rest. The place where he stopped seemed familiar, and he looked about. In a moment, he recognized the little stream, the pool where he had bathed his feet, the clump of seedling pines under which he had slept. He even found the silver-foil wrapping from the food concentrate capsule.</p>
				<p>But there had been a change, since the night when he had slept here. Then the young pines had been green and alive; now they were blighted, and their needles had turned brown. Hradzka stood for a long time, looking at them. It was the same blight that had touched the plants around the farmhouse. And here, among the pine needles on the ground, lay a dead bird.</p>
				<p>It took some time for him to admit, to himself, the implications of vegetation, the chickens, the cow, the farmer and his wife, had all sickened and died. He had been in this place, and now, when he had returned, he found that death had followed him here, too.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>During the early centuries of the Atomic Era, he knew, there had been great wars, the stories of which had survived even to the Hundredth Century. Among the weapons that had been used, there had been artificial plagues and epidemics, caused by new types of bacteria developed in laboratories, against which the victims had possessed no protection. Those germs and viruses had persisted for centuries, and gradually had lost their power to harm mankind. Suppose, now, that he had brought some of them back with him, to a century before they had been developed. Suppose, that was, that he were a human plague-carrier. He thought of the vermin that had infested the clothing he had taken from the man he had killed on the other side of the mountain; they had not troubled him after the first day.</p>
				<p>There was a throbbing mechanical sound somewhere in the air; he looked about, and finally identified its source. A small aircraft had come over the valley from the other side of the mountain and was circling lazily overhead. He froze, shrinking back under a pine-tree; as long as he remained motionless, he would not be seen, and soon the thing would go away. He was beginning to understand why the search for him was being pressed so relentlessly; as long as he remained alive, he was a menace to everybody in this First Century world.</p>
				<p>He got out his supply of food concentrates, saw that he had only three capsules left, and put them away again. For a long time, he sat under the dying tree, chewing on a twig and thinking. There must be some way in which he could overcome, or even utilize, his inherent deadliness to these people. He might find some isolated community, conceal himself near it, invade it at night and infect it, and then, when everybody was dead, move in and take it for himself. But was there any such isolated community? The farmhouse where he had worked had been fairly remote, yet its inhabitants had been in communication with the outside world, and the physician had come immediately in response to their call for help.</p>
				<p>The little aircraft had been circling overhead, directly above the place where he lay hidden. For a while, Hradzka was afraid it had spotted him, and was debating the advisability of using his blaster on it. Then it banked, turned and went away. He watched it circle over the valley on the other side of the mountain, and got to his feet.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">IV</h3>
				<p>Almost at once, there was a new sound⁠—a multiple throbbing, at a quick, snarling tempo that hinted at enormous power, growing louder each second. Hradzka stiffened and drew his blaster; as he did, five more aircraft swooped over the crest of the mountain and came rushing down toward him; not aimlessly, but as though they knew exactly where he was. As they approached, the leading edges of their wings sparkled with light, branches began flying from the trees about him, and there was a loud hammering noise.</p>
				<p>He aimed a little in front of them and began blasting. A wing flew from one of the aircraft, and it plunged downward. Another came apart in the air; a third burst into flames. The other two zoomed upward quickly. Hradzka swung his blaster after them, blasting again and again. He hit a fourth with a blast of energy, knocking it to pieces, and then the fifth was out of range. He blasted at it twice, but without effect; a hand-blaster was only good for a thousand yards at the most.</p>
				<p>Holstering his weapon, he hurried away, following the stream and keeping under cover of trees. The last of the attacking aircraft had gone away, but the little scout-plane was still circling about, well out of blaster-range.</p>
				<p>Once or twice, Hradzka was compelled to stay hidden for some time, not knowing the nature of the pilot’s ability to detect him. It was during one of these waits that the next phase of the attack developed.</p>
				<p>It began, like the last one, with a distant roar that swelled in volume until it seemed to fill the whole world. Then, fifteen or twenty thousand feet out of blaster-range, the new attackers swept into sight.</p>
				<p>There must have been fifty of them, huge tapering things with widespread wings, flying in close formation, wave after V-shaped wave. He stood and stared at them, amazed; he had never imagined that such aircraft existed in the First Century. Then a high-pitched screaming sound cut through the roar of the propellers, and for an instant he saw countless small specks in the sky, falling downward.</p>
				<p>The first bomb-salvo landed in the young pines, where he had fought against the first air attack. Great gouts of flame shot upward, and smoke, and flying earth and debris. Hradzka turned and started to run. Another salvo fell in front of him; he veered to the left and plunged on through the undergrowth. Now the bombs were falling all about him, deafening him with their thunder, shaking him with concussion. He dodged, frightened, as the trunk of a tree came crashing down beside him. Then something hit him across the back, knocking him flat. For a moment, he lay stunned, then tried to rise. As he did, a searing light filled his eyes and a wave of intolerable heat swept over him. Then darkness.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“No, Zarvas Pol,” Kradzy Zago repeated. “Hradzka will not return; the time machine was sabotaged.”</p>
				<p>“So? By you?” the soldier asked.</p>
				<p>The scientist nodded. “I knew the purpose for which he intended it. Hradzka was not content with having enslaved a whole Solar System: he hungered to bring tyranny and serfdom to all the past and all the future as well; he wanted to be master not only of the present but of the centuries that were and were to be, as well. I never took part in politics, Zarvas Pol; I had no hand in this revolt. But I could not be party to such a crime as Hradzka contemplated when it lay within my power to prevent it.”</p>
				<p>“The machine will take him out of our space-time continuum, or back to a time when this planet was a swirling cloud of flaming gas?” Zarvas Pol asked.</p>
				<p>Kradzy Zago shook his head. “No, the unit is not powerful enough for that. It will only take him about ten thousand years into the past. But then, when it stops, the machine will destroy itself. It may destroy Hradzka with it or he may escape. But if he does, he will be left stranded ten thousand years ago, when he can do us no harm.</p>
				<p>“Actually, it did not operate as he imagined and there is an infinitely small chance that he could have returned to our ‘time,’ in any event. But I wanted to insure against even so small a chance.”</p>
				<p>“We can’t be sure of that,” Zarvas Pol objected. “He may know more about the machine than you think; enough more to build another like it. So you must build me a machine and I’ll take back a party of volunteers and hunt him down.”</p>
				<p>“That would not be necessary, and you would only share his fate.” Then, apparently changing the subject, Kradzy Zago asked: “Tell me, Zarvas Pol; have you never heard the legends of the Deadly Radiations?”</p>
				<p>General Zarvas smiled. “Who has not? Every cadet at the Officers’ College dreams of rediscovering them, to use as a weapon, but nobody ever has. We hear these tales of how, in the early days, atomic engines and piles and fission-bombs emitted particles which were utterly deadly, which would make anything with which they came in contact deadly, which would bring a horrible death to any human being. But these are only myths. All the ancient experiments have been duplicated time and again, and the deadly radiation effect has never been observed. Some say that it is a mere old wives’ terror tale; some say that the deaths were caused by fear of atomic energy, when it was still unfamiliar; others contend that the fundamental nature of atomic energy has altered by the degeneration of the fissionable matter. For my own part, I’m not enough of a scientist to have an opinion.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The old one smiled wanly. “None of these theories are correct. In the beginning of the Atomic Era, the Deadly Radiations existed. They still exist, but they are no longer deadly, because all life on this planet has adapted itself to such radiations, and all living things are now immune to them.”</p>
				<p>“And Hradzka has returned to a time when such immunity did not exist? But would that not be to his advantage?”</p>
				<p>“Remember, General, that man has been using atomic energy for ten thousand years. Our whole world has become drenched with radioactivity. The planet, the seas, the atmosphere, and every living thing, are all radioactive, now. Radioactivity is as natural to us as the air we breathe. Now, you remember hearing of the great wars of the first centuries of the Atomic Era, in which whole nations were wiped out, leaving only hundreds of survivors out of millions. You, no doubt, think that such tales are products of ignorant and barbaric imagination, but I assure you, they are literally true. It was not the blast-effect of a few bombs which created such holocausts, but the radiations released by the bombs. And those who survived to carry on the race were men and women whose systems resisted the radiations, and they transmitted to their progeny that power of resistance. In many cases, their children were mutants⁠—not monsters, although there were many of them, too, which did not survive⁠—but humans who were immune to radioactivity.”</p>
				<p>“An interesting theory, Kradzy Zago,” the soldier commented. “And one which conforms both to what we know of atomic energy and to the ancient legends. Then you would say that those radiations are still deadly⁠—to the non-immune?”</p>
				<p>“Exactly. And Hradzka, his body emitting those radiations, has returned to the First Century of the Atomic Era⁠—to a world without immunity.”</p>
				<p>General Zarvas’ smile vanished. “Man!” he cried in horror. “You have loosed a carrier of death among those innocent people of the past!”</p>
				<p>Kradzy Zago nodded. “That is true. I estimate that Hradzka will probably cause the death of a hundred or so people, before he is dealt with. But dealt with he will be. Tell me, General; if a man should appear now, out of nowhere, spreading a strange and horrible plague wherever he went, what would you do?”</p>
				<p>“Why, I’d hunt him down and kill him,” General Zarvas replied. “Not for anything he did, but for the menace he was. And then, I’d cover his body with a mass of concrete bigger than this palace.”</p>
				<p>“Precisely.” Kradzy Zago smiled. “And the military commanders and political leaders of the First Century were no less ruthless or efficient than you. You know how atomic energy was first used? There was an ancient nation, upon the ruins of whose cities we have built our own, which was famed for its idealistic humanitarianism. Yet that nation, treacherously attacked, created the first atomic bombs in self defense, and used them. It is among the people of that nation that Hradzka has emerged.”</p>
				<p>“But would they recognize him as the cause of the calamity he brings among them?”</p>
				<p>“Of course. He will emerge at the time when atomic energy is first being used. They will have detectors for the Deadly Radiations⁠—detectors we know nothing of, today, for a detection instrument must be free from the thing it is intended to detect, and today everything is radioactive. It will be a day or so before they discover what is happening to them, and not a few will die in that time, I fear; but once they have found out what is killing their people, Hradzka’s days⁠—no, his hours⁠—will be numbered.”</p>
				<p>“A mass of concrete bigger than this place,” Tobbh the Slave repeated General Zarvas’ words. “<em>The Ancient Spaceport!</em>”</p>
				<p>Prince Burvanny clapped him on the shoulder. “Tobbh, man! You’ve hit it!”</p>
				<p>“You mean.⁠ ⁠… ?” Kradzy Zago began.</p>
				<p>“Yes. You all know of it. It’s stood for nobody knows how many millennia, and nobody’s ever decided what it was, to begin with, except that somebody, once, filled a valley with concrete, level from mountain-top to mountain-top. The accepted theory is that it was done for a firing-stand for the first Moon-rocket. But gentlemen, our friend Tobbh’s explained it. It is the tomb of Hradzka, and it has been the tomb of Hradzka for ten thousand years before Hradzka was born!”</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">I</h3>
				<p>Aboard the ship, there was neither day nor night; the hours slipped gently by, as vistas of star-gemmed blackness slid across the visiscreens. For the crew, time had some meaning⁠—one watch on duty and two off. But for the thousand-odd colonists, the men and women who were to be the spearhead of migration to a new and friendlier planet, it had none. They slept, and played, worked at such tasks as they could invent, and slept again, while the huge ship followed her plotted trajectory.</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard, the army officer who would lead them in their new home, had as little to do as any of his followers. The ship’s officers had all the responsibility for the voyage, and, for the first time in over five years, he had none at all. He was finding the unaccustomed idleness more wearying than the hectic work of loading the ship before the blastoff from Doorsha. He went over his landing and security plans again, and found no probable emergency unprepared for. Dard wandered about the ship, talking to groups of his colonists, and found morale even better than he had hoped. He spent hours staring into the forward visiscreens, watching the disc of Tareesh, the planet of his destination, grow larger and plainer ahead.</p>
				<p>Now, with the voyage almost over, he was in the cargo-hold just aft of the Number Seven bulkhead, with six girls to help him, checking construction material which would be needed immediately after landing. The stuff had all been checked two or three times before, but there was no harm in going over it again. It furnished an occupation to fill in the time; it gave Kalvar Dard an excuse for surrounding himself with half a dozen charming girls, and the girls seemed to enjoy being with him. There was tall blonde Olva, the electromagnetician; pert little Varnis, the machinist’s helper; Kyna, the surgeon’s-aide; dark-haired Analea; Dorita, the accountant; plump little Eldra, the armament technician. At the moment, they were all sitting on or around the desk in the corner of the storeroom, going over the inventory when they were not just gabbling.</p>
				<p>“Well, how about the rock-drill bitts?” Dorita was asking earnestly, trying to stick to business. “Won’t we need them almost as soon as we’re off?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, we’ll have to dig temporary magazines for our explosives, small-arms and artillery ammunition, and storage-pits for our fissionables and radioactives,” Kalvar Dard replied. “We’ll have to have safe places for that stuff ready before it can be unloaded; and if we run into hard rock near the surface, we’ll have to drill holes for blasting-shots.”</p>
				<p>“The drilling machinery goes into one of those prefabricated sheds,” Eldra considered. “Will there be room in it for all the bitts, too?”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard shrugged. “Maybe. If not, we’ll cut poles and build racks for them outside. The bitts are nono-steel; they can be stored in the open.”</p>
				<p>“If there are poles to cut,” Olva added.</p>
				<p>“I’m not worrying about that,” Kalvar Dard replied. “We have a pretty fair idea of conditions on Tareesh; our astronomers have been making telescopic observations for the past fifteen centuries. There’s a pretty big Arctic icecap, but it’s been receding slowly, with a wide belt of what’s believed to be open grassland to the south of it, and a belt of what’s assumed to be evergreen forest south of that. We plan to land somewhere in the northern hemisphere, about the grassland-forest line. And since Tareesh is richer in water that Doorsha, you mustn’t think of grassland in terms of our wire-grass plains, or forests in terms of our brush thickets. The vegetation should be much more luxuriant.”</p>
				<p>“If there’s such a large polar icecap, the summers ought to be fairly cool, and the winters cold,” Varnis reasoned. “I’d think that would mean fur-bearing animals. Colonel, you’ll have to shoot me something with a nice soft fur; I like furs.”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard chuckled. “Shoot you nothing, you can shoot your own furs. I’ve seen your carbine and pistol scores,” he began.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>There was a sudden suck of air, disturbing the papers on the desk. They all turned to see one of the ship’s rocket-boat bays open; a young Air Force lieutenant named Seldar Glav, who would be staying on Tareesh with them to pilot their aircraft, emerged from an open airlock.</p>
				<p>“Don’t tell me you’ve been to Tareesh and back in that thing,” Olva greeted him.</p>
				<p>Seldar Glav grinned at her. “I could have been, at that; we’re only twenty or thirty planetary calibers away, now. We ought to be entering Tareeshan atmosphere by the middle of the next watch. I was only checking the boats, to make sure they’ll be ready to launch.⁠ ⁠… Colonel Kalvar, would you mind stepping over here? There’s something I think you should look at, sir.”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard took one arm from around Analea’s waist and lifted the other from Varnis’ shoulder, sliding off the desk. He followed Glav into the boat-bay; as they went through the airlock, the cheerfulness left the young lieutenant’s face.</p>
				<p>“I didn’t want to say anything in front of the girls, sir,” he began, “but I’ve been checking boats to make sure we can make a quick getaway. Our meteor-security’s gone out. The detectors are deader then the Fourth Dynasty, and the blasters won’t synchronize.⁠ ⁠… Did you hear a big thump, about a half an hour ago, Colonel?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, I thought the ship’s labor-crew was shifting heavy equipment in the hold aft of us. What was it, a meteor-hit?”</p>
				<p>“It was. Just aft of Number Ten bulkhead. A meteor about the size of the nose of that rocket-boat.”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard whistled softly. “Great Gods of Power! The detectors must be dead, to pass up anything like that.⁠ ⁠… Why wasn’t a boat-stations call sent out?”</p>
				<p>“Captain Vlazil was unwilling to risk starting a panic, sir,” the Air Force officer replied. “Really, I’m exceeding my orders in mentioning it to you, but I thought you should know.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard swore. “It’s a blasted pity Captain Vlazil didn’t try thinking! Gold-braided quarter-wit! Maybe his crew might panic, but my people wouldn’t.⁠ ⁠… I’m going to call the control-room and have it out with him. By the Ten Gods.⁠ ⁠… !”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>He ran through the airlock and back into the hold, starting toward the intercom-phone beside the desk. Before he could reach it, there was another heavy jar, rocking the entire ship. He, and Seldar Glav, who had followed him out of the boat-bay, and the six girls, who had risen on hearing their commander’s angry voice, were all tumbled into a heap. Dard surged to his feet, dragging Kyna up along with him; together, they helped the others to rise. The ship was suddenly filled with jangling bells, and the red danger-lights on the ceiling were flashing on and off.</p>
				<p>“Attention! Attention!” the voice of some officer in the control-room blared out of the intercom-speaker. “The ship has just been hit by a large meteor! All compartments between bulkheads Twelve and Thirteen are sealed off. All persons between bulkheads Twelve and Thirteen, put on oxygen helmets and plug in at the nearest phone connection. Your air is leaking, and you can’t get out, but if you put on oxygen equipment immediately, you’ll be all right. We’ll get you out as soon as we can, and in any case, we are only a few hours out of Tareeshan atmosphere. All persons in Compartment Twelve, put on.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard was swearing evilly. “That does it! That does it for good.⁠ ⁠… Anybody else in this compartment, below the living quarter level?”</p>
				<p>“No, we’re the only ones,” Analea told him.</p>
				<p>“The people above have their own boats; they can look after themselves. You girls, get in that boat, in there. Glav, you and I’ll try to warn the people above.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>There was another jar, heavier than the one which had preceded it, throwing them all down again. As they rose, a new voice was shouting over the public-address system:</p>
				<p>“<em>Abandon ship! Abandon ship!</em> The converters are backfiring, and rocket-fuel is leaking back toward the engine-rooms! An explosion is imminent! Abandon ship, all hands!”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard and Seldar Glav grabbed the girls and literally threw them through the hatch, into the rocket-boat. Dard pushed Glav in ahead of him, then jumped in. Before he had picked himself up, two or three of the girls were at the hatch, dogging the cover down.</p>
				<p>“All right, Glav, blast off!” Dard ordered. “We’ve got to be at least a hundred miles from this ship when she blows, or we’ll blow with her!”</p>
				<p>“Don’t I know!” Seldar Glav retorted over his shoulder, racing for the controls. “Grab hold of something, everybody; I’m going to fire all jets at once!”</p>
				<p>An instant later, while Kalvar Dard and the girls clung to stanchions and pieces of fixed furniture, the boat shot forward out of its housing. When Dard’s head had cleared, it was in free flight.</p>
				<p>“How was that?” Glav yelled. “Everybody all right?” He hesitated for a moment. “I think I blacked out for about ten seconds.”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard looked the girls over. Eldra was using a corner of her smock to stanch a nosebleed, and Olva had a bruise over one eye. Otherwise, everybody was in good shape.</p>
				<p>“Wonder we didn’t all black out, permanently,” he said. “Well, put on the visiscreens, and let’s see what’s going on outside. Olva, get on the radio and try to see if anybody else got away.”</p>
				<p>“Set course for Tareesh?” Glav asked. “We haven’t fuel enough to make it back to Doorsha.”</p>
				<p>“I was afraid of that,” Dard nodded. “Tareesh it is; northern hemisphere, daylight side. Try to get about the edge of the temperate zone, as near water as you can.⁠ ⁠…”</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">II</h3>
				<p>They were flung off their feet again, this time backward along the boat. As they picked themselves up, Seldar Glav was shaking his head, sadly. “That was the ship going up,” he said; “the blast must have caught us dead astern.”</p>
				<p>“All right.” Kalvar Dard rubbed a bruised forehead. “Set course for Tareesh, then cut out the jets till we’re ready to land. And get the screens on, somebody; I want to see what’s happened.”</p>
				<p>The screens glowed; then full vision came on. The planet on which they would land loomed huge before them, its north pole toward them, and its single satellite on the port side. There was no sign of any rocket-boat in either side screen, and the rear-view screen was a blur of yellow flame from the jets.</p>
				<p>“Cut the jets, Glav,” Dard repeated. “Didn’t you hear me?”</p>
				<p>“But I did, sir!” Seldar Glav indicated the firing-panel. Then he glanced at the rear-view screen. “The gods help us! It’s yellow flame; the jets are burning out!”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard had not boasted idly when he had said that his people would not panic. All the girls went white, and one or two gave low cries of consternation, but that was all.</p>
				<p>“What happens next?” Analea wanted to know. “Do we blow, too?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, as soon as the fuel-line burns up to the tanks.”</p>
				<p>“Can you land on Tareesh before then?” Dard asked.</p>
				<p>“I can try. How about the satellite? It’s closer.”</p>
				<p>“It’s also airless. Look at it and see for yourself,” Kalvar Dard advised. “Not enough mass to hold an atmosphere.”</p>
				<p>Glav looked at the army officer with new respect. He had always been inclined to think of the Frontier Guards as a gang of scientifically illiterate dirk-and-pistol bravos. He fiddled for a while with instruments on the panel; an automatic computer figured the distance to the planet, the boat’s velocity, and the time needed for a landing.</p>
				<p>“We have a chance, sir,” he said. “I think I can set down in about thirty minutes; that should give us about ten minutes to get clear of the boat, before she blows up.”</p>
				<p>“All right; get busy, girls,” Kalvar Dard said. “Grab everything we’ll need. Arms and ammunition first; all of them you can find. After that, warm clothing, bedding, tools and food.”</p>
				<p>With that, he jerked open one of the lockers and began pulling out weapons. He buckled on a pistol and dagger, and handed other weapon-belts to the girls behind him. He found two of the heavy big-game rifles, and several bandoliers of ammunition for them. He tossed out carbines, and boxes of carbine and pistol cartridges. He found two bomb-bags, each containing six light antipersonnel grenades and a big demolition-bomb. Glancing, now and then, at the forward screen, he caught glimpses of blue sky and green-tinted plains below.</p>
				<p>“All right!” the pilot yelled. “We’re coming in for a landing! A couple of you stand by to get the hatch open.”</p>
				<p>There was a jolt, and all sense of movement stopped. A cloud of white smoke drifted past the screens. The girls got the hatch open; snatching up weapons and bedding-wrapped bundles they all scrambled up out of the boat.</p>
				<p>There was fire outside. The boat had come down upon a grassy plain; now the grass was burning from the heat of the jets. One by one, they ran forward along the top of the rocket-boat, jumping down to the ground clear of the blaze. Then, with every atom of strength they possessed they ran away from the doomed boat.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The ground was rough, and the grass high, impeding them. One of the girls tripped and fell; without pausing, two others pulled her to her feet, while another snatched up and slung the carbine she had dropped. Then, ahead, Kalvar Dard saw a deep gully, through which a little stream trickled.</p>
				<p>They huddled together at the bottom of it, waiting, for what seemed like a long while. Then a gentle tremor ran through the ground, and swelled to a sickening, heaving shock. A roar of almost palpable sound swept over them, and a flash of blue-white light dimmed the sun above. The sound, the shock, and the searing light did not pass away at once; they continued for seconds that seemed like an eternity. Earth and stones pelted down around them; choking dust rose. Then the thunder and the earth-shock were over; above, incandescent vapors swirled, and darkened into an overhanging pall of smoke and dust.</p>
				<p>For a while, they crouched motionless, too stunned to speak. Then shaken nerves steadied and jarred brains cleared. They all rose weakly. Trickles of earth were still coming down from the sides of the gully, and the little stream, which had been clear and sparkling, was roiled with mud. Mechanically, Kalvar Dard brushed the dust from his clothes and looked to his weapons.</p>
				<p>“That was just the fuel-tank of a little Class-3 rocket-boat,” he said. “I wonder what the explosion of the ship was like.” He thought for a moment before continuing. “Glav, I think I know why our jets burned out. We were stern-on to the ship when she blew; the blast drove our flame right back through the jets.”</p>
				<p>“Do you think the explosion was observed from Doorsha?” Dorita inquired, more concerned about the practical aspects of the situation. “The ship, I mean. After all, we have no means of communication, of our own.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t doubt it; there were observatories all around the planet watching our ship,” Kalvar Dard said. “They probably know all about it, by now. But if any of you are thinking about the chances of rescue, forget it. We’re stuck here.”</p>
				<p>“That’s right. There isn’t another human being within fifty million miles,” Seldar Glav said. “And that was the first and only spaceship ever built. It took fifty years to build her, and even allowing twenty for research that wouldn’t have to be duplicated, you can figure when we can expect another one.”</p>
				<p>“The answer to that one is, never. The ship blew up in space; fifty years’ effort and fifteen hundred people gone, like that.” Kalvar Dard snapped his fingers. “So now, they’ll try to keep Doorsha habitable for a few more thousand years by irrigation, and forget about immigrating to Tareesh.”</p>
				<p>“Well, maybe, in a hundred thousand years, our descendants will build a ship and go to Doorsha, then,” Olva considered.</p>
				<p>“Our descendants?” Eldra looked at her in surprise. “You mean, then.⁠ ⁠… ?”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Kyna chuckled. “Eldra, you are an awful innocent, about anything that doesn’t have a breech-action or a recoil-mechanism,” she said. “Why do you think the women on this expedition outnumbered the men seven to five, and why do you think there were so many obstetricians and pediatricians in the <abbr>med.</abbr> staff? We were sent out to put a human population on Tareesh, weren’t we? Well, here we are.”</p>
				<p>“But.⁠ ⁠… Aren’t we ever going to.⁠ ⁠… ?” Varnis began. “Won’t we ever see anybody else, or do anything but just live here, like animals, without machines or ground-cars or aircraft or houses or anything?” Then she began to sob bitterly.</p>
				<p>Analea, who had been cleaning a carbine that had gotten covered with loose earth during the explosion, laid it down and went to Varnis, putting her arm around the other girl and comforting her. Kalvar Dard picked up the carbine she had laid down.</p>
				<p>“Now, let’s see,” he began. “We have two heavy rifles, six carbines, and eight pistols, and these two bags of bombs. How much ammunition, counting what’s in our belts, do we have?”</p>
				<p>They took stock of their slender resources, even Varnis joining in the task, as he had hoped she would. There were over two thousand rounds for the pistols, better than fifteen hundred for the carbines, and four hundred for the two big-game guns. They had some spare clothing, mostly spacesuit undergarments, enough bed-robes, one hand-axe, two flashlights, a first-aid kit, and three atomic lighters. Each one had a combat-dagger. There was enough tinned food for about a week.</p>
				<p>“We’ll have to begin looking for game and edible plants, right away,” Glav considered. “I suppose there is game, of some sort; but our ammunition won’t last forever.”</p>
				<p>“We’ll have to make it last as long as we can; and we’ll have to begin improvising weapons,” Dard told him. “Throwing-spears, and throwing-axes. If we can find metal, or any recognizable ore that we can smelt, we’ll use that; if not, we’ll use chipped stone. Also, we can learn to make snares and traps, after we learn the habits of the animals on this planet. By the time the ammunition’s gone, we ought to have learned to do without firearms.”</p>
				<p>“Think we ought to camp here?”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard shook his head. “No wood here for fuel, and the blast will have scared away all the game. We’d better go upstream; if we go down, we’ll find the water roiled with mud and unfit to drink. And if the game on this planet behave like the game-herds on the wastelands of Doorsha, they’ll run for high ground when frightened.”</p>
				<p>Varnis rose from where she had been sitting. Having mastered her emotions, she was making a deliberate effort to show it.</p>
				<p>“Let’s make up packs out of this stuff,” she suggested. “We can use the bedding and spare clothing to bundle up the food and ammunition.”</p>
				<p>They made up packs and slung them, then climbed out of the gully. Off to the left, the grass was burning in a wide circle around the crater left by the explosion of the rocket-boat. Kalvar Dard, carrying one of the heavy rifles, took the lead. Beside and a little behind him, Analea walked, her carbine ready. Glav, with the other heavy rifle, brought up in the rear, with Olva covering for him, and between, the other girls walked, two and two.</p>
				<p>Ahead, on the far horizon, was a distance-blue line of mountains. The little company turned their faces toward them and moved slowly away, across the empty sea of grass.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="genesis-3" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">III</h3>
				<p>They had been walking, now, for five years. Kalvar Dard still led, the heavy rifle cradled in the crook of his left arm and a sack of bombs slung from his shoulder, his eyes forever shifting to right and left searching for hidden danger. The clothes in which he had jumped from the rocket-boat were patched and ragged; his shoes had been replaced by high laced buskins of smoke-tanned hide. He was bearded, now, and his hair had been roughly trimmed with the edge of his dagger.</p>
				<p>Analea still walked beside him, but her carbine was slung, and she carried three spears with chipped flint heads; one heavy weapon, to be thrown by hand or used for stabbing, and two light javelins to be thrown with the aid of the hooked throwing-stick Glav had invented. Beside her trudged a four-year old boy, hers and Dard’s, and on her back, in a fur-lined net bag, she carried their six-month-old baby.</p>
				<p>In the rear, Glav still kept his place with the other big-game gun, and Olva walked beside him with carbine and spears; in front of them, their three-year-old daughter toddled. Between vanguard and rearguard, the rest of the party walked: Varnis, carrying her baby on her back, and Dorita, carrying a baby and leading two other children. The baby on her back had cost the life of Kyna in childbirth; one of the others had been left motherless when Eldra had been killed by the Hairy People.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>That had been two years ago, in the winter when they had used one of their two demolition-bombs to blast open a cavern in the mountains. It had been a hard winter; two children had died, then⁠—Kyna’s firstborn, and the little son of Kalvar Dard and Dorita. It had been their first encounter with the Hairy People, too.</p>
				<p>Eldra had gone outside the cave with one of the skin water-bags, to fill it at the spring. It had been after sunset, but she had carried her pistol, and no one had thought of danger until they heard the two quick shots, and the scream. They had all rushed out, to find four shaggy, manlike things tearing at Eldra with hands and teeth, another lying dead, and a sixth huddled at one side, clutching its abdomen and whimpering. There had been a quick flurry of shots that had felled all four of the assailants, and Seldar Glav had finished the wounded creature with his dagger, but Eldra was dead. They had built a cairn of stones over her body, as they had done over the bodies of the two children killed by the cold. But, after an examination to see what sort of things they were, they had tumbled the bodies of the Hairy People over the cliff. These had been too bestial to bury as befitted human dead, but too manlike to skin and eat as game.</p>
				<p>Since then, they had often found traces of the Hairy People, and when they met with them, they killed them without mercy. These were great shambling parodies of humanity, long-armed, short-legged, twice as heavy as men, with close-set reddish eyes and heavy bone-crushing jaws. They may have been incredibly debased humans, or perhaps beasts on the very threshold of manhood. From what he had seen of conditions on this planet, Kalvar Dard suspected the latter to be the case. In a million or so years, they might evolve into something like humanity. Already, the Hairy ones had learned the use of fire, and of chipped crude stone implements⁠—mostly heavy triangular choppers to be used in the hand, without helves.</p>
				<p>Twice, after that night, the Hairy People had attacked them⁠—once while they were on the march, and once in camp. Both assaults had been beaten off without loss to themselves, but at cost of precious ammunition. Once they had caught a band of ten of them swimming a river on logs; they had picked them all off from the bank with their carbines. Once, when Kalvar Dard and Analea had been scouting alone, they had come upon a dozen of them huddled around a fire and had wiped them out with a single grenade. Once, a large band of Hairy People hunted them for two days, but only twice had they come close, and both times, a single shot had sent them all scampering. That had been after the bombing of the group around the fire. Dard was convinced that the beings possessed the rudiments of a language, enough to communicate a few simple ideas, such as the fact that this little tribe of aliens were dangerous in the extreme.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>There were Hairy People about now; for the past five days, moving northward through the forest to the open grasslands, the people of Kalvar Dard had found traces of them. Now, as they came out among the seedling growth at the edge of the open plains, everybody was on the alert.</p>
				<p>They emerged from the big trees and stopped among the young growth, looking out into the open country. About a mile away, a herd of game was grazing slowly westward. In the distance, they looked like the little horse-like things, no higher than a man’s waist and heavily maned and bearded, that had been one of their most important sources of meat. For the ten thousandth time, Dard wished, as he strained his eyes, that somebody had thought to secure a pair of binoculars when they had abandoned the rocket-boat. He studied the grazing herd for a long time.</p>
				<p>The seedling pines extended almost to the game-herd and would offer concealment for the approach, but the animals were grazing into the wind, and their scent was much keener than their vision. This would preclude one of their favorite hunting techniques, that of lurking in the high grass ahead of the quarry. It had rained heavily in the past few days, and the undermat of dead grass was soaked, making a fire-hunt impossible. Kalvar Dard knew that he could stalk to within easy carbine-shot, but he was unwilling to use cartridges on game; and in view of the proximity of Hairy People, he did not want to divide his band for a drive hunt.</p>
				<p>“What’s the scheme?” Analea asked him, realizing the problem as well as he did. “Do we try to take them from behind?”</p>
				<p>“We’ll take them from an angle,” he decided. “We’ll start from here and work in, closing on them at the rear of the herd. Unless the wind shifts on us, we ought to get within spear-cast. You and I will use the spears; Varnis can come along and cover for us with a carbine. Glav, you and Olva and Dorita stay here with the children and the packs. Keep a sharp lookout; Hairy People around, somewhere.” He unslung his rifle and exchanged it for Olva’s spears. “We can only eat about two of them before the meat begins to spoil, but kill all you can,” he told Analea; “we need the skins.”</p>
				<p>Then he and the two girls began their slow, cautious, stalk. As long as the grassland was dotted with young trees, they walked upright, making good time, but the last five hundred yards they had to crawl, stopping often to check the wind, while the horse-herd drifted slowly by. Then they were directly behind the herd, with the wind in their faces, and they advanced more rapidly.</p>
				<p>“Close enough?” Dard whispered to Analea.</p>
				<p>“Yes; I’m taking the one that’s lagging a little behind.”</p>
				<p>“I’m taking the one on the left of it.” Kalvar Dard fitted a javelin to the hook of his throwing-stick. “Ready? Now!”</p>
				<p>He leaped to his feet, drawing back his right arm and hurling, the throwing-stick giving added velocity to the spear. Beside him, he was conscious of Analea rising and propelling her spear. His missile caught the little bearded pony in the chest; it stumbled and fell forward to its front knees. He snatched another light spear, set it on the hook of the stick and darted it at another horse, which reared, biting at the spear with its teeth. Grabbing the heavy stabbing-spear, he ran forward, finishing it off with a heart-thrust. As he did, Varnis slung her carbine, snatched a stone-headed throwing axe from her belt, and knocked down another horse, then ran forward with her dagger to finish it.</p>
				<p>By this time, the herd, alarmed, had stampeded and was galloping away, leaving the dead and dying behind. He and Analea had each killed two; with the one Varnis had knocked down, that made five. Using his dagger, he finished off one that was still kicking on the ground, and then began pulling out the throwing-spears. The girls, shouting in unison, were announcing the successful completion of the hunt; Glav, Olva, and Dorita were coming forward with the children.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>It was sunset by the time they had finished the work of skinning and cutting up the horses and had carried the hide-wrapped bundles of meat to the little brook where they had intended camping. There was firewood to be gathered, and the meal to be cooked, and they were all tired.</p>
				<p>“We can’t do this very often, any more,” Kalvar Dard told them, “but we might as well, tonight. Don’t bother rubbing sticks for fire; I’ll use the lighter.”</p>
				<p>He got it from a pouch on his belt⁠—a small, gold-plated, atomic lighter, bearing the crest of his old regiment of the Frontier Guards. It was the last one they had, in working order. Piling a handful of dry splinters under the firewood, he held the lighter to it, pressed the activator, and watched the fire eat into the wood.</p>
				<p>The greatest achievement of man’s civilization, the mastery of the basic, cosmic, power of the atom⁠—being used to kindle a fire of natural fuel, to cook unseasoned meat killed with stone-tipped spears. Dard looked sadly at the twinkling little gadget, then slipped it back into its pouch. Soon it would be worn out, like the other two, and then they would gain fire only by rubbing dry sticks, or hacking sparks from bits of flint or pyrites. Soon, too, the last cartridge would be fired, and then they would perforce depend for protection, as they were already doing for food, upon their spears.</p>
				<p>And they were so helpless. Six adults, burdened with seven little children, all of them requiring momently care and watchfulness. If the cartridges could be made to last until they were old enough to fend for themselves.⁠ ⁠… If they could avoid collisions with the Hairy People.⁠ ⁠… Some day, they would be numerous enough for effective mutual protection and support; some day, the ratio of helpless children to able adults would redress itself. Until then, all that they could do would be to survive; day after day, they must follow the game-herds.</p>

			<section id="genesis-4" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">IV</h3>
				<p>For twenty years, now, they had been following the game. Winters had come, with driving snow, forcing horses and deer into the woods, and the little band of humans to the protection of mountain caves. Springtime followed, with fresh grass on the plains and plenty of meat for the people of Kalvar Dard. Autumns followed summers, with fire-hunts, and the smoking and curing of meat and hides. Winters followed autumns, and springtimes came again, and thus until the twentieth year after the landing of the rocket-boat.</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard still walked in the lead, his hair and beard flecked with gray, but he no longer carried the heavy rifle; the last cartridge for that had been fired long ago. He carried the hand-axe, fitted with a long helve, and a spear with a steel head that had been worked painfully from the receiver of a useless carbine. He still had his pistol, with eight cartridges in the magazine, and his dagger, and the bomb-bag, containing the big demolition-bomb and one grenade. The last shred of clothing from the ship was gone, now; he was clad in a sleeveless tunic of skin and horsehide buskins.</p>
				<p>Analea no longer walked beside him; eight years before, she had broken her back in a fall. It had been impossible to move her, and she stabbed herself with her dagger to save a cartridge. Seldar Glav had broken through the ice while crossing a river, and had lost his rifle; the next day he died of the chill he had taken. Olva had been killed by the Hairy People, the night they had attacked the camp, when Varnis’ child had been killed.</p>
				<p>They had beaten off that attack, shot or speared ten of the huge sub-men, and the next morning they buried their dead after their custom, under cairns of stone. Varnis had watched the burial of her child with blank, uncomprehending eyes, then she had turned to Kalvar Dard and said something that had horrified him more than any wild outburst of grief could have.</p>
				<p>“Come on, Dard; what are we doing this for? You promised you’d take us to Tareesh, where we’d have good houses, and machines, and all sorts of lovely things to eat and wear. I don’t like this place, Dard; I want to go to Tareesh.”</p>
				<p>From that day on, she had wandered in merciful darkness. She had not been idiotic, or raving mad; she had just escaped from a reality that she could no longer bear.</p>
				<p>Varnis, lost in her dreamworld, and Dorita, hard-faced and haggard, were the only ones left, beside Kalvar Dard, of the original eight. But the band had grown, meanwhile, to more than fifteen. In the rear, in Seldar Glav’s old place, the son of Kalvar Dard and Analea walked. Like his father, he wore a pistol, for which he had six rounds, and a dagger, and in his hand he carried a stone-headed killing-maul with a three-foot handle which he had made for himself. The woman who walked beside him and carried his spears was the daughter of Glav and Olva; in a net-bag on her back she carried their infant child. The first Tareeshan born of Tareeshan parents; Kalvar Dard often looked at his little grandchild during nights in camp and days on the trail, seeing, in that tiny fur-swaddled morsel of humanity, the meaning and purpose of all that he did. Of the older girls, one or two were already pregnant, now; this tiny threatened beachhead of humanity was expanding, gaining strength. Long after man had died out on Doorsha and the dying planet itself had become an arid waste, the progeny of this little band would continue to grow and to dominate the younger planet, nearer the sun. Some day, an even mightier civilization than the one he had left would rise here.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>All day the trail had wound upward into the mountains. Great cliffs loomed above them, and little streams spumed and dashed in rocky gorges below. All day, the Hairy People had followed, fearful to approach too close, unwilling to allow their enemies to escape. It had started when they had rushed the camp, at daybreak; they had been beaten off, at cost of almost all the ammunition, and the death of one child. No sooner had the tribe of Kalvar Dard taken the trail, however, than they had been pressing after them. Dard had determined to cross the mountains, and had led his people up a game-trail, leading toward the notch of a pass high against the skyline.</p>
				<p>The shaggy ape-things seemed to have divined his purpose. Once or twice, he had seen hairy brown shapes dodging among the rocks and stunted trees to the left. They were trying to reach the pass ahead of him. Well, if they did.⁠ ⁠… He made a quick mental survey of his resources. His pistol, and his son’s, and Dorita’s, with eight, and six, and seven rounds. One grenade, and the big demolition bomb, too powerful to be thrown by hand, but which could be set for delayed explosion and dropped over a cliff or left behind to explode among pursuers. Five steel daggers, and plenty of spears and slings and axes. Himself, his son and his son’s woman, Dorita, and four or five of the older boys and girls, who would make effective front-line fighters. And Varnis, who might come out of her private dreamworld long enough to give account for herself, and even the tiniest of the walking children could throw stones or light spears. Yes, they could force the pass, if the Hairy People reached it ahead of them, and then seal it shut with the heavy bomb. What lay on the other side, he did not know; he wondered how much game there would be, and if there were Hairy People on that side, too.</p>
				<p>Two shots slammed quickly behind him. He dropped his axe and took a two-hand grip on his stabbing-spear as he turned. His son was hurrying forward, his pistol drawn, glancing behind as he came.</p>
				<p>“Hairy People. Four,” he reported. “I shot two; she threw a spear and killed another. The other ran.”</p>
				<p>The daughter of Seldar Glav and Olva nodded in agreement.</p>
				<p>“I had no time to throw again,” she said, “and Bo-Bo would not shoot the one that ran.”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard’s son, who had no other name than the one his mother had called him as a child, defended himself. “He was running away. It is the rule: <em>use bullets only to save life, where a spear will not serve</em>.”</p>
				<p>Kalvar Dard nodded. “You did right, son,” he said, taking out his own pistol and removing the magazine, from which he extracted two cartridges. “Load these into your pistol; four rounds aren’t enough. Now we each have six. Go back to the rear, keep the little ones moving, and don’t let Varnis get behind.”</p>
				<p>“That is right. <em>We must all look out for Varnis, and take care of her</em>,” the boy recited obediently. “That is the rule.”</p>
				<p>He dropped to the rear. Kalvar Dard holstered his pistol and picked up his axe, and the column moved forward again. They were following a ledge, now; on the left, there was a sheer drop of several hundred feet, and on the right a cliff rose above them, growing higher and steeper as the trail slanted upward. Dard was worried about the ledge; if it came to an end, they would all be trapped. No one would escape. He suddenly felt old and unutterably weary. It was a frightful weight that he bore⁠—responsibility for an entire race.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Suddenly, behind him, Dorita fired her pistol upward. Dard sprang forward⁠—there was no room for him to jump aside⁠—and drew his pistol. The boy, Bo-Bo, was trying to find a target from his position in the rear. Then Dard saw the two Hairy People; the boy fired, and the stone fell, all at once.</p>
				<p>It was a heavy stone, half as big as a man’s torso, and it almost missed Kalvar Dard. If it had hit him directly, it would have killed him instantly, mashing him to a bloody pulp; as it was, he was knocked flat, the stone pinning his legs.</p>
				<p>At Bo-Bo’s shot, a hairy body plummeted down, to hit the ledge. Bo-Bo’s woman instantly ran it through with one of her spears. The other ape-thing, the one Dorita had shot, was still clinging to a rock above. Two of the children scampered up to it and speared it repeatedly, screaming like little furies. Dorita and one of the older girls got the rock off Kalvar Dard’s legs and tried to help him to his feet, but he collapsed, unable to stand. Both his legs were broken.</p>
				<p>This was it, he thought, sinking back. “Dorita, I want you to run ahead and see what the trail’s like,” he said. “See if the ledge is passable. And find a place, not too far ahead, where we can block the trail by exploding that demolition-bomb. It has to be close enough for a couple of you to carry or drag me and get me there in one piece.”</p>
				<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>
				<p>“What do you think?” he retorted. “I have both legs broken. You can’t carry me with you; if you try it, they’ll catch us and kill us all. I’ll have to stay behind; I’ll block the trail behind you, and get as many of them as I can, while I’m at it. Now, run along and do as I said.”</p>
				<p>She nodded. “I’ll be back as soon as I can,” she agreed.</p>
				<p>The others were crowding around Dard. Bo-Bo bent over him, perplexed and worried. “What are you going to do, father?” he asked. “You are hurt. Are you going to go away and leave us, as mother did when she was hurt?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, son; I’ll have to. You carry me on ahead a little, when Dorita gets back, and leave me where she shows you to. I’m going to stay behind and block the trail, and kill a few Hairy People. I’ll use the big bomb.”</p>
				<p>“The <em>big</em> bomb? The one nobody dares throw?” The boy looked at his father in wonder.</p>
				<p>“That’s right. Now, when you leave me, take the others and get away as fast as you can. Don’t stop till you’re up to the pass. Take my pistol and dagger, and the axe and the big spear, and take the little bomb, too. Take everything I have, only leave the big bomb with me. I’ll need that.”</p>
				<p>Dorita rejoined them. “There’s a waterfall ahead. We can get around it, and up to the pass. The way’s clear and easy; if you put off the bomb just this side of it, you’ll start a rock-slide that’ll block everything.”</p>
				<p>“All right. Pick me up, a couple of you. Don’t take hold of me below the knees. And hurry.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>A hairy shape appeared on the ledge below them; one of the older boys used his throwing-stick to drive a javelin into it. Two of the girls picked up Dard; Bo-Bo and his woman gathered up the big spear and the axe and the bomb-bag.</p>
				<p>They hurried forward, picking their way along the top of a talus of rubble at the foot of the cliff, and came to where the stream gushed out of a narrow gorge. The air was wet with spray there, and loud with the roar of the waterfall. Kalvar Dard looked around; Dorita had chosen the spot well. Not even a surefooted mountain-goat could make the ascent, once that gorge was blocked.</p>
				<p>“All right; put me down here,” he directed. “Bo-Bo, take my belt, and give me the big bomb. You have one light grenade; know how to use it?”</p>
				<p>“Of course, you have often showed me. I turn the top, and then press in the little thing on the side, and hold it in till I throw. I throw it at least a spear-cast, and drop to the ground or behind something.”</p>
				<p>“That’s right. And use it only in greatest danger, to save everybody. Spare your cartridges; use them only to save life. And save everything of metal, no matter how small.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Those are the rules. I will follow them, and so will the others. And we will always take care of Varnis.”</p>
				<p>“Well, goodbye, son.” He gripped the boy’s hand. “Now get everybody out of here; don’t stop till you’re at the pass.”</p>
				<p>“You’re not staying behind!” Varnis cried. “Dard, you promised us! I remember, when we were all in the ship together⁠—you and I and Analea and Olva and Dorita and Eldra and, oh, what was that other girl’s name, Kyna! And we were all having such a nice time, and you were telling us how we’d all come to Tareesh, and we were having such fun talking about it.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“That’s right, Varnis,” he agreed. “And so I will. I have something to do, here, but I’ll meet you on top of the mountain, after I’m through, and in the morning we’ll all go to Tareesh.”</p>
				<p>She smiled⁠—the gentle, childlike smile of the harmlessly mad⁠—and turned away. The son of Kalvar Dard made sure that she and all the children were on the way, and then he, too, turned and followed them, leaving Dard alone.</p>
				<p>Alone, with a bomb and a task. He’d borne that task for twenty years, now; in a few minutes, it would be ended, with an instant’s searing heat. He tried not to be too glad; there were so many things he might have done, if he had tried harder. Metals, for instance. Somewhere there surely must be ores which they could have smelted, but he had never found them. And he might have tried catching some of the little horses they hunted for food, to break and train to bear burdens. And the alphabet⁠—why hadn’t he taught it to Bo-Bo and the daughter of Seldar Glav, and laid on them an obligation to teach the others? And the grass-seeds they used for making flour sometimes; they should have planted fields of the better kinds, and patches of edible roots, and returned at the proper time to harvest them. There were so many things, things that none of those young savages or their children would think of in ten thousand years.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>Something was moving among the rocks, a hundred yards away. He straightened, as much as his broken legs would permit, and watched. Yes, there was one of them, and there was another, and another. One rose from behind a rock and came forward at a shambling run, making bestial sounds. Then two more lumbered into sight, and in a moment the ravine was alive with them. They were almost upon him when Kalvar Dard pressed in the thumbpiece of the bomb; they were clutching at him when he released it. He felt a slight jar.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>When they reached the pass, they all stopped as the son of Kalvar Dard turned and looked back. Dorita stood beside him, looking toward the waterfall too; she also knew what was about to happen. The others merely gaped in blank incomprehension, or grasped their weapons, thinking that the enemy was pressing close behind and that they were making a stand here. A few of the smaller boys and girls began picking up stones.</p>
				<p>Then a tiny pinpoint of brilliance winked, just below where the snow-fed stream vanished into the gorge. That was all, for an instant, and then a great fire-shot cloud swirled upward, hundreds of feet into the air; there was a crash, louder than any sound any of them except Dorita and Varnis had ever heard before.</p>
				<p>“He did it!” Dorita said softly.</p>
				<p>“Yes, he did it. My father was a brave man,” Bo-Bo replied. “We are safe, now.”</p>
				<p>Varnis, shocked by the explosion, turned and stared at him, and then she laughed happily. “Why, there you are, Dard!” she exclaimed. “I was wondering where you’d gone. What did you do, after we left?”</p>
				<p>“What do you mean?” The boy was puzzled, not knowing how much he looked like his father, when his father had been an officer of the Frontier Guards, twenty years before.</p>
				<p>His puzzlement worried Varnis vaguely. “You.⁠ ⁠… You are Dard, aren’t you?” she asked. “But that’s silly; of course you’re Dard! Who else could you be?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. I am Dard,” the boy said, remembering that it was the rule for everybody to be kind to Varnis and to pretend to agree with her. Then another thought struck him. His shoulders straightened. “Yes. I am Dard, son of Dard,” he told them all. “I lead, now. Does anybody say no?”</p>
				<p>He shifted his axe and spear to his left hand and laid his right hand on the butt of his pistol, looking sternly at Dorita. If any of them tried to dispute his claim, it would be she. But instead, she gave him the nearest thing to a real smile that had crossed her face in years.</p>
				<p>“You are Dard,” she told him; “you lead us, now.”</p>
				<p>“But of course Dard leads! Hasn’t he always led us?” Varnis wanted to know. “Then what’s all the argument about? And tomorrow he’s going to take us to Tareesh, and we’ll have houses and ground-cars and aircraft and gardens and lights, and all the lovely things we want. Aren’t you, Dard?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, Varnis; I will take you all to Tareesh, to all the wonderful things,” Dard, son of Dard, promised, for such was the rule about Varnis.</p>
				<p>Then he looked down from the pass into the country beyond. There were lower mountains, below, and foothills, and a wide blue valley, and, beyond that, distant peaks reared jaggedly against the sky. He pointed with his father’s axe.</p>
				<p>“We go down that way,” he said.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>So they went, down, and on, and on, and on. The last cartridge was fired; the last sliver of Doorshan metal wore out or rusted away. By then, however, they had learned to make chipped stone, and bone, and reindeer-horn, serve their needs. Century after century, millennium after millennium, they followed the game-herds from birth to death, and birth replenished their numbers faster than death depleted. Bands grew in numbers and split; young men rebelled against the rule of the old and took their women and children elsewhere.</p>
				<p>They hunted down the hairy Neanderthalers, and exterminated them ruthlessly, the origin of their implacable hatred lost in legend. All that they remembered, in the misty, confused, way that one remembers a dream, was that there had once been a time of happiness and plenty, and that there was a goal to which they would some day attain. They left the mountains⁠—were they the Caucasus? The Alps? The Pamirs?⁠—and spread outward, conquering as they went.</p>
				<p>We find their bones, and their stone weapons, and their crude paintings, in the caves of Cro-Magnon and Grimaldi and Altimira and Mas-d’Azil; the deep layers of horse and reindeer and mammoth bones at their feasting-place at Solutre. We wonder how and whence a race so like our own came into a world of brutish subhumans.</p>
				<p>Just as we wonder, too, at the network of canals which radiate from the polar caps of our sister planet, and speculate on the possibility that they were the work of hands like our own. And we concoct elaborate jokes about the “Men From Mars”⁠—<em>ourselves</em>.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Graveyard of Dreams</h2>
			<p>Standing at the armor-glass front of the observation deck and watching the mountains rise and grow on the horizon, Conn Maxwell gripped the metal handrail with painful intensity, as though trying to hold back the airship by force. Thirty minutes⁠—twenty-six and a fraction of the Terran minutes he had become accustomed to⁠—until he’d have to face it.</p>
			<p>Then, realizing that he never, in his own thoughts, addressed himself as “sir,” he turned.</p>
			<p>“I beg your pardon?”</p>
			<p>It was the first officer, wearing a Terran Federation Space Navy uniform of forty years, or about ten regulation-changes, ago. That was the sort of thing he had taken for granted before he had gone away. Now he was noticing it everywhere.</p>
			<p>“Thirty minutes out of Litchfield, sir,” the ship’s officer repeated. “You’ll go off by the midship gangway on the starboard side.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I know. Thank you.”</p>
			<p>The first mate held out the clipboard he was carrying. “Would you mind checking over this, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Maxwell? Your baggage list.”</p>
			<p>“Certainly.” He glanced at the slip of paper. Valises, eighteen and twenty-five kilos, two; trunks, seventy-five and seventy kilos, two; microbook case, one-fifty kilos, one. The last item fanned up a little flicker of anger in him, not at any person, even himself, but at the situation in which he found himself and the futility of the whole thing.</p>
			<p>“Yes, that’s everything. I have no hand-luggage, just this stuff.”</p>
			<p>He noticed that this was the only baggage list under the clip; the other papers were all freight and express manifests. “Not many passengers left aboard, are there?”</p>
			<p>“You’re the only one in first-class, sir,” the mate replied. “About forty farm-laborers on the lower deck. Everybody else got off at the other stops. Litchfield’s the end of the run. You know anything about the place?”</p>
			<p>“I was born there. I’ve been away at school for the last five years.”</p>
			<p>“On Baldur?”</p>
			<p>“Terra. University of Montevideo.” Once Conn would have said it almost boastfully.</p>
			<p>The mate gave him a quick look of surprised respect, then grinned and nodded. “Of course; I should have known. You’re Rodney Maxwell’s son, aren’t you? Your father’s one of our regular freight shippers. Been sending out a lot of stuff lately.” He looked as though he would have liked to continue the conversation, but said: “Sorry, I’ve got to go. Lot of things to attend to before landing.” He touched the visor of his cap and turned away.</p>
			<p>The mountains were closer when Conn looked forward again, and he glanced down. Five years and two space voyages ago, seen from the afterdeck of this ship or one of her sisters, the woods had been green with new foliage, and the wine-melon fields had been in pink blossom. He tried to picture the scene sliding away below instead of drawing in toward him, as though to force himself back to a moment of the irretrievable past.</p>
			<p>But the moment was gone, and with it the eager excitement and the half-formed anticipations of the things he would learn and accomplish on Terra. The things he would learn⁠—microbook case, one-fifty kilos, one. One of the steel trunks was full of things he had learned and accomplished, too. Maybe they, at least, had some value.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>The woods were autumn-tinted now and the fields were bare and brown.</p>
			<p>They had gotten the crop in early this year, for the fields had all been harvested. Those workers below must be going out for the wine-pressing. That extra hands were needed for that meant a big crop, and yet it seemed that less land was under cultivation than when he had gone away. He could see squares of low brush among the new forests that had grown up in the last forty years, and the few stands of original timber looked like hills above the second growth. Those trees had been standing when the planet had been colonized.</p>
			<p>That had been two hundred years ago, at the middle of the Seventh Century, Atomic Era. The name of the planet⁠—Poictesme⁠—told that: the Surromanticist Movement, when the critics and professors were rediscovering James Branch Cabell.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Funny how much was coming back to him now⁠—things he had picked up from the minimal liberal-arts and general-humanities courses he had taken and then forgotten in his absorption with the science and tech studies.</p>
			<p>The first extrasolar planets, as they had been discovered, had been named from Norse mythology⁠—Odin and Baldur and Thor, Uller and Freya, Bifrost and Asgard and Niflheim. When the Norse names ran out, the discoverers had turned to other mythologies, Celtic and Egyptian and Hindu and Assyrian, and by the middle of the Seventh Century they were naming planets for almost anything.</p>
			<p>Anything, that is, but actual persons; their names were reserved for stars. Like Alpha Gartner, the sun of Poictesme, and Beta Gartner, a buckshot-sized pink glow in the southeast, and Gamma Gartner, out of sight on the other side of the world, all named for old Genji Gartner, the scholarly and half-piratical adventurer whose ship had been the first to approach the three stars and discover that each of them had planets.</p>
			<p>Forty-two planets in all, from a couple of methane-giants on Gamma to airless little things with one-sixth Terran gravity. Alpha <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> had been the only one in the Trisystem with an oxygen atmosphere and life. So Gartner had landed on it, and named it Poictesme, and the settlement that had grown up around the first landing site had been called Storisende. Thirty years later, Genji Gartner died there, after seeing the camp grow to a metropolis, and was buried under a massive monument.</p>
			<p>Some of the other planets had been rich in metals, and mines had been opened, and atmosphere-domed factories and processing plants built. None of them could produce anything but hydroponic and tissue-culture foodstuffs, and natural foods from Poictesme had been less expensive, even on the planets of Gamma and Beta. So Poictesme had concentrated on agriculture and grown wealthy at it.</p>
			<p>Then, within fifty years of Genji Gartner’s death, the economics of interstellar trade overtook the Trisystem and the mines and factories closed down. It was no longer possible to ship the output to a profitable market, in the face of the growing self-sufficiency of the colonial planets and the irreducibly high cost of space-freighting.</p>
			<p>Below, the brown fields and the red and yellow woods were merging into a ten-mile-square desert of crumbling concrete⁠—empty and roofless sheds and warehouses and barracks, brush-choked parade grounds and landing fields, airship docks, and even a spaceport. They were more recent, dating from Poictesme’s second brief and hectic prosperity, when the Terran Federation’s Third Fleet-Army Force had occupied the Gartner Trisystem during the System States War.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Millions of troops had been stationed on or routed through Poictesme; tens of thousands of spacecraft had been based on the Trisystem; the mines and factories had reopened for war production. The Federation had spent trillions of sols on Poictesme, piled up mountains of stores and arms and equipment, left the face of the planet cluttered with installations.</p>
			<p>Then, ten years before anybody had expected it, the rebellious System States Alliance had collapsed and the war had ended. The Federation armies had gone home, taking with them the clothes they stood in, their personal weapons and a few souvenirs. Everything else had been left behind; even the most expensive equipment was worth less than the cost of removal.</p>
			<p>Ever since, Poictesme had been living on salvage. The uniform the first officer was wearing was forty years old⁠—and it was barely a month out of the original packing. On Terra, Conn had told his friends that his father was a prospector and let them interpret that as meaning an explorer for, say, uranium deposits. Rodney Maxwell found plenty of uranium, but he got it by taking apart the warheads of missiles.</p>
			<p>The old replacement depot or classification center or training area or whatever it had been had vanished under the ship now and it was all forest back to the mountains, with an occasional cluster of deserted buildings. From one or two, threads of blue smoke rose⁠—bands of farm tramps, camping on their way from harvest to wine-pressing. Then the eastern foothills were out of sight and he was looking down on the granite spines of the Calder Range; the valley beyond was sloping away and widening out in the distance, and it was time he began thinking of what to say when he landed. He would have to tell them, of course.</p>
			<p>He wondered who would be at the dock to meet him, besides his family. Lynne Fawzi, he hoped. Or did he? Her parents would be with her, and Kurt Fawzi would take the news hardest of any of them, and be the first to blame him because it was bad. The hopes he had built for Lynne and himself would have to be held in abeyance till he saw how her father would regard him now.</p>
			<p>But however any of them took it, he would have to tell them the truth.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The ship swept on, tearing through the thin puffs of cloud at ten miles a minute. Six minutes to landing. Five. Four. Then he saw the river bend, glinting redly through the haze in the sunlight; Litchfield was inside it, and he stared waiting for the first glimpse of the city. Three minutes, and the ship began to cut speed and lose altitude. The hot-jets had stopped firing and he could hear the whine of the cold-jet rotors.</p>
			<p>Then he could see Litchfield, dominated by the Airport Building, so thick that it looked squat for all its height, like a candle-stump in a puddle of its own grease, the other buildings under their carapace of terraces and landing stages seeming to have flowed away from it. And there was the yellow block of the distilleries, and High Garden Terrace, and the Mall.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>At first, in the distance, it looked like a living city. Then, second by second, the stigmata of decay became more and more evident. Terraces empty or littered with rubbish; gardens untended and choked with wild growth; windows staring blindly; walls splotched with lichens and grimy where the rains could not wash them.</p>
			<p>For a moment, he was afraid that some disaster, unmentioned in his father’s letters, had befallen. Then he realized that the change had not been in Litchfield but in himself. After five years, he was seeing it as it really was. He wondered how his family and his friends would look to him now. Or Lynne.</p>
			<p>The ship was coming in over the Mall; he could see the cracked paving sprouting grass, the statues askew on their pedestals, the waterless fountains. He thought for an instant that one of them was playing, and then he saw that what he had taken for spray was dust blowing from the empty basin. There was something about dusty fountains, something he had learned at the University. Oh, yes. One of the Second Century Martian Colonial poets, Eirrarsson, or somebody like that:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>The fountains are dusty in the Graveyard of Dreams;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hinges are rusty and swing with tiny screams.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>There was more to it, but he couldn’t remember; something about empty gardens under an empty sky. There must have been colonies inside the Sol System, before the Interstellar Era, that hadn’t turned out any better than Poictesme. Then he stopped trying to remember as the ship turned toward the Airport Building and a couple of tugs⁠—Terran Federation contragravity tanks, with derrick-booms behind and push-poles where the guns had been⁠—came up to bring her down.</p>
			<p>He walked along the starboard promenade to the gangway, which the first mate and a couple of airmen were getting open.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Most of the population of top-level Litchfield was in the crowd on the dock. He recognized old Colonel Zareff, with his white hair and plum-brown skin, and Tom Brangwyn, the town marshal, red-faced and bulking above the others. It took a few seconds for him to pick out his father and mother, and his sister Flora, and then to realize that the handsome young man beside Flora was his brother Charley. Charley had been thirteen when Conn had gone away. And there was Kurt Fawzi, the mayor of Litchfield, and there was Lynne, beside him, her red-lipped face tilted upward with a cloud of bright hair behind it.</p>
			<p>He waved to her, and she waved back, jumping in excitement, and then everybody was waving, and they were pushing his family to the front and making way for them.</p>
			<p>The ship touched down lightly and gave a lurch as she went off contragravity, and they got the gangway open and the steps swung out, and he started down toward the people who had gathered to greet him.</p>
			<p>His father was wearing the same black best-suit he had worn when they had parted five years ago. It had been new then; now it was shabby and had acquired a permanent wrinkle across the right hip, over the pistol-butt. Charley was carrying a gun, too; the belt and holster looked as though he had made them himself. His mother’s dress was new and so was Flora’s⁠—probably made for the occasion. He couldn’t be sure just which of the Terran Federation services had provided the material, but Charley’s shirt was Medical Service sterilon.</p>
			<p>Ashamed that he was noticing and thinking of such things at a time like this, he clasped his father’s hand and kissed his mother and Flora. Everybody was talking at once, saying things that he heard only as happy sounds. His brother’s words were the first that penetrated as words.</p>
			<p>“You didn’t know me,” Charley was accusing. “Don’t deny it; I saw you standing there wondering if I was Flora’s new boy friend or what.”</p>
			<p>“Well, how in Niflheim’d you expect me to? You’ve grown up since the last time I saw you. You’re looking great, kid!” He caught the gleam of Lynne’s golden hair beyond Charley’s shoulder and pushed him gently aside. “Lynne!”</p>
			<p>“Conn, you look just wonderful!” Her arms were around his neck and she was kissing him. “Am I still your girl, Conn?”</p>
			<p>He crushed her against him and returned her kisses, assuring her that she was. He wasn’t going to let it make a bit of difference how her father took the news⁠—if she didn’t.</p>
			<p>She babbled on: “You didn’t get mixed up with any of those girls on Terra, did you? If you did, don’t tell me about it. All I care about is that you’re back. Oh, Conn, you don’t know how much I missed you.⁠ ⁠… Mother, Dad, doesn’t he look just splendid?”</p>
			<p>Kurt Fawzi, a little thinner, his face more wrinkled, his hair grayer, shook his hand.</p>
			<p>“I’m just as glad to see you as anybody, Conn,” he said, “even if I’m not being as demonstrative about it as Lynne. Judge, what do you think of our returned wanderer? Franz, shake hands with him, but save the interview for the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">News</i> for later. Professor, here’s one student Litchfield Academy won’t need to be ashamed of.”</p>
			<p>He shook hands with them⁠—old Judge Ledue; Franz Veltrin, the newsman; Professor Kellton; a dozen others, some of whom he had not thought of in five years. They were all cordial and happy⁠—how much, he wondered, because he was their neighbor, Conn Maxwell, Rodney Maxwell’s son, home from Terra, and how much because of what they hoped he would tell them? Kurt Fawzi, edging him out of the crowd, was the first to voice that.</p>
			<p>“Conn, what did you find out?” he asked breathlessly. “Do you know where it is?”</p>
			<p>Conn hesitated, looking about desperately; this was no time to start talking to Kurt Fawzi about it. His father was turning toward him from one side, and from the other Tom Brangwyn and Colonel Zareff were approaching more slowly, the older man leaning on a silver-headed cane.</p>
			<p>“Don’t bother him about it now, Kurt,” Rodney Maxwell scolded the mayor. “He’s just gotten off the ship; he hasn’t had time to say hello to everybody yet.”</p>
			<p>“But, Rod, I’ve been waiting to hear what he’s found out ever since he went away,” Fawzi protested in a hurt tone.</p>
			<p>Brangwyn and Colonel Zareff joined them. They were close friends, probably because neither of them was a native of Poictesme.</p>
			<p>The town marshal had always been reticent about his origins, but Conn guessed it was Hathor. Brangwyn’s heavy-muscled body, and his ease and grace in handling it, marked him as a man of a high-gravity planet. Besides, Hathor had a permanent cloud-envelope, and Tom Brangwyn’s skin had turned boiled-lobster red under the dim orange sunlight of Alpha Gartner.</p>
			<p>Old Klem Zareff never hesitated to tell anybody where he came from⁠—he was from Ashmodai, one of the System States planets, and he had commanded a division that had been blasted down to about regimental strength, in the Alliance army.</p>
			<p>“Hello, boy,” he croaked, extending a trembling hand. “Glad you’re home. We all missed you.”</p>
			<p>“We sure did, Conn,” the town marshal agreed, clasping Conn’s hand as soon as the old man had released it. “Find out anything definite?”</p>
			<p>Kurt Fawzi looked at his watch. “Conn, we’ve planned a little celebration for you. We only had since day before yesterday, when the spaceship came into radio range, but we’re having a dinner party for you at Senta’s this evening.”</p>
			<p>“You couldn’t have done anything I’d have liked better, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fawzi. I’d have to have a meal at Senta’s before really feeling that I’d come home.”</p>
			<p>“Well, here’s what I have in mind. It’ll be three hours till dinner’s ready. Suppose we all go up to my office in the meantime. It’ll give the ladies a chance to go home and fix up for the party, and we can have a drink and a talk.”</p>
			<p>“You want to do that, Conn?” his father asked, a trifle doubtfully. “If you’d rather go home first.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Something in his father’s voice and manner disturbed him vaguely; however, he nodded agreement. After a couple of drinks, he’d be better able to tell them.</p>
			<p>“Yes, indeed, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fawzi,” Conn said. “I know you’re all anxious, but it’s a long story. This’ll be a good chance to tell you.”</p>
			<p>Fawzi turned to his wife and daughter, interrupting himself to shout instructions to a couple of dockhands who were floating the baggage off the ship on a contragravity-lifter. Conn’s father had sent Charley off with a message to his mother and Flora.</p>
			<p>Conn turned to Colonel Zareff. “I noticed extra workers coming out from the hiring agencies in Storisende, and the crop was all in across the Calders. Big wine-pressing this year?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, we’re up to our necks in melons,” the old planter grumbled. “Gehenna of a big crop. Price’ll drop like a brick of collapsium, and this time next year we’ll be using brandy to wash our feet in.”</p>
			<p>“If you can’t get good prices, hang onto it and age it. I wish you could see what the bars on Terra charge for a drink of ten-year-old Poictesme.”</p>
			<p>“This isn’t Terra and we aren’t selling it by the drink. Only place we can sell brandy is at Storisende spaceport, and we have to take what the trading-ship captains offer. You’ve been on a rich planet for the last five years, Conn. You’ve forgotten what it’s like to live in a poorhouse. And that’s what Poictesme is.”</p>
			<p>“Things’ll be better from now on, Klem,” the mayor said, putting one hand on the old man’s shoulder and the other on Conn’s. “Our boy’s home. With what he can tell us, we’ll be able to solve all our problems. Come on, let’s go up and hear about it.”</p>
			<p>They entered the wide doorway of the warehouse on the dock-level floor of the Airport Building and crossed to the lift. About a dozen others had joined them, all the important men of Litchfield. Inside, Kurt Fawzi’s laborers were floating out cargo for the ship⁠—casks of brandy, of course, and a lot of boxes and crates painted light blue and marked with the wreathed globe of the Terran Federation and the gold triangle of the Third Fleet-Army Force and the eight-pointed red star of Ordnance Service. Long cases of rifles, square boxes of ammunition, machine guns, crated auto-cannon and rockets.</p>
			<p>“Where’d that stuff come from?” Conn asked his father. “You dig it up?”</p>
			<p>His father chuckled. “That happened since the last time I wrote you. Remember the big underground headquarters complex in the Calders? Everybody thought it had been all cleaned out years ago. You know, it’s never a mistake to take a second look at anything that everybody believes. I found a lot of sealed-off sections over there that had never been entered. This stuff’s from one of the headquarters defense armories. I have a gang getting the stuff out. Charley and I flew in after lunch, and I’m going back the first thing tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“But there’s enough combat equipment on hand to outfit a private army for every man, woman and child on Poictesme!” Conn objected. “Where are we going to sell this?”</p>
			<p>“Storisende spaceport. The tramp freighters are buying it for newly colonized planets that haven’t been industrialized yet. They don’t pay much, but it doesn’t cost much to get it out, and I’ve been clearing about three hundred sols a ton on the spaceport docks. That’s not bad, you know.”</p>
			<p>Three hundred sols a ton. A lifter went by stacked with cases of M-504 submachine guns. Unloaded, one of them weighed six pounds, and even a used one was worth a hundred sols. Conn started to say something about that, but then they came to the lift and were crowding onto it.</p>
			<p>He had been in Kurt Fawzi’s office a few times, always with his father, and he remembered it as a dim, quiet place of genteel conviviality and rambling conversations, with deep, comfortable chairs and many ashtrays. Fawzi’s warehouse and brokerage business, and the airline agency, and the government, such as it was, of Litchfield, combined, made few demands on his time and did not prevent the office from being a favored loafing center for the town’s elders. The lights were bright only over the big table that served, among other things, as a desk, and the walls were almost invisible in the shadows.</p>
			<p>As they came down the hallway from the lift, everybody had begun speaking more softly. Voices were never loud or excited in Kurt Fawzi’s office.</p>
			<p>Tom Brangwyn went to the table, taking off his belt and holster and laying his pistol aside. The others, crowding into the room, added their weapons to his.</p>
			<p>That was something else Conn was seeing with new eyes. It had been five years since he had carried a gun and he was wondering why any of them bothered. A gun was what a boy put on to show that he had reached manhood, and a man carried for the rest of his life out of habit.</p>
			<p>Why, there wouldn’t be a shooting a year in Litchfield, if you didn’t count the farm tramps and drifters, who kept to the lower level or camped in the empty buildings at the edge of town. Or maybe that was it; maybe Litchfield was peaceful because everybody was armed. It certainly wasn’t because of anything the Planetary Government at Storisende did to maintain order.</p>
			<p>After divesting himself of his gun, Tom Brangwyn took over the bartending, getting out glasses and filling a pitcher of brandy from a keg in the corner.</p>
			<p>“Everybody supplied?” Fawzi was asking. “Well, let’s drink to our returned emissary. We’re all anxious to hear what you found out, Conn. Gentlemen, here’s to our friend Conn Maxwell. Welcome home, Conn!”</p>
			<p>“Well, it’s wonderful to be back, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Fawzi⁠—”</p>
			<p>“No, let’s not have any of this mister foolishness! You’re one of the gang now. And drink up, everybody. We have plenty of brandy, even if we don’t have anything else.”</p>
			<p>“You telling us, Kurt?” somebody demanded. One of the distillery company; the name would come back to Conn in a moment. “When this crop gets pressed and fermented⁠—”</p>
			<p>“When I start pressing, I don’t know where in Gehenna I’m going to vat the stuff till it ferments,” Colonel Zareff said. “Or why. You won’t be able to handle all of it.”</p>
			<p>“Now, now!” Fawzi reproved. “Let’s not start moaning about our troubles. Not the day Conn’s come home. Not when he’s going to tell us how to find the Third Fleet-Army Force Brain.”</p>
			<p>“You <em>did</em> find out where the Brain is, didn’t you, Conn?” Brangwyn asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>That set half a dozen of them off at once. They had all sat down after the toast; now they were fidgeting in their chairs, leaning forward, looking at Conn fixedly.</p>
			<p>“What did you find out, Conn?”</p>
			<p>“It’s still here on Poictesme, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“Did you find out where it is?”</p>
			<p>He wanted to tell them in one quick sentence and get it over with. He couldn’t, any more than he could force himself to squeeze the trigger of a pistol he knew would blow up in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Wait a minute, gentlemen.” He finished the brandy, and held out the glass to Tom Brangwyn, nodding toward the pitcher. Even the first drink had warmed him and he could feel the constriction easing in his throat and the lump at the pit of his stomach dissolving. “I hope none of you expect me to spread out a map and show you the cross on it, where the Brain is. I can’t. I can’t even give the approximate location of the thing.”</p>
			<p>Much of the happy eagerness drained out of the faces around him. Some of them were looking troubled; Colonel Zareff was gnawing the bottom of his mustache, and Judge Ledue’s hand shook as he tried to relight his cigar. Conn stole a quick side-glance at his father; Rodney Maxwell was watching him curiously, as though wondering what he was going to say next.</p>
			<p>“But it is still here on Poictesme?” Fawzi questioned. “They didn’t take it away when they evacuated, did they?”</p>
			<p>Conn finished his second drink. This time he picked up the pitcher and refilled for himself.</p>
			<p>“I’m going to have to do a lot of talking,” he said, “and it’s going to be thirsty work. I’ll have to tell you the whole thing from the beginning, and if you start asking questions at random, you’ll get me mixed up and I’ll miss the important points.”</p>
			<p>“By all means!” Judge Ledue told him. “Give it in your own words, in what you think is the proper order.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you, Judge.”</p>
			<p>Conn drank some more brandy, hoping he could get his courage up without getting drunk. After all, they had a right to a full report; all of them had contributed something toward sending him to Terra.</p>
			<p>“The main purpose in my going to the University was to learn computer theory and practice. It wouldn’t do any good for us to find the Brain if none of us are able to use it. Well, I learned enough to be able to operate, program and service any computer in existence, and train assistants. During my last year at the University, I had a part-time paid job programming the big positron-neutrino-photon computer in the astrophysics department. When I graduated, I was offered a position as instructor in positronic computer theory.”</p>
			<p>“You never mentioned that in your letters, son,” his father said.</p>
			<p>“It was too late for any letter except one that would come on the same ship I did. Beside, it wasn’t very important.”</p>
			<p>“I think it was.” There was a catch in old Professor Kellton’s voice. “One of my boys, from the Academy, offered a place on the faculty of the University of Montevideo, on Terra!” He poured himself a second drink, something he almost never did.</p>
			<p>“Conn means it wasn’t important because it didn’t have anything to do with the Brain,” Fawzi explained and then looked at Conn expectantly.</p>
			<p>All right; now he’d tell them. “I went over all the records of the Third Fleet-Army Force’s occupation of Poictesme that are open to the public. On one pretext or another, I got permission to examine the non-classified files that aren’t open to public examination. I even got a few peeps at some of the stuff that’s still classified secret. I have maps and plans of all the installations that were built on this planet⁠—literally thousands of them, many still undiscovered. Why, we haven’t more than scratched the surface of what the Federation left behind here. For instance, all the important installations exist in duplicate, some even in triplicate, as a precaution against Alliance space attack.”</p>
			<p>“Space attack!” Colonel Zareff was indignant. “There never was a time when the Alliance could have taken the offensive against Poictesme, even if an offensive outside our own space-area had been part of our policy. We just didn’t have the ships. It took over a year to move a million and a half troops from Ashmodai to Marduk, and the fleet that was based on Amaterasu was blasted out of existence in the spaceports and in orbit. Hell, at the time of the surrender, we didn’t have⁠—”</p>
			<p>“They weren’t taking chances on that, Colonel. But the point I want to make is that with everything I did find, I never found, in any official record, a single word about the giant computer we call the Third Fleet-Army Force Brain.”</p>
			<p>For a time, the only sound in the room was the tiny insectile humming of the electric clock on the wall. Then Professor Kellton set his glass on the table, and it sounded like a hammer-blow.</p>
			<p>“Nothing, Conn?” Kurt Fawzi was incredulous and, for the first time, frightened. The others were exchanging uneasy glances. “But you must have! A thing like that⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Of course it would be one of the closest secrets during the war,” somebody else said. “But in forty years, you’d expect <em>something</em> to leak out.”</p>
			<p>“Why, <em>during</em> the war, it was all through the Third Force. Even the Alliance knew about it; that’s how Klem heard of it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, Conn couldn’t just walk into the secret files and read whatever he wanted to. Just because he couldn’t find anything⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Don’t tell <em>me</em> about security!” Klem Zareff snorted. “Certainly they still have it classified; staff-brass’d rather lose an eye than declassify anything. If you’d seen the lengths our staff went to⁠—hell, we lost battles because the staff wouldn’t release information the troops in the field needed. I remember once⁠—”</p>
			<p>“But there <em>was</em> a Brain,” Judge Ledue was saying, to reassure himself and draw agreement from the others. “It was capable of combining data, and scanning and evaluating all its positronic memories, and forming association patterns, and reasoning with absolute perfection. It was more than a positronic brain⁠—it was a positronic super-mind.”</p>
			<p>“We’d have won the war, except for the Brain. We had ninety systems, a hundred and thirty inhabited planets, a hundred billion people⁠—and we were on the defensive in our own space-area! Every move we made was known and anticipated by the Federation. How could they have done that without something like the Brain?”</p>
			<p>“Conn, from what you learned of computers, how large a volume of space would you say the Brain would have to occupy?” Professor Kellton asked.</p>
			<p>Professor Kellton was the most unworldly of the lot, yet he was asking the most practical question.</p>
			<p>“Well, the astrophysics computer I worked with at the University occupies a total of about one million cubic feet,” Conn began. This was his chance; they’d take anything he told them about computers as gospel. “It was only designed to handle problems in astrophysics. The Brain, being built for space war, would have to handle any such problem. And if half the stories about the Brain are anywhere near true, it handled any other problem⁠—mathematical, scientific, political, economic, strategic, psychological, even philosophical and ethical. Well, I’d say that a hundred million cubic feet would be the smallest even conceivable.”</p>
			<p>They all nodded seriously. They were willing to accept that⁠—or anything else, except one thing.</p>
			<p>“Lot of places on this planet where a thing that size could be hidden,” Tom Brangwyn said, undismayed. “A planet’s a mighty big place.”</p>
			<p>“It could be under water, in one of the seas,” Piet Dawes, the banker, suggested. “An underwater dome city wouldn’t be any harder to build than a dome city on a poison-atmosphere planet like Tubal-Cain.”</p>
			<p>“It might even be on Tubal-Cain,” a melon-planter said. “Or Hiawatha, or even one of the Beta or Gamma planets. The Third Force was occupying the whole Trisystem, you know.” He thought for a moment. “If I’d been in charge, I’d have put it on one of the moons of Pantagruel.”</p>
			<p>“But that’s clear out in the Alpha System,” Judge Ledue objected. “We don’t have a spaceship on the planet, certainly nothing with a hyperdrive engine. And it would take a lifetime to get out to the Gamma System and back on reaction drive.”</p>
			<p>Conn put his empty brandy glass on the table and sat erect. A new thought had occurred to him, chasing out of his mind all the worries and fears he had brought with him all the way from Terra.</p>
			<p>“Then we’ll have to build a ship,” he said calmly. “I know, when the Federation evacuated Poictesme, they took every hyperdrive ship with them. But they had plenty of shipyards and spaceports on this planet, and I have maps showing the location of all of them, and barely a third of them have been discovered so far. I’m sure we can find enough hulks, and enough hyperfield generator parts, to assemble a ship or two, and I know we’ll find the same or better on some of the other planets.</p>
			<p>“And here’s another thing,” he added. “When we start looking into some of the dome-city plants on Tubal-Cain and Hiawatha and Moruna and Koshchei, we may find the plant or plants where the components for the Brain were fabricated, and if we do, we may find records of where they were shipped, and that’ll be it.”</p>
			<p>“You’re right!” Professor Kellton cried, quivering with excitement. “We’ve been hunting at random for the Brain, so it would only be an accident if we found it. We’ll have to do this systematically, and with Conn to help us⁠—Conn, why not build a computer? I don’t mean another Brain; I mean a computer to help us find the Brain.”</p>
			<p>“We can, but we may not even need to build one. When we get out to the industrial planets, we may find one ready except for perhaps some minor alterations.”</p>
			<p>“But how are we going to finance all this?” Klem Zareff demanded querulously. “We’re poorer than snakes, and even one hyperdrive ship’s going to cost like Gehenna.”</p>
			<p>“I’ve been thinking about that, Klem,” Fawzi said. “If we can find material at these shipyards Conn knows about, most of our expense will be labor. Well, haven’t we ten workmen competing for every job? They don’t really need money, only the things money can buy. We can raise food on the farms and provide whatever else they need out of Federation supplies.”</p>
			<p>“Sure. As soon as it gets around that we’re really trying to do something about this, everybody’ll want in on it,” Tom Brangwyn predicted.</p>
			<p>“And I have no doubt that the Planetary Government at Storisende will give us assistance, once we show that this is a practical and productive enterprise,” Judge Ledue put in. “I have some slight influence with the President and⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I’m not too sure we want the Government getting into this,” Kurt Fawzi replied. “Give them half a chance and that gang at Storisende’ll squeeze us right out.”</p>
			<p>“We can handle this ourselves,” Brangwyn agreed. “And when we get some kind of a ship and get out to the other two systems, or even just to Tubal-Cain or Hiawatha, first thing you know, we’ll <em>be</em> the Planetary Government.”</p>
			<p>“Well, now, Tom,” Fawzi began piously, “the Brain is too big a thing for a few of us to try to monopolize; it’ll be for all Poictesme. Of course, it’s only proper that we, who are making the effort to locate it, should have the direction of that effort.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>While Fawzi was talking, Rodney Maxwell went to the table, rummaged his pistol out of the pile and buckled it on. The mayor stopped short.</p>
			<p>“You leaving us, Rod?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, it’s getting late. Conn and I are going for a little walk; we’ll be at Senta’s in half an hour. The fresh air will do both of us good and we have a lot to talk about. After all, we haven’t seen each other for over five years.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They were silent, however, until they were away from the Airport Building and walking along High Garden Terrace in the direction of the Mall. Conn was glad; his own thoughts were weighing too heavily within him: I didn’t do it. I was going to do it; every minute, I was going to do it, and I didn’t, and now it’s too late.</p>
			<p>“That was quite a talk you gave them, son,” his father said. “They believed every word of it. A couple of times, I even caught myself starting to believe it.”</p>
			<p>Conn stopped short. His father stopped beside him and stood looking at him.</p>
			<p>“Why didn’t you tell them the truth?” Rodney Maxwell asked.</p>
			<p>The question angered Conn. It was what he had been asking himself.</p>
			<p>“Why didn’t I just grab a couple of pistols off the table and shoot the lot of them?” he retorted. “It would have killed them quicker and wouldn’t have hurt as much.”</p>
			<p>His father took the cigar from his mouth and inspected the tip of it. “The truth must be pretty bad then. There is no Brain. Is that it, son?”</p>
			<p>“There never was one. I’m not saying that only because I know it would be impossible to build such a computer. I’m telling you what the one man in the Galaxy who ought to know told me⁠—the man who commanded the Third Force during the War.”</p>
			<p>“Foxx Travis! I didn’t know he was still alive. You actually talked to him?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. He’s on Luna, keeping himself alive at low gravity. It took me a couple of years, and I was afraid he’d die before I got to him, but I finally managed to see him.”</p>
			<p>“What did he tell you?”</p>
			<p>“That no such thing as the Brain ever existed.” They started walking again, more slowly, toward the far edge of the terrace, with the sky red and orange in front of them. “The story was all through the Third Force, but it was just one of those wild tales that get started, nobody knows how, among troops. The High Command never denied or even discouraged it. It helped morale, and letting it leak to the enemy was good psychological warfare.”</p>
			<p>“Klem Zareff says that everybody in the Alliance army heard of the Brain,” his father said. “That was why he came here in the first place.” He puffed thoughtfully on his cigar. “You said a computer like the Brain would be an impossibility. Why? Wouldn’t it be just another computer, only a lot bigger and a lot smarter?”</p>
			<p>“Dad, computermen don’t like to hear computers called smart,” Conn said. “They aren’t. The people who build them are smart; a computer only knows what’s fed to it. They can hold more information in their banks than a man can in his memory, they can combine it faster, they don’t get tired or absentminded. But they can’t imagine, they can’t create, and they can’t do anything a human brain can’t.”</p>
			<p>“You know, I’d wondered about just that,” said his father. “And none of the histories of the War even as much as mentioned the Brain. And I couldn’t see why, after the War, they didn’t build dozens of them to handle all these Galactic political and economic problems that nobody seems able to solve. A thing like the Brain wouldn’t only be useful for war; the people here aren’t trying to find it for war purposes.”</p>
			<p>“You didn’t mention any of these doubts to the others, did you?”</p>
			<p>“They were just doubts. You knew for sure, and you couldn’t tell them.”</p>
			<p>“I’d come home intending to⁠—tell them there was no Brain, tell them to stop wasting their time hunting for it and start trying to figure out the answers themselves. But I couldn’t. They don’t believe in the Brain as a tool, to use; it’s a machine god that they can bring all their troubles to. You can’t take a thing like that away from people without giving them something better.”</p>
			<p>“I noticed you suggested building a spaceship and agreed with the professor about building a computer. What was your idea? To take their minds off hunting for the Brain and keep them busy?”</p>
			<p>Conn shook his head. “I’m serious about the ship⁠—ships. You and Colonel Zareff gave me that idea.”</p>
			<p>His father looked at him in surprise. “I never said a word in there, and Klem didn’t even once mention⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Not in Kurt’s office; before we went up from the docks. There was Klem, moaning about a good year for melons as though it were a plague, and you selling arms and ammunition by the ton. Why, on Terra or Baldur or Uller, a glass of our brandy brings more than these freighter-captains give us for a cask, and what do you think a colonist on Agramma, or Sekht, or Hachiman, who has to fight for his life against savages and wild animals, would pay for one of those rifles and a thousand rounds of ammunition?”</p>
			<p>His father objected. “We can’t base the whole economy of a planet on brandy. Only about ten percent of the arable land on Poictesme will grow wine-melons. And if we start exporting Federation salvage the way you talk of, we’ll be selling pieces instead of job lots. We’ll net more, but⁠—”</p>
			<p>“That’s just to get us started. The ships will be used, after that, to get to Tubal-Cain and Hiawatha and the planets of the Beta and Gamma Systems. What I want to see is the mines and factories reopened, people employed, wealth being produced.”</p>
			<p>“And where’ll we sell what we produce? Remember, the mines closed down because there was no more market.”</p>
			<p>“No more interstellar market, that’s true. But there are a hundred and fifty million people on Poictesme. That’s a big enough market and a big enough labor force to exploit the wealth of the Gartner Trisystem. We can have prosperity for everybody on our own resources. Just what do we need that we have to get from outside now?”</p>
			<p>His father stopped again and sat down on the edge of a fountain⁠—the same one, possibly, from which Conn had seen dust blowing as the airship had been coming in.</p>
			<p>“Conn, that’s a dangerous idea. That was what brought on the System States War. The Alliance planets took themselves outside the Federation economic orbit and the Federation crushed them.”</p>
			<p>Conn swore impatiently. “You’ve been listening to old Klem Zareff ranting about the Lost Cause and the greedy Terran robber barons holding the Galaxy in economic serfdom while they piled up profits. The Federation didn’t fight that war for profits; there weren’t any profits to fight for. They fought it because if the System States had won, half of them would be at war among themselves now. Make no mistake about it, politically I’m all for the Federation. But economically, I want to see our people exploiting their own resources for themselves, instead of grieving about lost interstellar trade, and bewailing bumper crops, and searching for a mythical robot god.”</p>
			<p>“You think, if you can get something like that started, that they’ll forget about the Brain?” his father asked skeptically.</p>
			<p>“That crowd up in Kurt Fawzi’s office? Niflheim, no! They’ll go on hunting for the Brain as long as they live, and every day they’ll be expecting to find it tomorrow. That’ll keep them happy. But they’re all old men. The ones I’m interested in are the boys of Charley’s age. I’m going to give them too many real things to do⁠—building ships, exploring the rest of the Trisystem, opening mines and factories, producing wealth⁠—for them to get caught in that empty old dream.”</p>
			<p>He looked down at the dusty fountain on which his father sat. “That ghost-dream haunts this graveyard. I want to give them living dreams that they can make come true.”</p>
			<p>Conn’s father sat in silence for a while, his cigar smoke red in the sunset. “If you can do all that, Conn.⁠ ⁠… You know, I believe you can. I’m with you, as far as I can help, and we’ll have a talk with Charley. He’s a good boy, Conn, and he has a lot of influence among the other youngsters.” He looked at his watch. “We’d better be getting along. You don’t want to be late for your own coming-home party.”</p>
			<p>Rodney Maxwell slid off the edge of the fountain to his feet, hitching at the gunbelt under his coat. Have to dig out his own gun and start wearing it, Conn thought. A man simply didn’t go around in public without a gun in Litchfield. It wasn’t decent. And he’d be spending a lot of time out in the brush, where he’d really need one.</p>
			<p>First thing in the morning, he’d unpack that trunk and go over all those maps. There were half a dozen spaceports and maintenance shops and shipyards within a half-day by airboat, none of which had been looted. He’d look them all over; that would take a couple of weeks. Pick the best shipyard and concentrate on it. Kurt Fawzi’d be the man to recruit labor. Professor Kellton was a scholar, not a scientist. He didn’t know beans about hyperdrive engines, but he knew how to do library research.</p>
			<p>They came to the edge of High Garden Terrace at the escalator, long motionless, its moving parts rusted fast, that led down to the Mall, and at the bottom of it was Senta’s, the tables under the open sky.</p>
			<p>A crowd was already gathering. There was Tom Brangwyn, and there was Kurt Fawzi and his wife, and Lynne. And there was Senta herself, fat and dumpy, in one of her preposterous red-and-purple dresses, bustling about, bubbling happily one moment and screaming invective at some laggard waiter the next.</p>
			<p>The dinner, Conn knew, would be the best he had eaten in five years, and afterward they would sit in the dim glow of Beta Gartner, sipping coffee and liqueurs, smoking and talking and visiting back and forth from one table to another, as they always did in the evenings at Senta’s. Another bit from Eirrarsson’s poem came back to him:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>We sit in the twilight, the shadows among,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And we talk of the happy days when we were brave and young.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>That was for the old ones, for Colonel Zareff and Judge Ledue and Dolf Kellton, maybe even for Tom Brangwyn and Franz Veltrin and for his father. But his brother Charley and the boys of his generation would have a future to talk about. And so would he, and Lynne Fawzi.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">He Walked Around the Horses</h2>
			<blockquote>
				<p>In November 1809, an Englishman named Benjamin Bathurst vanished, inexplicably and utterly.</p>
				<p>He was en route to Hamburg from Vienna, where he had been serving as his government’s envoy to the court of what Napoleon had left of the Austrian Empire. At an inn in Perleburg, in Prussia, while examining a change of horses for his coach, he casually stepped out of sight of his secretary and his valet. He was not seen to leave the inn yard. He was not seen again, ever.</p>
				<p>At least, not in this continuum.⁠ ⁠…</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Your Excellency:</p>
				<p>A circumstance has come to the notice of this Ministry, the significance of which I am at a loss to define, but, since it appears to involve matters of State, both here and abroad, I am convinced that it is of sufficient importance to be brought to your personal attention. Frankly, I am unwilling to take any further action in the matter without your advice.</p>
				<p>Briefly, the situation is this: We are holding, here at the Ministry of Police, a person giving his name as Benjamin Bathurst, who claims to be a British diplomat. This person was taken into custody by the police at Perleburg yesterday, as a result of a disturbance at an inn there; he is being detained on technical charges of causing disorder in a public place, and of being a suspicious person. When arrested, he had in his possession a dispatch case, containing a number of papers; these are of such an extraordinary nature that the local authorities declined to assume any responsibility beyond having the man sent here to Berlin.</p>
				<p>After interviewing this person and examining his papers, I am, I must confess, in much the same position. This is not, I am convinced, any ordinary police matter; there is something very strange and disturbing here. The man’s statements, taken alone, are so incredible as to justify the assumption that he is mad. I cannot, however, adopt this theory, in view of his demeanor, which is that of a man of perfect rationality, and because of the existence of these papers. The whole thing is mad; incomprehensible!</p>
				<p>The papers in question accompany, along with copies of the various statements taken at Perleburg, a personal letter to me from my nephew, Lieutenant Rudolf von Tarlburg. This last is deserving of your particular attention; Lieutenant von Tarlburg is a very levelheaded young officer, not at all inclined to be fanciful or imaginative. It would take a good deal to affect him as he describes.</p>
				<p>The man calling himself Benjamin Bathurst is now lodged in an apartment here at the Ministry; he is being treated with every consideration, and, except for freedom of movement, accorded every privilege.</p>

					<p>(Report of Traugott Zeller, <span xml:lang="de">Oberwachtmeister, Staatspolizei</span>, made at Perleburg, <time datetime="1809-11-25">25 November, 1809</time>.)</p>
				</header>
				<p>At about ten minutes past two of the afternoon of Saturday, 25 November, while I was at the police station, there entered a man known to me as Franz Bauer, an inn servant employed by Christian Hauck, at the sign of the Sword &amp; Scepter, here in Perleburg. This man Franz Bauer made complaint to <i xml:lang="de">Staatspolizeikapitan</i> Ernst Hartenstein, saying that there was a madman making trouble at the inn where he, Franz Bauer, worked. I was, therefore, directed, by <i xml:lang="de">Staatspolizeikapitan</i> Hartenstein, to go to the Sword &amp; Scepter Inn, there to act at discretion to maintain the peace.</p>
				<p>Arriving at the inn in company with the said Franz Bauer, I found a considerable crowd of people in the common room, and, in the midst of them, the innkeeper, Christian Hauck, in altercation with a stranger. This stranger was a gentlemanly-appearing person, dressed in traveling clothes, who had under his arm a small leather dispatch case. As I entered, I could hear him, speaking in German with a strong English accent, abusing the innkeeper, the said Christian Hauck, and accusing him of having drugged his, the stranger’s, wine, and of having stolen his, the stranger’s, coach-and-four, and of having abducted his, the stranger’s, secretary and servants. This the said Christian Hauck was loudly denying, and the other people in the inn were taking the innkeeper’s part, and mocking the stranger for a madman.</p>
				<p>On entering, I commanded everyone to be silent, in the king’s name, and then, as he appeared to be the complaining party of the dispute, I required the foreign gentleman to state to me what was the trouble. He then repeated his accusations against the innkeeper, Hauck, saying that Hauck, or, rather, another man who resembled Hauck and who had claimed to be the innkeeper, had drugged his wine and stolen his coach and made off with his secretary and his servants. At this point, the innkeeper and the bystanders all began shouting denials and contradictions, so that I had to pound on a table with my truncheon to command silence.</p>
				<p>I then required the innkeeper, Christian Hauck, to answer the charges which the stranger had made; this he did with a complete denial of all of them, saying that the stranger had had no wine in his inn, and that he had not been inside the inn until a few minutes before, when he had burst in shouting accusations, and that there had been no secretary, and no valet, and no coachman, and no coach-and-four, at the inn, and that the gentleman was raving mad. To all this, he called the people who were in the common room to witness.</p>
				<p>I then required the stranger to account for himself. He said that his name was Benjamin Bathurst, and that he was a British diplomat, returning to England from Vienna. To prove this, he produced from his dispatch case sundry papers. One of these was a letter of safe-conduct, issued by the Prussian Chancellery, in which he was named and described as Benjamin Bathurst. The other papers were English, all bearing seals, and appearing to be official documents.</p>
				<p>Accordingly, I requested him to accompany me to the police station, and also the innkeeper, and three men whom the innkeeper wanted to bring as witnesses.</p>

					<p>(Statement of the self-so-called Benjamin Bathurst, taken at the police station at Perleburg, <time datetime="1809-11-25">25 November, 1809</time>.)</p>
				</header>
				<p>My name is Benjamin Bathurst, and I am Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the government of His Britannic Majesty to the court of His Majesty Franz <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, Emperor of Austria, or, at least, I was until the events following the Austrian surrender made necessary my return to London. I left Vienna on the morning of Monday, the 20th, to go to Hamburg to take ship home; I was traveling in my own coach-and-four, with my secretary, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Bertram Jardine, and my valet, William Small, both British subjects, and a coachman, Josef Bidek, an Austrian subject, whom I had hired for the trip. Because of the presence of French troops, whom I was anxious to avoid, I was forced to make a detour west as far as Salzburg before turning north toward Magdeburg, where I crossed the Elbe. I was unable to get a change of horses for my coach after leaving Gera, until I reached Perleburg, where I stopped at the Sword &amp; Scepter Inn.</p>
				<p>Arriving there, I left my coach in the inn yard, and I and my secretary, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Jardine, went into the inn. A man, not this fellow here, but another rogue, with more beard and less paunch, and more shabbily dressed, but as like him as though he were his brother, represented himself as the innkeeper, and I dealt with him for a change of horses, and ordered a bottle of wine for myself and my secretary, and also a pot of beer apiece for my valet and the coachman, to be taken outside to them. Then Jardine and I sat down to our wine, at a table in the common room, until the man who claimed to be the innkeeper came back and told us that the fresh horses were harnessed to the coach and ready to go. Then we went outside again.</p>
				<p>I looked at the two horses on the off side, and then walked around in front of the team to look at the two nigh-side horses, and as I did I felt giddy, as though I were about to fall, and everything went black before my eyes. I thought I was having a fainting spell, something I am not at all subject to, and I put out my hand to grasp the hitching bar, but could not find it. I am sure, now, that I was unconscious for some time, because when my head cleared, the coach and horses were gone, and in their place was a big farm wagon, jacked up in front, with the right front wheel off, and two peasants were greasing the detached wheel.</p>
				<p>I looked at them for a moment, unable to credit my eyes, and then I spoke to them in German, saying, “Where the devil’s my coach-and-four?”</p>
				<p>They both straightened, startled: the one who was holding the wheel almost dropped it.</p>
				<p>“Pardon, excellency,” he said, “there’s been no coach-and-four here, all the time we’ve been here.”</p>
				<p>“Yes,” said his mate, “and we’ve been here since just after noon.”</p>
				<p>I did not attempt to argue with them. It occurred to me⁠—and it is still my opinion⁠—that I was the victim of some plot; that my wine had been drugged, that I had been unconscious for some time, during which my coach had been removed and this wagon substituted for it, and that these peasants had been put to work on it and instructed what to say if questioned. If my arrival at the inn had been anticipated, and everything put in readiness, the whole business would not have taken ten minutes.</p>
				<p>I therefore entered the inn, determined to have it out with this rascally innkeeper, but when I returned to the common room, he was nowhere to be seen, and this other fellow, who has given his name as Christian Hauck, claimed to be the innkeeper and denied knowledge of any of the things I have just stated. Furthermore, there were four cavalrymen, Uhlans, drinking beer and playing cards at the table where Jardine and I had had our wine, and they claimed to have been there for several hours.</p>
				<p>I have no idea why such an elaborate prank, involving the participation of many people, should be played on me, except at the instigation of the French. In that case, I cannot understand why Prussian soldiers should lend themselves to it.</p>

				<p>May it please your honor, my name is Christian Hauck, and I keep an inn at the sign of the Sword &amp; Scepter, and have these past fifteen years, and my father, and his father, before me, for the past fifty years, and never has there been a complaint like this against my inn. Your honor, it is a hard thing for a man who keeps a decent house, and pays his taxes, and obeys the laws, to be accused of crimes of this sort.</p>
				<p>I know nothing of this gentleman, nor of his coach, nor his secretary, nor his servants; I never set eyes on him before he came bursting into the inn from the yard, shouting and raving like a madman, and crying out, “Where the devil’s that rogue of an innkeeper?”</p>
				<p>I said to him, “I am the innkeeper; what cause have you to call me a rogue, sir?”</p>
				<p>The stranger replied:</p>
				<p>“You’re not the innkeeper I did business with a few minutes ago, and he’s the rascal I want to see. I want to know what the devil’s been done with my coach, and what’s happened to my secretary and my servants.”</p>
				<p>I tried to tell him that I knew nothing of what he was talking about, but he would not listen, and gave me the lie, saying that he had been drugged and robbed, and his people kidnaped. He even had the impudence to claim that he and his secretary had been sitting at a table in that room, drinking wine, not fifteen minutes before, when there had been four noncommissioned officers of the Third Uhlans at that table since noon. Everybody in the room spoke up for me, but he would not listen, and was shouting that we were all robbers, and kidnapers, and French spies, and I don’t know what all, when the police came.</p>
				<p>Your honor, the man is mad. What I have told you about this is the truth, and all that I know about this business, so help me God.</p>

				<p>May it please your honor, my name is Franz Bauer, and I am a servant at the Sword &amp; Scepter Inn, kept by Christian Hauck.</p>
				<p>This afternoon, when I went into the inn yard to empty a bucket of slops on the dung heap by the stables, I heard voices and turned around, to see this gentleman speaking to Wilhelm Beick and Fritz Herzer, who were greasing their wagon in the yard. He had not been in the yard when I had turned away to empty the bucket, and I thought that he must have come in from the street. This gentleman was asking Beick and Herzer where was his coach, and when they told him they didn’t know, he turned and ran into the inn.</p>
				<p>Of my own knowledge, the man had not been inside the inn before then, nor had there been any coach, or any of the people he spoke of, at the inn, and none of the things he spoke of happened there, for otherwise I would know, since I was at the inn all day.</p>
				<p>When I went back inside, I found him in the common room shouting at my master, and claiming that he had been drugged and robbed. I saw that he was mad and was afraid that he would do some mischief, so I went for the police.</p>

				<p>May it please your honor, my name is Wilhelm Beick, and I am a tenant on the estate of the Baron von Hentig. On this day, I and Fritz Herzer were sent into Perleburg with a load of potatoes and cabbages which the innkeeper at the Sword &amp; Scepter had bought from the estate superintendent. After we had unloaded them, we decided to grease our wagon, which was very dry, before going back, so we unhitched and began working on it. We took about two hours, starting just after we had eaten lunch, and in all that time, there was no coach-and-four in the inn yard. We were just finishing when this gentleman spoke to us, demanding to know where his coach was. We told him that there had been no coach in the yard all the time we had been there, so he turned around and ran into the inn. At the time, I thought that he had come out of the inn before speaking to us, for I know that he could not have come in from the street. Now I do not know where he came from, but I know that I never saw him before that moment.</p>

					<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">25 November, 1809</p>
				</header>
				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Your Excellency:</p>
				<p>The accompanying copies of statements taken this day will explain how the prisoner, the self-so-called Benjamin Bathurst, came into my custody. I have charged him with causing disorder and being a suspicious person, to hold him until more can be learned about him. However, as he represents himself to be a British diplomat, I am unwilling to assume any further responsibility, and am having him sent to your excellency, in Berlin.</p>
				<p>In the first place, your excellency, I have the strongest doubts of the man’s story. The statement which he made before me, and signed, is bad enough, with a coach-and-four turning into a farm wagon, like Cinderella’s coach into a pumpkin, and three people vanishing as though swallowed by the earth. But all this is perfectly reasonable and credible, beside the things he said to me, of which no record was made.</p>
				<p>Your excellency will have noticed, in his statement, certain allusions to the Austrian surrender, and to French troops in Austria. After his statement had been taken down, I noticed these allusions, and I inquired, what surrender, and what were French troops doing in Austria. The man looked at me in a pitying manner, and said:</p>
				<p>“News seems to travel slowly, hereabouts; peace was concluded at Vienna on the 14th of last month. And as for what French troops are doing in Austria, they’re doing the same things Bonaparte’s brigands are doing everywhere in Europe.”</p>
				<p>“And who is Bonaparte?” I asked.</p>
				<p>He stared at me as though I had asked him, “Who is the Lord Jehovah?” Then, after a moment, a look of comprehension came into his face.</p>
				<p>“So, you Prussians concede him the title of Emperor, and refer to him as Napoleon,” he said. “Well, I can assure you that His Britannic Majesty’s government haven’t done so, and never will; not so long as one Englishman has a finger left to pull a trigger. General Bonaparte is a usurper; His Britannic Majesty’s government do not recognize any sovereignty in France except the House of Bourbon.” This he said very sternly, as though rebuking me.</p>
				<p>It took me a moment or so to digest that, and to appreciate all its implications. Why, this fellow evidently believed, as a matter of fact, that the French Monarchy had been overthrown by some military adventurer named Bonaparte, who was calling himself the Emperor Napoleon, and who had made war on Austria and forced a surrender. I made no attempt to argue with him⁠—one wastes time arguing with madmen⁠—but if this man could believe that, the transformation of a coach-and-four into a cabbage wagon was a small matter indeed. So, to humor him, I asked him if he thought General Bonaparte’s agents were responsible for his trouble at the inn.</p>
				<p>“Certainly,” he replied. “The chances are they didn’t know me to see me, and took Jardine for the minister, and me for the secretary, so they made off with poor Jardine. I wonder, though, that they left me my dispatch case. And that reminds me; I’ll want that back. Diplomatic papers, you know.”</p>
				<p>I told him, very seriously, that we would have to check his credentials. I promised him I would make every effort to locate his secretary and his servants and his coach, took a complete description of all of them, and persuaded him to go into an upstairs room, where I kept him under guard. I did start inquiries, calling in all my informers and spies, but, as I expected, I could learn nothing. I could not find anybody, even, who had seen him anywhere in Perleburg before he appeared at the Sword &amp; Scepter, and that rather surprised me, as somebody should have seen him enter the town, or walk along the street.</p>
				<p>In this connection, let me remind your excellency of the discrepancy in the statements of the servant, Franz Bauer, and of the two peasants. The former is certain the man entered the inn yard from the street; the latter are just as positive that he did not. Your excellency, I do not like such puzzles, for I am sure that all three were telling the truth to the best of their knowledge. They are ignorant common folk, I admit, but they should know what they did or did not see.</p>
				<p>After I got the prisoner into safekeeping, I fell to examining his papers, and I can assure your excellency that they gave me a shock. I had paid little heed to his ravings about the King of France being dethroned, or about this General Bonaparte who called himself the Emperor Napoleon, but I found all these things mentioned in his papers and dispatches, which had every appearance of being official documents. There was repeated mention of the taking, by the French, of Vienna, last May, and of the capitulation of the Austrian Emperor to this General Bonaparte, and of battles being fought all over Europe, and I don’t know what other fantastic things. Your excellency, I have heard of all sorts of madmen⁠—one believing himself to be the Archangel Gabriel, or Mohammed, or a werewolf, and another convinced that his bones are made of glass, or that he is pursued and tormented by devils⁠—but so help me God, this is the first time I have heard of a madman who had documentary proof for his delusions! Does your excellency wonder, then, that I want no part of this business?</p>
				<p>But the matter of his credentials was even worse. He had papers, sealed with the seal of the British Foreign Office, and to every appearance genuine⁠—but they were signed, as Foreign Minister, by one George Canning, and all the world knows that Lord Castlereagh has been Foreign Minister these last five years. And to cap it all, he had a safe-conduct, sealed with the seal of the Prussian Chancellery⁠—the very seal, for I compared it, under a strong magnifying glass, with one that I knew to be genuine, and they were identical!⁠—and yet, this letter was signed, as Chancellor, not by Count von Berchtenwald, but by Baron Stein, the Minister of Agriculture, and the signature, as far as I could see, appeared to be genuine! This is too much for me, your excellency; I must ask to be excused from dealing with this matter, before I become as mad as my prisoner!</p>
				<p>I made arrangements, accordingly, with Colonel Keitel, of the Third Uhlans, to furnish an officer to escort this man into Berlin. The coach in which they come belongs to this police station, and the driver is one of my men. He should be furnished expense money to get back to Perleburg. The guard is a corporal of Uhlans, the orderly of the officer. He will stay with the <i xml:lang="de">Herr Oberleutnant</i>, and both of them will return here at their own convenience and expense.</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Dear Uncle Eugen;</p>
				<p>This is in no sense a formal report; I made that at the Ministry, when I turned the Englishman and his papers over to one of your officers⁠—a fellow with red hair and a face like a bulldog. But there are a few things which you should be told, which wouldn’t look well in an official report, to let you know just what sort of a rare fish has got into your net.</p>
				<p>I had just come in from drilling my platoon, yesterday, when Colonel Keitel’s orderly told me that the colonel wanted to see me in his quarters. I found the old fellow in undress in his sitting room, smoking his big pipe.</p>
				<p>“Come in, lieutenant; come in and sit down, my boy!” he greeted me, in that bluff, hearty manner which he always adopts with his junior officers when he has some particularly nasty job to be done. “How would you like to take a little trip in to Berlin? I have an errand, which won’t take half an hour, and you can stay as long as you like, just so you’re back by Thursday, when your turn comes up for road patrol.”</p>
				<p>Well, I thought, this is the bait. I waited to see what the hook would look like, saying that it was entirely agreeable with me, and asking what his errand was.</p>
				<p>“Well, it isn’t for myself, Tarlburg,” he said. “It’s for this fellow Hartenstein, the <i xml:lang="de">Staatspolizeikapitan</i> here. He has something he wants done at the Ministry of Police, and I thought of you because I’ve heard you’re related to the Baron von Krutz. You are, aren’t you?” he asked, just as though he didn’t know all about who all his officers are related to.</p>
				<p>“That’s right, colonel; the baron is my uncle,” I said. “What does Hartenstein want done?”</p>
				<p>“Why, he has a prisoner whom he wants taken to Berlin and turned over at the Ministry. All you have to do is to take him in, in a coach, and see he doesn’t escape on the way, and get a receipt for him, and for some papers. This is a very important prisoner; I don’t think Hartenstein has anybody he can trust to handle him. The prisoner claims to be some sort of a British diplomat, and for all Hartenstein knows, maybe he is. Also, he is a madman.”</p>
				<p>“A madman?” I echoed.</p>
				<p>“Yes, just so. At least, that’s what Hartenstein told me. I wanted to know what sort of a madman⁠—there are various kinds of madmen, all of whom must be handled differently⁠—but all Hartenstein would tell me was that he had unrealistic beliefs about the state of affairs in Europe.”</p>
				<p>“Ha! What diplomat hasn’t?” I asked.</p>
				<p>Old Keitel gave a laugh, somewhere between the bark of a dog and the croaking of a raven.</p>
				<p>“Yes, exactly! The unrealistic beliefs of diplomats are what soldiers die of,” he said. “I said as much to Hartenstein, but he wouldn’t tell me anything more. He seemed to regret having said even that much. He looked like a man who’s seen a particularly terrifying ghost.” The old man puffed hard at his famous pipe for a while, blowing smoke through his mustache. “Rudi, Hartenstein has pulled a hot potato out of the ashes, this time, and he wants to toss it to your uncle, before he burns his fingers. I think that’s one reason why he got me to furnish an escort for his Englishman. Now, look; you must take this unrealistic diplomat, or this undiplomatic madman, or whatever in blazes he is, in to Berlin. And understand this.” He pointed his pipe at me as though it were a pistol. “Your orders are to take him there and turn him over at the Ministry of Police. Nothing has been said about whether you turn him over alive, or dead, or half one and half the other. I know nothing about this business, and want to know nothing; if Hartenstein wants us to play gaol warders for him, then he must be satisfied with our way of doing it!”</p>
				<p>Well, to cut short the story, I looked at the coach Hartenstein had placed at my disposal, and I decided to chain the left door shut on the outside, so that it couldn’t be opened from within. Then, I would put my prisoner on my left, so that the only way out would be past me. I decided not to carry any weapons which he might be able to snatch from me, so I took off my saber and locked it in the seat box, along with the dispatch case containing the Englishman’s papers. It was cold enough to wear a greatcoat in comfort, so I wore mine, and in the right side pocket, where my prisoner couldn’t reach, I put a little leaded bludgeon, and also a brace of pocket pistols. Hartenstein was going to furnish me a guard as well as a driver, but I said that I would take a servant, who could act as guard. The servant, of course, was my orderly, old Johann; I gave him my double hunting gun to carry, with a big charge of boar shot in one barrel and an ounce ball in the other.</p>
				<p>In addition, I armed myself with a big bottle of cognac. I thought that if I could shoot my prisoner often enough with that, he would give me no trouble.</p>
				<p>As it happened, he didn’t, and none of my precautions⁠—except the cognac⁠—were needed. The man didn’t look like a lunatic to me. He was a rather stout gentleman, of past middle age, with a ruddy complexion and an intelligent face. The only unusual thing about him was his hat, which was a peculiar contraption, looking like a pot. I put him in the carriage, and then offered him a drink out of my bottle, taking one about half as big myself. He smacked his lips over it and said, “Well, that’s real brandy; whatever we think of their detestable politics, we can’t criticize the French for their liquor.” Then, he said, “I’m glad they’re sending me in the custody of a military gentleman, instead of a confounded gendarme. Tell me the truth, lieutenant; am I under arrest for anything?”</p>
				<p>“Why,” I said, “Captain Hartenstein should have told you about that. All I know is that I have orders to take you to the Ministry of Police, in Berlin, and not to let you escape on the way. These orders I will carry out; I hope you don’t hold that against me.”</p>
				<p>He assured me that he did not, and we had another drink on it⁠—I made sure, again, that he got twice as much as I did⁠—and then the coachman cracked his whip and we were off for Berlin.</p>
				<p>Now, I thought, I am going to see just what sort of a madman this is, and why Hartenstein is making a State affair out of a squabble at an inn. So I decided to explore his unrealistic beliefs about the state of affairs in Europe.</p>
				<p>After guiding the conversation to where I wanted it, I asked him:</p>
				<p>“What, Herr Bathurst, in your belief, is the real, underlying cause of the present tragic situation in Europe?”</p>
				<p>That, I thought, was safe enough. Name me one year, since the days of Julius Caesar, when the situation in Europe hasn’t been tragic! And it worked, to perfection.</p>
				<p>“In my belief,” says this Englishman, “the whole mess is the result of the victory of the rebellious colonists in North America, and their blasted republic.”</p>
				<p>Well, you can imagine, that gave me a start. All the world knows that the American Patriots lost their war for independence from England; that their army was shattered, that their leaders were either killed or driven into exile. How many times, when I was a little boy, did I not sit up long past my bedtime, when old Baron von Steuben was a guest at Tarlburg-Schloss, listening open-mouthed and wide-eyed to his stories of that gallant lost struggle! How I used to shiver at his tales of the terrible winter camp, or thrill at the battles, or weep as he told how he held the dying Washington in his arms, and listened to his noble last words, at the Battle of Doylestown! And here, this man was telling me that the Patriots had really won, and set up the republic for which they had fought! I had been prepared for some of what Hartenstein had called unrealistic beliefs, but nothing as fantastic as this.</p>
				<p>“I can cut it even finer than that,” Bathurst continued. “It was the defeat of Burgoyne at Saratoga. We made a good bargain when we got Benedict Arnold to turn his coat, but we didn’t do it soon enough. If he hadn’t been on the field that day, Burgoyne would have gone through Gates’ army like a hot knife through butter.”</p>
				<p>But Arnold hadn’t been at Saratoga. I know; I have read much of the American War. Arnold was shot dead on New Year’s Day of 1776, during the storming of Quebec. And Burgoyne had done just as Bathurst had said; he had gone through Gates like a knife, and down the Hudson to join Howe.</p>
				<p>“But, Herr Bathurst,” I asked, “how could that affect the situation in Europe? America is thousands of miles away, across the ocean.”</p>
				<p>“Ideas can cross oceans quicker than armies. When Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span> decided to come to the aid of the Americans, he doomed himself and his regime. A successful resistance to royal authority in America was all the French Republicans needed to inspire them. Of course, we have Louis’s own weakness to blame, too. If he’d given those rascals a whiff of grapeshot, when the mob tried to storm Versailles in 1790, there’d have been no French Revolution.”</p>
				<p>But he had. When Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span> ordered the howitzers turned on the mob at Versailles, and then sent the dragoons to ride down the survivors, the Republican movement had been broken. That had been when Cardinal Talleyrand, who was then merely Bishop of Autun, had came to the fore and become the power that he is today in France; the greatest King’s Minister since Richelieu.</p>
				<p>“And, after that, Louis’s death followed as surely as night after day,” Bathurst was saying. “And because the French had no experience in self-government, their republic was foredoomed. If Bonaparte hadn’t seized power, somebody else would have; when the French murdered their king, they delivered themselves to dictatorship. And a dictator, unsupported by the prestige of royalty, has no choice but to lead his people into foreign war, to keep them from turning upon him.”</p>
				<p>It was like that all the way to Berlin. All these things seem foolish, by daylight, but as I sat in the darkness of that swaying coach, I was almost convinced of the reality of what he told me. I tell you, Uncle Eugen, it was frightening, as though he were giving me a view of Hell. <i xml:lang="de">Gott im Himmel</i>, the things that man talked of! Armies swarming over Europe; sack and massacre, and cities burning; blockades, and starvation; kings deposed, and thrones tumbling like tenpins; battles in which the soldiers of every nation fought, and in which tens of thousands were mowed down like ripe grain; and, over all, the Satanic figure of a little man in a gray coat, who dictated peace to the Austrian Emperor in Schoenbrunn, and carried the Pope away a prisoner to Savona.</p>
				<p>Madman, eh? Unrealistic beliefs, says Hartenstein? Well, give me madmen who drool spittle, and foam at the mouth, and shriek obscene blasphemies. But not this pleasant-seeming gentleman who sat beside me and talked of horrors in a quiet, cultured voice, while he drank my cognac.</p>
				<p>But not all my cognac! If your man at the Ministry⁠—the one with red hair and the bulldog face⁠—tells you that I was drunk when I brought in that Englishman, you had better believe him!</p>

					<p>(From Count von Berchtenwald, to the British Minister.)</p>
					<p epub:type="se:letter.dateline">28 November, 1809</p>
				</header>
				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Honored Sir:</p>
				<p>The accompanying dossier will acquaint you with the problem confronting this Chancellery, without needless repetition on my part. Please to understand that it is not, and never was, any part of the intentions of the government of His Majesty Friedrich Wilhelm <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> to offer any injury or indignity to the government of His Britannic Majesty George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. We would never contemplate holding in arrest the person, or tampering with the papers, of an accredited envoy of your government. However, we have the gravest doubt, to make a considerable understatement, that this person who calls himself Benjamin Bathurst is any such envoy, and we do not think that it would be any service to the government of His Britannic Majesty to allow an impostor to travel about Europe in the guise of a British diplomatic representative. We certainly should not thank the government of His Britannic Majesty for failing to take steps to deal with some person who, in England, might falsely represent himself to be a Prussian diplomat.</p>
				<p>This affair touches us as closely as it does your own government; this man had in his possession a letter of safe-conduct, which you will find in the accompanying dispatch case. It is of the regular form, as issued by this Chancellery, and is sealed with the Chancellery seal, or with a very exact counterfeit of it. However, it has been signed, as Chancellor of Prussia, with a signature indistinguishable from that of the Baron Stein, who is the present Prussian Minister of Agriculture. Baron Stein was shown the signature, with the rest of the letter covered, and without hesitation acknowledged it for his own writing. However, when the letter was uncovered and shown to him, his surprise and horror were such as would require the pen of a Goethe or a Schiller to describe, and he denied categorically ever having seen the document before.</p>
				<p>I have no choice but to believe him. It is impossible to think that a man of Baron Stein’s honorable and serious character would be party to the fabrication of a paper of this sort. Even aside from this, I am in the thing as deeply as he; if it is signed with his signature, it is also sealed with my seal, which has not been out of my personal keeping in the ten years that I have been Chancellor here. In fact, the word “impossible” can be used to describe the entire business. It was impossible for the man Benjamin Bathurst to have entered the inn yard⁠—yet he did. It was impossible that he should carry papers of the sort found in his dispatch case, or that such papers should exist⁠—yet I am sending them to you with this letter. It is impossible that Baron von Stein should sign a paper of the sort he did, or that it should be sealed by the Chancellery⁠—yet it bears both Stein’s signature and my seal.</p>
				<p>You will also find in the dispatch case other credentials, ostensibly originating with the British Foreign Office, of the same character, being signed by persons having no connection with the Foreign Office, or even with the government, but being sealed with apparently authentic seals. If you send these papers to London, I fancy you will find that they will there create the same situation as that caused here by this letter of safe-conduct.</p>
				<p>I am also sending you a charcoal sketch of the person who calls himself Benjamin Bathurst. This portrait was taken without its subject’s knowledge. Baron von Krutz’s nephew, Lieutenant von Tarlburg, who is the son of our mutual friend Count von Tarlburg, has a little friend, a very clever young lady who is, as you will see, an expert at this sort of work: she was introduced into a room at the Ministry of Police and placed behind a screen, where she could sketch our prisoner’s face. If you should send this picture to London, I think that there is a good chance that it might be recognized. I can vouch that it is an excellent likeness.</p>
				<p>To tell the truth, we are at our wits’ end about this affair. I cannot understand how such excellent imitations of these various seals could be made, and the signature of the Baron von Stein is the most expert forgery that I have ever seen, in thirty years’ experience as a statesman. This would indicate careful and painstaking work on the part of somebody; how, then, do we reconcile this with such clumsy mistakes, recognizable as such by any schoolboy, as signing the name of Baron Stein as Prussian Chancellor, or <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> George Canning, who is a member of the opposition party and not connected with your government, as British Foreign secretary.</p>
				<p>These are mistakes which only a madman would make. There are those who think our prisoner is mad, because of his apparent delusions about the great conqueror, General Bonaparte, alias the Emperor Napoleon. Madmen have been known to fabricate evidence to support their delusions, it is true, but I shudder to think of a madman having at his disposal the resources to manufacture the papers you will find in this dispatch case. Moreover, some of our foremost medical men, who have specialized in the disorders of the mind, have interviewed this man Bathurst and say that, save for his fixed belief in a nonexistent situation, he is perfectly sane.</p>
				<p>Personally, I believe that the whole thing is a gigantic hoax, perpetrated for some hidden and sinister purpose, possibly to create confusion, and to undermine the confidence existing between your government and mine, and to set against one another various persons connected with both governments, or else as a mask for some other conspiratorial activity. Only a few months ago, you will recall, there was a Jacobin plot unmasked at Köln.</p>
				<p>But, whatever this business may portend, I do not like it. I want to get to the bottom of it as soon as possible, and I will thank you, my dear sir, and your government, for any assistance you may find possible.</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Count von Berchtenwald:</p>
				<p>Within the past half hour, that is, at about eleven o’clock tonight, the man calling himself Benjamin Bathurst was shot and killed by a sentry at the Ministry of Police, while attempting to escape from custody.</p>
				<p>A sentry on duty in the rear courtyard of the Ministry observed a man attempting to leave the building in a suspicious and furtive manner. This sentry, who was under the strictest orders to allow no one to enter or leave without written authorization, challenged him; when he attempted to run, the sentry fired his musket at him, bringing him down. At the shot, the Sergeant of the Guard rushed into the courtyard with his detail, and the man whom the sentry had shot was found to be the Englishman, Benjamin Bathurst. He had been hit in the chest with an ounce ball, and died before the doctor could arrive, and without recovering consciousness.</p>
				<p>An investigation revealed that the prisoner, who was confined on the third floor of the building, had fashioned a rope from his bedding, his bed cord, and the leather strap of his bell pull. This rope was only long enough to reach to the window of the office on the second floor, directly below, but he managed to enter this by kicking the glass out of the window. I am trying to find out how he could do this without being heard. I can assure you that somebody is going to smart for this night’s work. As for the sentry, he acted within his orders; I have commended him for doing his duty, and for good shooting, and I assume full responsibility for the death of the prisoner at his hands.</p>
				<p>I have no idea why the self-so-called Benjamin Bathurst, who, until now, was well-behaved and seemed to take his confinement philosophically, should suddenly make this rash and fatal attempt, unless it was because of those infernal dunderheads of madhouse doctors who have been bothering him. Only this afternoon they deliberately handed him a bundle of newspapers⁠—Prussian, Austrian, French, and English⁠—all dated within the last month. They wanted they said, to see how he would react. Well, God pardon them, they’ve found out!</p>
				<p>What do you think should be done about giving the body burial?</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">My dear Count von Berchtenwald:</p>
				<p>Reply from London to my letter of the 28th, which accompanied the dispatch case and the other papers, has finally come to hand. The papers which you wanted returned⁠—the copies of the statements taken at Perleburg, the letter to the Baron von Krutz from the police captain, Hartenstein, and the personal letter of Krutz’s nephew, Lieutenant von Tarlburg, and the letter of safe-conduct found in the dispatch case⁠—accompany herewith. I don’t know what the people at Whitehall did with the other papers; tossed them into the nearest fire, for my guess. Were I in your place, that’s where the papers I am returning would go.</p>
				<p>I have heard nothing, yet, from my dispatch of the 29th concerning the death of the man who called himself Benjamin Bathurst, but I doubt very much if any official notice will ever be taken of it. Your government had a perfect right to detain the fellow, and, that being the case, he attempted to escape at his own risk. After all, sentries are not required to carry loaded muskets in order to discourage them from putting their hands in their pockets.</p>
				<p>To hazard a purely unofficial opinion, I should not imagine that London is very much dissatisfied with this dénouement. His Majesty’s government are a hardheaded and matter-of-fact set of gentry who do not relish mysteries, least of all mysteries whose solution may be more disturbing than the original problem.</p>
				<p>This is entirely confidential, but those papers which were in that dispatch case kicked up the devil’s own row in London, with half the government bigwigs protesting their innocence to high Heaven, and the rest accusing one another of complicity in the hoax. If that was somebody’s intention, it was literally a howling success. For a while, it was even feared that there would be questions in Parliament, but eventually, the whole vexatious business was hushed.</p>
				<p>You may tell Count Tarlburg’s son that his little friend is a most talented young lady; her sketch was highly commended by no less an authority than Sir Thomas Lawrence, and here comes the most bedeviling part of a thoroughly bedeviled business. The picture was instantly recognized. It is a very fair likeness of Benjamin Bathurst, or, I should say, Sir Benjamin Bathurst, who is King’s lieutenant governor for the Crown Colony of Georgia. As Sir Thomas Lawrence did his portrait a few years back, he is in an excellent position to criticize the work of Lieutenant von Tarlburg’s young lady. However, Sir Benjamin Bathurst was known to have been in Savannah, attending to the duties of his office, and in the public eye, all the while that his double was in Prussia. Sir Benjamin does not have a twin brother. It has been suggested that this fellow might be a half-brother, but, as far as I know, there is no justification for this theory.</p>
				<p>The General Bonaparte, alias the Emperor Napoleon, who is given so much mention in the dispatches, seems also to have a counterpart in actual life; there is, in the French army, a Colonel of Artillery by that name, a Corsican who Gallicized his original name of Napolione Bonaparte. He is a most brilliant military theoretician; I am sure some of your own officers, like General Scharnhorst, could tell you about him. His loyalty to the French monarchy has never been questioned.</p>
				<p>This same correspondence to fact seems to crop up everywhere in that amazing collection of pseudo-dispatches and pseudo-State papers. The United States of America, you will recall, was the style by which the rebellious colonies referred to themselves, in the Declaration of Philadelphia. The James Madison who is mentioned as the current President of the United States is now living, in exile, in Switzerland. His alleged predecessor in office, Thomas Jefferson, was the author of the rebel Declaration; after the defeat of the rebels, he escaped to Havana, and died, several years ago, in the Principality of Lichtenstein.</p>
				<p>I was quite amused to find our old friend Cardinal Talleyrand⁠—without the ecclesiastical title⁠—cast in the role of chief adviser to the usurper, Bonaparte. His Eminence, I have always thought, is the sort of fellow who would land on his feet on top of any heap, and who would as little scruple to be Prime Minister to His Satanic Majesty as to His Most Christian Majesty.</p>
				<p>I was baffled, however, by one name, frequently mentioned in those fantastic papers. This was the English general, Wellington. I haven’t the least idea who this person might be.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Hunter Patrol</h2>
			<p class="authors">By <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Beam Piper and John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> McGuire</p>
			<p>At the crest of the ridge, Benson stopped for an instant, glancing first at his wristwatch and then back over his shoulder. It was 0539; the barrage was due in eleven minutes, at the spot where he was now standing. Behind, on the long northeast slope, he could see the columns of black oil smoke rising from what had been the Pan-Soviet advance supply dump. There was a great deal of firing going on, back there; he wondered if the Commies had managed to corner a few of his men, after the patrol had accomplished its mission and scattered, or if a couple of Communist units were shooting each other up in mutual mistaken identity. The result would be about the same in either case⁠—reserve units would be disorganized, and some men would have been pulled back from the front line. His dozen-odd <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> regulars and Turkish partisans had done their best to simulate a paratroop attack in force. At least, his job was done; now to execute that classic infantry maneuver described as, “Let’s get the hell outa here.” This was his last patrol before rotation home. He didn’t want anything unfortunate to happen.</p>
			<p>There was a little ravine to the left; the stream which had cut it in the steep southern slope of the ridge would be dry at this time of year, and he could make better time, and find protection in it from any chance shots when the interdictory barrage started. He hurried toward it and followed it down to the valley that would lead toward the front⁠—the thinly-held section of the Communist lines, and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> lines beyond, where fresh troops were waiting to jump from their holes and begin the attack.</p>
			<p>There was something wrong about this ravine, though. At first, it was only a vague presentiment, growing stronger as he followed the dry gully down to the valley below. Something he had smelled, or heard, or seen, without conscious recognition. Then, in the dry sand where the ravine debouched into the valley, he saw faint tank-tracks⁠—only one pair. There was something wrong about the vines that mantled one side of the ravine, too.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>An instant later, he was diving to the right, breaking his fall with the butt of his auto-carbine, rolling rapidly toward the cover of a rock, and as he did so, the thinking part of his mind recognized what was wrong. The tank-tracks had ended against the vine-grown side of the ravine, what he had smelled had been lubricating oil and petrol, and the leaves on some of the vines hung upside down.</p>
			<p>Almost at once, from behind the vines, a tank’s machine guns snarled at him, clipping the place where he had been standing, then shifting to rage against the sheltering rock. With a sudden motor-roar, the muzzle of a long tank-gun pushed out through the vines, and then the low body of a tank with a red star on the turret came rumbling out of the camouflaged bay. The machine guns kept him pinned behind the rock; the tank swerved ever so slightly so that its wide left tread was aimed directly at him, then picked up speed. Aren’t even going to waste a shell on me, he thought.</p>
			<p>Futilely, he let go a clip from his carbine, trying to hit one of the vision-slits; then rolled to one side, dropped out the clip, slapped in another. There was a shimmering blue mist around him. If he only hadn’t used his last grenade, back there at the supply-dump.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>The strange blue mist became a flickering radiance that ran through all the colors of the spectrum and became an utter, impenetrable blackness.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were voices in the blackness, and a softness under him, but under his back, when he had been lying on his stomach, as though he were now on a comfortable bed. They got me alive, he thought; now comes the brainwashing!</p>
			<p>He cracked one eye open imperceptibly. Lights, white and glaring, from a ceiling far above; walls as white as the lights. Without moving his head, he opened both eyes and shifted them from right to left. Vaguely, he could see people and, behind them, machines so simply designed that their functions were unguessable. He sat up and looked around groggily. The people, their costumes⁠—definitely not Pan-Soviet uniforms⁠—and the room and its machines, told him nothing. The hardness under his right hip was a welcome surprise; they hadn’t taken his pistol from him! Feigning even more puzzlement and weakness, he clutched his knees with his elbows and leaned his head forward on them, trying to collect his thoughts.</p>
			<p>“We shall have to give up, Gregory,” a voice trembled with disappointment.</p>
			<p>“Why, Anthony?” The new voice was deeper, more aggressive.</p>
			<p>“Look. Another typical reaction; retreat to the foetus.”</p>
			<p>Footsteps approached. Another voice, discouragement heavily weighting each syllable: “You’re right. He’s like all the others. We’ll have to send him back.”</p>
			<p>“And look for no more?” The voice he recognized as Anthony faltered between question and statement.</p>
			<p>A babel of voices, in dispute; then, clearly, the voice Benson had come to label as Gregory, cut in:</p>
			<p>“I will never give up!”</p>
			<p>He raised his head; there was something in the timbre of that voice reminding him of his own feelings in the dark days when the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> had everywhere been reeling back under the Pan-Soviet hammer-blows.</p>
			<p>“Anthony!” Gregory’s voice again; Benson saw the speaker; short, stocky, gray-haired, stubborn lines about the mouth. The face of a man chasing an illusive but not uncapturable dream.</p>
			<p>“That means nothing.” A tall thin man, too lean for the tunic-like garment he wore, was shaking his head.</p>
			<p>Deliberately, trying to remember his college courses in psychology, he forced himself to accept, and to assess, what he saw as reality. He was on a small table, like an operating table; the whole place looked like a medical lab or a clinic. He was still in uniform; his boots had soiled the white sheets with the dust of Armenia. He had all his equipment, including his pistol and combat-knife; his carbine was gone, however. He could feel the weight of his helmet on his head. The room still rocked and swayed a little, but the faces of the people were coming into focus.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He counted them, saying each number to himself: one, two, three, four, five men; one woman. He swung his feet over the edge of the table, being careful that it would be between him and the others when he rose, and began inching his right hand toward his right hip, using his left hand, on his brow, to misdirect attention.</p>
			<p>“I would classify his actions as arising from conscious effort at cortico-thalamic integration,” the woman said, like an archaeologist who has just found a K-ration tin at the bottom of a neolithic kitchen-midden. She had the peculiarly young-old look of the spinster teachers with whom Benson had worked before going to the war.</p>
			<p>“I want to believe it, but I’m afraid to,” another man for whom Benson had no name-association said. He was portly, gray-haired, arrogant-faced; he wore a short black jacket with a jewelled zipper-pull, and striped trousers.</p>
			<p>Benson cleared his throat. “Just who are you people?” he inquired. “And just where am I?”</p>
			<p>Anthony grabbed Gregory’s hand and pumped it frantically.</p>
			<p>“I’ve dreamed of the day when I could say this!” he cried. “Congratulations, Gregory!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>That touched off another bedlam, of joy, this time, instead of despair. Benson hid his amusement at the facility with which all of them were discovering in one another the courage, vision and stamina of true patriots and pioneers. He let it go on for a few moments, hoping to glean some clue. Finally, he interrupted.</p>
			<p>“I believe I asked a couple of questions,” he said, using the voice he reserved for sergeants and second lieutenants. “I hate to break up this mutual admiration session, but I would appreciate some answers. This isn’t anything like the situation I last remember.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“He remembers!” Gregory exclaimed. “That confirms your first derivation by symbolic logic, and it strengthens the validity of the second.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>The schoolteacherish woman began jabbering excitedly; she ran through about a paragraph of what was pure gobbledegook to Benson, before the man with the arrogant face and the jewelled zipper-pull broke in on her.</p>
			<p>“Save that for later, Paula,” he barked. “I’d be very much interested in your theories about why memories are unimpaired when you time-jump forward and lost when you reverse the process, but let’s stick to business. We have what we wanted; now let’s use what we have.”</p>
			<p>“I never liked the way you made your money,” a dark-faced, cadaverous man said, “but when you talk, it makes sense. Let’s get on with it.”</p>
			<p>Benson used the brief silence which followed to study the six. With the exception of the two who had just spoken, there was the indefinable mark of the fanatic upon all of them⁠—people fanatical about different things, united for different reasons in a single purpose. It reminded him sharply of some teachers’ committee about to beard a school-board with an unpopular and expensive recommendation.</p>
			<p>Anthony⁠—the oldest of the lot, in a knee-length tunic⁠—turned to Gregory.</p>
			<p>“I believe you had better.⁠ ⁠…” he began.</p>
			<p>“As to who we are, we’ll explain that, partially, later. As for your question, ‘Where am I?’ that will have to be rephrased. If you ask, ‘When and where am I?’ I can furnish a rational answer. In the temporal dimension, you are fifty years futureward of the day of your death; spatially, you are about eight thousand miles from the place of your death, in what is now the World Capitol, <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis.”</p>
			<p>Nothing in the answer made sense but the name of the city. Benson chuckled.</p>
			<p>“What happened; the Cardinals conquer the world? I knew they had a good team, but I didn’t think it was that good.”</p>
			<p>“No, no,” Gregory told him earnestly. “The government isn’t a theocracy. At least not yet. But if The Guide keeps on insisting that only beautiful things are good and that he is uniquely qualified to define beauty, watch his rule change into just that.”</p>
			<p>“I’ve been detecting symptoms of religious paranoia, messianic delusions, about his public statements.⁠ ⁠…” the woman began.</p>
			<p>“Idolatry!” another member of the group, who wore a black coat fastened to the neck, and white neckbands, rasped. “Idolatry in deed, as well as in spirit!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The sense of unreality, partially dispelled, began to return. Benson dropped to the floor and stood beside the table, getting a cigarette out of his pocket and lighting it.</p>
			<p>“I made a joke,” he said, putting his lighter away. “The fact that none of you got it has done more to prove that I am fifty years in the future than anything any of you could say.” He went on to explain who the <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis Cardinals were.</p>
			<p>“Yes; I remember! Baseball!” Anthony exclaimed. “There is no baseball, now. The Guide will not allow competitive sports; he says that they foster the spirit of violence.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>The cadaverous man in the blue jacket turned to the man in the black garment of similar cut.</p>
			<p>“You probably know more history than any of us,” he said, getting a cigar out of his pocket and lighting it. He lighted it by rubbing the end on the sole of his shoe. “Suppose you tell him what the score is.” He turned to Benson. “You can rely on his dates and happenings; his interpretation’s strictly capitalist, of course,” he said.</p>
			<p>Black-jacket shook his head. “You first, Gregory,” he said. “Tell him how he got here, and then I’ll tell him why.”</p>
			<p>“I believe,” Gregory began, “that in your period, fiction writers made some use of the subject of time-travel. It was not, however, given serious consideration, largely because of certain alleged paradoxes involved, and because of an elementalistic and objectifying attitude toward the whole subject of time. I won’t go into the mathematics and symbolic logic involved, but we have disposed of the objections; more, we have succeeded in constructing a time machine, if you want to call it that. We prefer to call it a temporal-spatial displacement field generator.”</p>
			<p>“It’s really very simple,” the woman called Paula interrupted. “If the universe is expanding, time is a widening spiral; if contracting, a diminishing spiral; if static, a uniform spiral. The possibility of pulsation was our only worry.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“That’s no worry,” Gregory reproved her. “I showed you that the rate was too slow to have an effect on.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Oh, nonsense; you can measure something which exists within a microsecond, but where is the instrument to measure a temporal pulsation that may require years.⁠ ⁠… ? You haven’t come to that yet.”</p>
			<p>“Be quiet, both of you!” the man with the black coat and the white bands commanded. “While you argue about vanities, thousands are being converted to the godlessness of The Guide, and other thousands of his dupes are dying, unprepared to face their Maker!”</p>
			<p>“All right, you invented a time machine,” Benson said. “In civvies, I was only a high school chemistry teacher. I can tell a class of juniors the difference between H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, but the theory of time-travel is wasted on me.⁠ ⁠… Suppose you just let me ask the questions; then I’ll be sure of finding out what I don’t know. For instance, who won the war I was fighting in, before you grabbed me and brought me here? The Commies?”</p>
			<p>“No, the United Nations,” Anthony told him. “At least, they were the least exhausted when both sides decided to quit.”</p>
			<p>“Then what’s this dictatorship.⁠ ⁠… The Guide? Extreme Rightist?”</p>
			<p>“Walter, you’d better tell him,” Gregory said.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“We damn near lost the war,” the man in the black jacket and striped trousers said, “but for once, we won the peace. The Soviet Bloc was broken up⁠—India, China, Indonesia, Mongolia, Russia, the Ukraine, all the Satellite States. Most of them turned into little dictatorships, like the Latin American countries after the liberation from Spain, but they were personal, non-ideological, generally benevolent, dictatorships, the kind that can grow into democracies, if they’re given time.”</p>
			<p>“Capitalistic dictatorships, he means,” the cadaverous man in the blue jacket explained.</p>
			<p>“Be quiet, Carl,” Anthony told him. “Let’s not confuse this with any class-struggle stuff.”</p>
			<p>“Actually, the United Nations rules the world,” Walter continued. “What goes on in the Ukraine or Latvia or Manchuria is about analogous to what went on under the old United States government in, let’s say, Tammany-ruled New York. But here’s the catch. The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> is ruled absolutely by one man.”</p>
			<p>“How could that happen? In my time, the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> had its functions so subdivided and compartmented that it couldn’t even run a war properly. Our army commanders were making war by systematic disobedience.”</p>
			<p>“The charter was changed shortly after⁠ ⁠… er, that is, after.⁠ ⁠…” Walter was fumbling for words.</p>
			<p>“After my death.” Benson finished politely. “Go on. Even with a changed charter, how did one man get all the powers into his hands?”</p>
			<p>“By sorcery!” black-coat-and-white-bands fairly shouted. “By the help of his master, Satan!”</p>
			<p>“You know, there are times when some such theory tempts me,” Paula said.</p>
			<p>“He was a big moneybags,” Carl said. “He bribed his way in, New York was bombed flat. Where the old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> buildings were, it’s still hot. So The Guide donated a big tract of land outside <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis, built these buildings⁠—we’re in the basement of one of them, right now, if you want a good laugh⁠—and before long, he had the whole organization eating out of his hand. They just voted him into power, and the world into slavery.”</p>
			<p>Benson looked around at the others, who were nodding in varying degrees of agreement.</p>
			<p>“Substantially, that’s it. He managed to convince everybody of his altruism, integrity and wisdom,” Walter said. “It was almost blasphemous to say anything against him. I really don’t understand how it happened.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Well, what’s he been doing with his power?” Benson asked. “Wise things, or stupid ones?”</p>
			<p>“I could be general, and say that he has deprived all of us of our political and other liberties. It is best to be specific,” Anthony said. “Gregory?”</p>
			<p>“My own field⁠—dimensional physics⁠—hasn’t been interfered with much, yet. It’s different in other fields. For instance, all research in sonics has been arbitrarily stopped. So has a great deal of work in organic and synthetic chemistry. Psychology is a madhouse of⁠ ⁠… what was the old word, licentiousness? No, lysenkoism. Medicine and surgery⁠—well, there’s a huge program of compulsory sterilization, and another one of eugenic marriage-control. And infants who don’t conform to certain physical standards don’t survive. Neither do people who have disfiguring accidents beyond the power of plastic surgery.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Paula spoke next. “My field is child welfare. Well, I’m going to show you an audiovisual of an interesting ceremony in a Hindu village, derived from the ancient custom of the sati. It is the Hindu method of conforming to The Guide’s demand that only beautiful children be allowed to grow to maturity.”</p>
			<p>The film was mercifully brief. Even in spite of the drums and gongs, and the chanting of the crowd, Benson found out how loudly a newborn infant can scream in a fire. The others looked as though they were going to be sick; he doubted if he looked much better.</p>
			<p>“Of course, we are a more practical and mechanical-minded people, here and in Europe,” Paula added, holding down her gorge by main strength. “We have lethal-gas chambers that even Hitler would have envied.”</p>
			<p>“I am a musician,” Anthony said. “A composer. If Gregory thinks that the sciences are controlled, he should try to write even the simplest piece of music. The extent of censorship and control over all the arts, and especially music, is incredible.” He coughed slightly. “And I have another motive, a more selfish one. I am approaching the compulsory retirement age; I will soon be invited to go to one of the Havens. Even though these Havens are located in the most barren places, they are beauty-spots, verdant beyond belief. It is of only passing interest that, while large numbers of the aged go there yearly, their populations remain constant, and, to judge from the quantities of supplies shipped to them, extremely small.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“They call me Samuel, in this organization,” the man in the long black coat said. “Whoever gave me that alias must have chosen it because I am here in an effort to live up to it. Although I am ordained by no church, I fight for all of them. The plain fact is that this man we call The Guide is really the Antichrist!”</p>
			<p>“Well, I haven’t quite so lofty a motive, but it’s good enough to make me willing to finance this project,” Walter said. “It’s very simple. The Guide won’t let people make money, and if they do, he taxes it away from them. And he has laws to prohibit inheritance; what little you can accumulate, you can’t pass on to your children.”</p>
			<p>“I put up a lot of the money, too, don’t forget,” Carl told him. “Or the Union did; I’m a poor man, myself.” He was smoking an excellent cigar, for a poor man, and his clothes could have come from the same tailor as Walter’s. “Look, we got a real Union⁠—the Union of all unions. Every working man in North America, Europe, Australia and South Africa belongs to it. And The Guide has us all hog-tied.”</p>
			<p>“He won’t let you strike,” Benson chuckled.</p>
			<p>“That’s right. And what can we do? Why, we can’t even make our closed-shop contracts stick. And as far as getting anything like a pay-raise.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Good thing. Another pay-raise in some of my companies would bankrupt them, the way The Guide has us under his thumb.⁠ ⁠…” Walter began, but he was cut off.</p>
			<p>“Well! It seems as though this Guide has done some good, if he’s made you two realize that you’re both on the same side, and that what hurts one hurts both,” Benson said. “When I shipped out for Turkey in ’77, neither Labor nor Management had learned that.” He looked from one to another of them. “The Guide must have a really good bodyguard, with all the enemies he’s made.”</p>
			<p>Gregory shook his head. “He lives virtually alone, in a very small house on the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> Capitol grounds. In fact, except for a small police-force, armed only with nonlethal stun-guns, your profession of arms is nonexistent.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“I’ve been guessing what you want me to do,” Benson said. “You want this Guide bumped off. But why can’t any of you do it? Or, if it’s too risky, at least somebody from your own time? Why me?”</p>
			<p>“We can’t. Everybody in the world today is conditioned against violence, especially the taking of human life,” Anthony told him.</p>
			<p>“Now, wait a moment!” This time, he was using the voice he would have employed in chiding a couple of Anatolian peasant partisans who were field-stripping a machine gun the wrong way. “Those babies in that film you showed me weren’t dying of old age.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“That is not violence,” Paula said bitterly. “That is humane beneficence. Ugly people would be unhappy, and would make others unhappy, in a world where everybody else is beautiful.”</p>
			<p>“And all these oppressive and tyrannical laws,” Benson continued. “How does he enforce them, without violence, actual or threatened?”</p>
			<p>Samuel started to say something about the Power of the Evil One; Paula, ignoring him, said:</p>
			<p>“I really don’t know; he just does it. Mass hypnotism of some sort. I know music has something to do with it, because there is always music, everywhere. This laboratory, for instance, was secretly soundproofed; we couldn’t have worked here, otherwise.”</p>
			<p>“All right. I can see that you’d need somebody from the past, preferably a soldier, whose conditioning has been in favor rather than against violence. I’m not the only one you snatched, I take it?”</p>
			<p>“No. We’ve been using that machine to pick up men from battlefields all over the world and all over history,” Gregory said. “Until now, none of them could adjust.⁠ ⁠… Uggh!” He shuddered, looking even sicker than when the film was being shown.</p>
			<p>“He’s thinking,” Walter said, “about a French officer from Waterloo who blew out his brains with a pocket-pistol on that table, and an English archer from Agincourt who ran amok with a dagger in here, and a trooper of the Seventh Cavalry from the Custer Massacre.”</p>
			<p>Gregory managed to overcome his revulsion. “You see, we were forced to take our subjects largely at random with regard to individual characteristics, mental attitudes, adaptability, et cetera.” As long as he stuck to high order abstractions, he could control himself. “Aside from their professional lack of repugnance for violence, we took soldiers from battlefields because we could select men facing immediate death, whose removal from the past would not have any effect upon the casual chain of events affecting the present.”</p>
			<p>A warning buzzer rasped in Benson’s brain. He nodded, poker-faced.</p>
			<p>“I can see that,” he agreed. “You wouldn’t dare do anything to change the past. That was always one of the favorite paradoxes in time-travel fiction.⁠ ⁠… Well, I think I have the general picture. You have a dictator who is tyrannizing you; you want to get rid of him; you can’t kill him yourselves. I’m opposed to dictators, myself; that⁠—and the Selective Service law, of course⁠—was why I was a soldier. I have no moral or psychological taboos against killing dictators, or anybody else. Suppose I cooperate with you; what’s in it for me?”</p>
			<p>There was a long silence. Walter and Carl looked at one another inquiringly; the others dithered helplessly. It was Carl who answered.</p>
			<p>“Your return to your own time and place.”</p>
			<p>“And if I don’t cooperate with you?”</p>
			<p>“Guess when and where else we could send you,” Walter said.</p>
			<p>Benson dropped his cigarette and tramped it.</p>
			<p>“Exactly the same time and place?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, the structure of space-time demands.⁠ ⁠…” Paula began.</p>
			<p>“The spatiotemporal displacement field is capable of identifying that spot⁠—” Gregory pointed to a ten-foot circle in front of a bank of sleek-cabineted, dial-studded machines “⁠—with any set of space-time coordinates in the universe. However, to avoid disruption of the structure of space-time, we must return you to approximately the same point in space-time.”</p>
			<p>Benson nodded again, this time at the confirmation of his earlier suspicion. Well, while he was alive, he still had a chance.</p>
			<p>“All right; tell me exactly what you want me to do.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A third outbreak of bedlam, this time of relief and frantic explanation.</p>
			<p>“Shut up, all of you!” For so thin a man, Carl had an astonishing voice. “I worked this out, so let me tell it.” He turned to Benson. “Maybe I’m tougher than the rest of them, or maybe I’m not as deeply conditioned. For one thing, I’m tone-deaf. Well, here’s the way it is. Gregory can set the machine to function automatically. You stand where he shows you, press the button he shows you, and fifteen seconds later it’ll take you forward in time five seconds and about a kilometer in space, to The Guide’s office. He’ll be at his desk now. You’ll have forty-five seconds to do the job, from the time the field collapses around you till it rebuilds. Then you’ll be taken back to your own time again. The whole thing’s automatic.”</p>
			<p>“Can do,” Benson agreed. “How do I kill him?”</p>
			<p>“I’m getting sick!” Paula murmured weakly. Her face was whiter than her gown.</p>
			<p>“Take care of her, Samuel. Both of you’d better get out of here,” Gregory said.</p>
			<p>“The Lord of Hosts is my strength, He will.⁠ ⁠… Uggggh!” Samuel gasped.</p>
			<p>“Conditioning’s getting him, too; we gotta be quick,” Carl said. “Here. This is what you’ll use.” He handed Benson a two-inch globe of black plastic. “Take the damn thing, quick! Little button on the side; press it, and get it out of your hand fast.⁠ ⁠…” He retched. “Limited-effect bomb; everything within two-meter circle burned to nothing; outside that, great but not unendurable heat. Shut your eyes when you throw it. Flash almost blinding.” He dropped his cigar and turned almost green in the face. Walter had a drink poured and handed it to him. “Uggh! Thanks, Walter.” He downed it.</p>
			<p>“Peculiar sort of thing for a nonviolent people to manufacture,” Benson said, looking at the bomb and then putting it in his jacket pocket.</p>
			<p>“It isn’t a weapon. Industrial; we use it in mining. I used plenty of them, in Walter’s iron mines.”</p>
			<p>He nodded again. “Where do I stand, now?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Right over here.” Gregory placed him in front of a small panel with three buttons. “Press the middle one, and step back into the small red circle and stand perfectly still while the field builds up and collapses. Face that way.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Benson drew his pistol and checked it; magazine full, a round in the chamber, safety on.</p>
			<p>“Put that horrid thing out of sight!” Anthony gasped. “The⁠ ⁠… the other thing⁠ ⁠… is what you want to use.”</p>
			<p>“The bomb won’t be any good if some of his guards come in before the field rebuilds,” Benson said.</p>
			<p>“He has no guards. He lives absolutely alone. We told you.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“I know you did. You probably believed it, too. I don’t. And by the way, you’re sending me forward. What do you do about the fact that a time-jump seems to make me pass out?”</p>
			<p>“Here. Before you press the button, swallow it.” Gregory gave him a small blue pill.</p>
			<p>“Well, I guess that’s all there is,” Gregory continued. “I hope.⁠ ⁠…” His face twitched, and he dropped to the floor with a thud. Carl and Walter came forward, dragged him away from the machine.</p>
			<p>“Conditioning got him. Getting me, too,” Walter said. “Hurry up, man!”</p>
			<p>Benson swallowed the pill, pressed the button and stepped back into the red circle, drawing his pistol and snapping off the safety. The blue mist closed in on him.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>This time, however, it did not thicken into blackness. It became luminous, brightening to a dazzle and dimming again to a colored mist, and then it cleared, while Benson stood at raise pistol, as though on a target range. He was facing a big desk at twenty feet, across a thick-piled blue rug. There was a man seated at the desk, a white-haired man with a mustache and a small beard, who wore a loose coat of some glossy plum-brown fabric, and a vividly blue neck-scarf.</p>
			<p>The pistol centered on the v-shaped blue under his chin. Deliberately, Benson squeezed, recovered from the recoil, aimed, fired, recovered, aimed, fired. Five seconds gone. The old man slumped across the desk, his arms extended. Better make a good job of it, six, seven, eight seconds; he stepped forward to the edge of the desk, call that fifteen seconds, and put the muzzle to the top of the man’s head, firing again and snapping on the safety. There had been something familiar about The Guide’s face, but it was too late to check on that, now. There wasn’t any face left; not even much head.</p>
			<p>A box, on the desk, caught Benson’s eye, a cardboard box with an envelope, stamped <q>Top Secret! For the Guide Only!</q> taped to it. He holstered his pistol and caught that up, stuffing it into his pocket, in obedience to an instinct to grab anything that looked like intelligence matter while in the enemy’s country. Then he stepped back to the spot where the field had deposited him. He had ten seconds to spare; somebody was banging on a door when the blue mist began to gather around him.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He was crouching, the spherical plastic object in his right hand, his thumb over the button, when the field collapsed. Sure enough, right in front of him, so close that he could smell the very heat of it, was the big tank with the red star on its turret. He cursed the sextet of sanctimonious double-crossers eight thousand miles and fifty years away in space-time. The machine guns had stopped⁠—probably because they couldn’t be depressed far enough to aim at him, now; that was a notorious fault of some of the newer Pan-Soviet tanks⁠—and he rocked back on his heels, pressed the button, and heaved, closing his eyes. As the thing left his fingers, he knew that he had thrown too hard. His muscles, accustomed to the heavier cast-iron grenades of his experience, had betrayed him. For a moment, he was closer to despair than at any other time in the whole phantasmagoric adventure. Then he was hit, with physical violence, by a wave of almost solid heat. It didn’t smell like the heat of the tank’s engines; it smelled like molten metal, with undertones of burned flesh. Immediately, there was a multiple explosion that threw him flat, as the tank’s ammunition went up. There were no screams. It was too fast for that. He opened his eyes.</p>
			<p>The turret and top armor of the tank had vanished. The two massive treads had been toppled over, one to either side. The body had collapsed between them, and it was running sticky trickles of molten metal. He blinked, rubbed his eyes on the back of his hand, and looked again. Of all the many blasted and burned-out tanks, Soviet and <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr>, that he had seen, this was the most completely wrecked thing in his experience. And he’d done that with one grenade.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>At that moment, there was a sudden rushing overhead, and an instant later the barrage began falling beyond the crest of the ridge. He looked at his watch, blinked, and looked again. That barrage was due at 0550; according to the watch, it was 0726. He was sure that, ten minutes ago, when he had looked at it, up there at the head of the ravine, it had been twenty minutes to six. He puzzled about that for a moment, and decided that he must have caught the stem on something and pulled it out, and then twisted it a little, setting the watch ahead. Then, somehow, the stem had gotten pushed back in, starting it at the new setting. That was a pretty farfetched explanation, but it was the only one he could think of.</p>
			<p>But about this tank, now. He was positive that he could remember throwing a grenade.⁠ ⁠… Yet he’d used his last grenade back there at the supply dump. He saw his carbine, and picked it up. That silly blackout he’d had, for a second, there; he must have dropped it. Action was open, empty magazine on the ground where he’d dropped it. He wondered, stupidly, if one of his bullets couldn’t have gone down the muzzle of the tank’s gun and exploded the shell in the chamber.⁠ ⁠… Oh, the hell with it! The tank might have been hit by a premature shot from the barrage which was raging against the far slope of the ridge. He reset his watch by guess and looked down the valley. The big attack would be starting any minute, now, and there would be fleeing Commies coming up the valley ahead of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> advance. He’d better get himself placed before they started coming in on him.</p>
			<p>He stopped thinking about the mystery of the blown-up tank, a solution to which seemed to dance maddeningly just out of his mental reach, and found himself a place among the rocks to wait. Down the valley he could hear everything from pistols to mortars going off, and shouting in three or four racial intonations. After a while, fugitive Communists began coming, many of them without their equipment, stumbling in their haste and looking back over their shoulders. Most of them avoided the mouth of the ravine and hurried by to the left or right, but one little clump, eight or ten, came up the dry streambed, and stopped a hundred and fifty yards from his hiding-place to make a stand. They were Hindus, with outsize helmets over their turbans. Two of them came ahead, carrying a machine gun, followed by a third with a flamethrower; the others retreated more slowly, firing their rifles to delay pursuit.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Cuddling the stock of his carbine to his cheek, he divided a ten-shot burst between the two machine-gunners, then, as a matter of principle, he shot the man with the flamethrower. He had a dislike for flamethrowers; he killed every enemy he found with one. The others dropped their rifles and raised their hands, screaming: “Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe! You no shoot, me no shoot!”</p>
			<p>A dozen men in <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> battledress came up and took them prisoner. Benson shouted to them, and then rose and came down to join them. They were British⁠—Argyle and Sutherland Highlanders, advertising the fact by inconspicuous bits of tartan on their uniforms. The subaltern in command looked at him and nodded.</p>
			<p>“Captain Benson? We were warned to be on watch for your patrol,” he said. “Any of the rest of you lads get out?”</p>
			<p>Benson shrugged. “We split up after the attack. You may run into a couple of them. Some are locals and don’t speak very good English. I’ve got to get back to Division, myself; what’s the best way?”</p>
			<p>“Down that way. You’ll overtake a couple of our walking wounded. If you don’t mind going slowly, they’ll show you the way to advance dressing station, and you can hitch a ride on an ambulance from there.”</p>
			<p>Benson nodded. Off on the left, there was a flurry of small-arms fire, ending in yells of “Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe!”⁠—the World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> version of “Kamarad”!</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>His company was a non-<abbr>T/O</abbr> outfit; he came directly under Division command and didn’t have to bother reporting to any regimental or brigade commanders. He walked for an hour with half a dozen lightly wounded Scots, rode for another hour on a big cat-truck loaded with casualties of six regiments and four races, and finally reached Division Rear, where both the Division and Corps commanders took time to compliment him on the part his last hunter patrol had played in the now complete breakthrough. His replacement, an equine-faced Spaniard with an imposing display of fruit-salad, was there, too; he solemnly took off the bracelet a refugee Caucasian goldsmith had made for his predecessor’s predecessor and gave it to the new commander of what had formerly been Benson’s Butchers. As he had expected, there was also another medal waiting for him.</p>
			<p>A medical check at Task Force Center got him a warning; his last patrol had brought him dangerously close to the edge of combat fatigue. Remembering the incidents of the tank and the unaccountably fast watch, and the mysterious box and envelope which he had found in his coat pocket, he agreed, saying nothing about the questions that were puzzling him. The Psychological Department was never too busy to refuse another case; they hunted patients gleefully, each psych-shark seeking in every one proof of his own particular theories. It was with relief that he watched them fill out the red tag which gave him a priority on jet transports for home.</p>
			<p>Ankara to Alexandria, Alexandria to Dakar, Dakar to Belém, Belém to the shattered skyline of New York, the “hurry-and-wait” procedures at Fort Carlisle, and, after the usual separation promotion, Major Fred Benson, late of Benson’s Butchers, was back at teaching high school juniors the difference between H<sub>2</sub>O and H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were two high schools in the city: McKinley High, on the east side, and Dwight Eisenhower High, on the west. A few blocks from McKinley was the Tulip Tavern, where the Eisenhower teachers came in the late afternoons; the McKinley faculty crossed town to do their after-school drinking on the west side. When Benson entered the Tulip Tavern, on a warm September afternoon, he found Bill Myers, the school psychologist, at one of the tables, smoking his pipe, checking over a stack of aptitude test forms, and drinking beer. He got a highball at the bar and carried it over to Bill’s table.</p>
			<p>“Oh, hi, Fred.” The psychologist separated the finished from the unfinished work with a sheet of yellow paper and crammed the whole business into his briefcase. “I was hoping somebody’d show up.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Benson lit a cigarette, sipped his highball. They talked at random⁠—school-talk; the progress of the war, now in its twelfth year; personal reminiscences, of the Turkish Theater where Benson had served, and the Madras Beachhead, where Myers had been.</p>
			<p>“Bring home any souvenirs?” Myers asked.</p>
			<p>“Not much. Couple of pistols, couple of knives, some pictures. I don’t remember what all; haven’t gotten around to unpacking them, yet.⁠ ⁠… I have a sixth of rye and some beer, at my rooms. Let’s go around and see what I did bring home.”</p>
			<p>They finished their drinks and went out.</p>
			<p>“What the devil’s that?” Myers said, pointing to the cardboard box with the envelope taped to it, when Benson lifted it out of the gray-green locker.</p>
			<p>“Bill, I don’t know,” Benson said. “I found it in the pocket of my coat, on my way back from my last hunter patrol.⁠ ⁠… I’ve never told anybody about this, before.”</p>
			<p>“That’s the damnedest story I’ve ever heard, and in my racket you hear some honeys,” Myers said, when he had finished. “You couldn’t have picked that thing up in some other way, deliberately forgotten the circumstances, and fabricated this story about the tank and the grenade and the discrepancy in your watch subconsciously as an explanation?”</p>
			<p>“My subconscious is a better liar than that,” Benson replied. “It would have cobbled up some kind of a story that would stand up. This business.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Top Secret! For the Guide Only!” Myers frowned. “That isn’t one of our marks, and if it were Soviet, it’d be trilingual, Russian, Hindi and Chinese.”</p>
			<p>“Well, let’s see what’s in it. I want this thing cleared up. I’ve been having some of the nastiest dreams, lately.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Well, be careful; it may be booby-trapped,” Myers said urgently.</p>
			<p>“Don’t worry; I will.”</p>
			<p>He used a knife to slice the envelope open without untaping it from the box, and exposed five sheets of typewritten onionskin paper. There was no letterhead, no salutation or address-line. Just a mass of chemical formulae, and a concise report on tests. It seemed to be a report on an improved syrup for a carbonated soft-drink. There were a few cryptic cautionary references to heightened physico-psychological effects.</p>
			<p>The box was opened with the same caution, but it proved as innocent of dangers as the envelope. It contained only a half-liter bottle, wax-sealed, containing a dark reddish-brown syrup.</p>
			<p>“There’s a lot of this stuff I don’t dig,” Benson said, tapping the sheets of onionskin. “I don’t even scratch the surface of this rigamarole about The Guide. I’m going to get to work on this sample in the lab, at school, though. Maybe we have something, here.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>At eight-thirty the next evening, after four and a half hours work, he stopped to check what he had found out.</p>
			<p>The school’s X-ray, an excellent one, had given him a complete picture of the molecular structure of the syrup. There were a couple of long-chain molecules that he could only believe after two reexaminations and a careful check of the machine, but with the help of the notes he could deduce how they had been put together. They would be the Ingredient Alpha and Ingredient Beta referred to in the notes.</p>
			<p>The components of the syrup were all simple and easily procurable with these two exceptions, as were the basic components from which these were made.</p>
			<p>The mechanical guinea-pig demonstrated that the syrup contained nothing harmful to human tissue.</p>
			<p>Of course, there were the warnings about heightened psycho-physiological effects.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>He stuck a poison-label on the bottle, locked it up, and went home. The next day, he and Bill Myers got a bottle of carbonated water and mixed themselves a couple of drinks of it. It was delicious⁠—sweet, dry, tart, sour, all of these in alternating waves of pleasure.</p>
			<p>“We do have something, Bill,” he said. “We have something that’s going to give our income-tax experts headaches.”</p>
			<p>“You have,” Myers corrected. “Where do you start fitting me into it?”</p>
			<p>“We’re a good team, Bill. I’m a chemist, but I don’t know a thing about people. You’re a psychologist. A real one; not one of these night-school boys. A juvenile psychologist, too. And what age-group spends the most money in this country for soft-drinks?”</p>
			<p>Knowing the names of the syrup’s ingredients, and what their molecular structure was like, was only the beginning. Gallon after gallon of the School Board’s chemicals went down the laboratory sink; Fred Benson and Bill Myers almost lived in the fourth floor lab. Once or twice there were head-shaking warnings from the principal about the dangers of overwork. The watchmen, at all hours, would hear the occasional twanging of Benson’s guitar in the laboratory, and know that he had come to a dead end on something and was trying to think. Football season came and went; basketball season; the inevitable riot between McKinley and Eisenhower rooters; the Spring concerts. The term-end exams were only a month away when Benson and Myers finally did it, and stood solemnly, each with a beaker in either hand and took alternate sips of the original and the drink mixed from the syrup they had made.</p>
			<p>“Not a bit of difference, Fred,” Myers said. “We have it!”</p>
			<p>Benson picked up the guitar and began plunking on it.</p>
			<p>“Hey!” Myers exclaimed. “Have you been finding time to take lessons on that thing? I never heard you play as well as that!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They decided to go into business in <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis. It was centrally located, and, being behind more concentric circles of radar and counter-rocket defenses, it was in better shape than any other city in the country and most likely to stay that way. Getting started wasn’t hard; the first banker who tasted the new drink-named Evri-Flave, at Myers’ suggestion⁠—couldn’t dig up the necessary money fast enough. Evri-Flave hit the market with a bang and became an instant success; soon the rainbow-tinted vending machines were everywhere, dispensing the slender, slightly flattened bottles and devouring quarters voraciously. In spite of high taxes and the difficulties of doing business in a consumers’ economy upon which a wartime economy had been superimposed, both Myers and Benson were rapidly becoming wealthy. The gregarious Myers installed himself in a luxurious apartment in the city; Benson bought a large tract of land down the river toward Carondelet and started building a home and landscaping the grounds.</p>
			<p>The dreams began bothering him again, now that the urgency of getting Evri-Flave, <abbr>Inc.</abbr>, started had eased. They were not dreams of the men he had killed in battle, or, except for one about a huge, hot-smelling tank with a red star on the turret, about the war. Generally, they were about a strange, beautiful, office-room, in which a young man in uniform killed an older man in a plum-brown coat and a vivid blue neck-scarf. Sometimes Benson identified himself with the killer; sometimes with the old man who was killed.</p>
			<p>He talked to Myers about these dreams, but beyond generalities about delayed effects of combat fatigue and vague advice to relax, the psychologist, now head of Sales &amp; Promotion of Evri-Flave, <abbr>Inc.</abbr>, could give him no help.</p>
			<p>The war ended three years after the new company was launched. There was a momentary faltering of the economy, and then the work of reconstruction was crying hungrily for all the labor and capital that had been idled by the end of destruction, and more. There was a new flood-tide of prosperity, and Evri-Flave rode the crest. The estate at Carondelet was finished⁠—a beautiful place, surrounded with gardens, fragrant with flowers, full of the songs of birds and soft music from concealed record-players. It made him forget the ugliness of the war, and kept the dreams from returning so frequently. All the world ought to be like that, he thought; beautiful and quiet and peaceful. People surrounded with such beauty couldn’t think about war.</p>
			<p>All the world could be like that, if only.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> chose <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis for its new headquarters⁠—many of its offices had been moved there after the second and most destructive bombing of New York⁠—and when the city by the Mississippi began growing into a real World Capital, the flow of money into it almost squared overnight. Benson began to take an active part in politics in the new World Sovereignty party. He did not, however, allow his political activities to distract him from the work of expanding the company to which he owed his wealth and position. There were always things to worry about.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know,” Myers said to him, one evening, as they sat over a bottle of rye in the psychologist’s apartment. “I could make almost as much money practicing as a psychiatrist, these days. The whole world seems to be going pure, unadulterated nuts! That affair in Munich, for instance.”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” Benson grimaced as he thought of the affair in Munich⁠—a Wagnerian concert which had terminated in an insane orgy of mass suicide. “Just a week after we started our free-sample campaign in South Germany, too.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>He stopped short, downing his drink and coughing over it.</p>
			<p>“Bill! You remember those sheets of onionskin in that envelope?”</p>
			<p>“The foundation of our fortunes; I wonder where you really did get that.⁠ ⁠… Fred!” His eyes widened in horror. “That caution about ‘heightened psycho-physiological effects,’ that we were never able to understand!”</p>
			<p>Benson nodded grimly. “And think of all the crazy cases of mass-hysteria⁠—that baseball-game riot in Baltimore; the time everybody started tearing off each others’ clothes in Milwaukee; the sex-orgy in New Orleans. And the sharp uptrend in individual psychoneurotic and psychotic behavior. All in connection with music, too, and all after Evri-Flave got on the market.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll have to stop it; pull Evri-Flave off the market,” Myers said. “We can’t be responsible for letting this go on.”</p>
			<p>“We can’t stop, either. There’s at least a two months’ supply out in the hands of jobbers and distributors over whom we have no control. And we have all these contractual obligations, to buy the entire output of the companies that make the syrup for us; if we stop buying, they can sell it in competition with us, as long as they don’t infringe our trade-name. And we can’t prevent pirating. You know how easily we were able to duplicate that sample I brought back from Turkey. Why, our legal department’s kept busy all the time prosecuting unlicensed manufacturers as it is.”</p>
			<p>“We’ve got to do something, Fred!” There was almost a whiff of hysteria in Myers’ voice.</p>
			<p>“We will. We’ll start, first thing tomorrow, on a series of tests⁠—just you and I, like the old times at Eisenhower High. First, we want to be sure that Evri-Flave really is responsible. It’d be a hell of a thing if we started a public panic against our own product for nothing. And then.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It took just two weeks, in a soundproofed and guarded laboratory on Benson’s Carondelet estate, to convict their delicious drink of responsibility for that Munich State Opera House Horror and everything else. Reports from confidential investigators in Munich confirmed this. It had, of course, been impossible to interview the two thousand men and women who had turned the Opera House into a pyre for their own immolation, but none of the tiny minority who had kept their sanity and saved their lives had tasted Evri-Flave.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It took another month to find out exactly how the stuff affected the human nervous system, and they almost wrecked their own nervous systems in the process. The real villain, they discovered, was the incredible-looking long-chain compound alluded to in the original notes as Ingredient Beta; its principal physiological effect was to greatly increase the sensitivity of the aural nerves. Not only was the hearing range widened⁠—after consuming thirty <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.C.</abbr> of Beta, they could hear the sound of an ultrasonic dog-whistle quite plainly⁠—but the very quality of all audible sounds was curiously enhanced and altered. Myers, the psychologist, who was also well grounded in neurology, explained how the chemical produced this effect; it meant about as much to Benson as some of his chemistry did to Bill Myers. There was also a secondary, purely psychological, effect. Certain musical chords had definite effects on the emotions of the hearer, and the subject, beside being directly influenced by the music, was rendered extremely open to verbal suggestions accompanied by a suitable musical background.</p>
			<p>Benson transferred the final results of this stage of the research to the black notebook and burned the scratch-sheets.</p>
			<p>“That’s how it happened, then,” he said. “The Munich thing was the result of all that Götterdämmerung music. There was a band at the baseball park in Baltimore. The New Orleans Orgy started while a local radio station was broadcasting some of this new dance-music. Look, these tone-clusters, here, have a definite sex-excitation effect. This series of six chords, which occur in some of the Wagnerian stuff; effect, a combined feeling of godlike isolation and despair. And these consecutive fifths⁠—a sense of danger, anger, combativeness. You know, we could work out a whole range of emotional stimuli to fit the effects of Ingredient Beta.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“We don’t want to,” Myers said. “We want to work out a substitute for Beta that will keep the flavor of the drink without the psycho-physiological effects.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sure. I have some of the boys at the plant lab working on that. Gave them a lot of syrup without Beta, and told them to work out cheap additives to restore the regular Evri-Flave taste; told them it was an effort to find a cheap substitute for an expensive ingredient. But look, Bill. You and I both see, for instance, that a powerful worldwide supranational sovereignty is the only guarantee of world peace. If we could use something like this to help overcome antiquated verbal prejudices and nationalistic emotional attachments.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“No!” Myers said. “I won’t ever consent to anything like that, Fred! Not even in a cause like world peace; use a thing like this for a good, almost holy, cause now, and tomorrow we, or those who would come after us, would be using it to create a tyranny. You know what year this is, Bill?”</p>
			<p>“Why, 1984,” Benson said.</p>
			<p>“Yes. You remember that old political novel of Orwell’s, written about forty years ago? Well, that’s a picture of the kind of world you’d have, eventually, no matter what kind of a world you started out to make. Fred, don’t ever think of using this stuff for a purpose like that. If you try it, I’ll fight you with every resource I have.”</p>
			<p>There was a fanatical, almost murderous, look in Bill Myers’ eyes. Benson put the notebook in his pocket, then laughed and threw up his hands.</p>
			<p>“Hey, Joe! Hey, Joe!” he cried. “You’re right, of course, Bill. We can’t even trust the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> with a thing like this. It makes the <abbr>H</abbr>-bomb look like a stone hatchet.⁠ ⁠… Well, I’ll call Grant, at the plant lab, and see how his boys are coming along with the substitute; as soon as we get it, we can put out a confidential letter to all our distributors and syrup-manufacturers.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He walked alone in the garden at Carondelet, watching the color fade out of the sky and the twilight seep in among the clipped yews. All the world could be like this garden, a place of peace and beauty and quiet, if only.⁠ ⁠… All the world <em>would</em> be a beautiful and peaceful garden, in his own lifetime! He had the means of making it so!</p>
			<p>Three weeks later, he murdered his friend and partner, Bill Myers. It was a suicide; nobody but Fred Benson knew that he had taken fifty <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.C.</abbr> of pure Ingredient Beta in a couple of cocktails while listening to the queer phonograph record that he had played half an hour before blowing his brains out.</p>
			<p>The decision had cost Benson a battle with his conscience from which he had emerged the sole survivor. The conscience was buried along with Bill Myers, and all that remained was a purpose.</p>
			<p>Evri-Flave stayed on the market unaltered. The night before the national election, the World Sovereignty party distributed thousands of gallons of Evri-Flave; their speakers, on every radio and television network, were backgrounded by soft music. The next day, when the vote was counted, it was found that the American Nationalists had carried a few backwoods precincts in the Rockies and the Southern Appalachians and one county in Alaska, where there had been no distribution of Evri-Flave.</p>
			<p>The dreams came back more often, now that Bill Myers was gone. Benson was only beginning to realize what a large fact in his life the companionship of the young psychologist had been. Well, a world of peace and beauty was an omelet worth the breaking of many eggs.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>He purchased another great tract of land near the city, and donated it to the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> for their new headquarters buildings; the same architects and landscapists who had created the estate at Carondelet were put to work on it. In the middle of what was to become World City, they erected a small home for Fred Benson. Benson was often invited to address the delegates to the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr>; always, there was soft piped-in music behind his words. He saw to it that Evri-Flave was available free to all <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> personnel. The Senate of the United States elected him as perpetual <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.</abbr> delegate-in-chief to the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr>; not long after, the Security Council elected him their perpetual chairman.</p>
			<p>In keeping with his new dignities, and to ameliorate his youthful appearance, he grew a mustache and, eventually, a small beard. The black notebook in which he kept the records of his experiments was always with him; page after page was filled with notes. Experiments in sonics, like the one which had produced the ultrasonic stun-gun which rendered lethal weapons unnecessary for police and defense purposes, or the new musical combinations with which he was able to play upon every emotion and instinct.</p>
			<p>But he still dreamed, the same recurring dream of the young soldier and the old man in the office. By now, he was consistently identifying himself with the latter. He took to carrying one of the thick-barrelled stun-pistols always, now. Alone, he practiced constantly with it, drawing, breaking soap-bubbles with the concentrated sound-waves it projected. It was silly, perhaps, but it helped him in his dreams. Now, the old man with whom he identified himself would draw a stun-pistol, occasionally, to defend himself.</p>
			<p>The years drained one by one through the hourglass of Time. Year after year, the world grew more peaceful, more beautiful. There were no more incidents like the mass-suicide of Munich or the mass-perversions of New Orleans; the playing and even the composing of music was strictly controlled⁠—no dangerous notes or chords could be played in a world drenched with Ingredient Beta. Steadily the idea grew that peace and beauty were supremely good, that violence and ugliness were supremely evil. Even competitive sports which simulated violence; even children born ugly and misshapen.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He finished the breakfast which he had prepared for himself⁠—he trusted no food that another had touched⁠—and knotted the vivid blue scarf about his neck before slipping into the loose coat of glossy plum-brown, then checked the stun-pistol and pocketed the black notebook, its plastileather cover glossy from long use. He stood in front of the mirror, brushing his beard, now snow-white. Two years, now, and he would be eighty⁠—had he been anyone but The Guide, he would have long ago retired to the absolute peace and repose of one of the Elders’ Havens. Peace and repose, however, were not for The Guide; it would take another twenty years to finish his task of remaking the world, and he would need every day of it that his medical staff could borrow or steal for him. He made an eye-baffling practice draw with the stun-pistol, then holstered it and started down the spiral stairway to the office below.</p>
			<p>There was the usual mass of papers on his desk. A corps of secretaries had screened out everything but what required his own personal and immediate attention, but the business of guiding a world could only be reduced to a certain point. On top was the digest of the world’s news for the past twenty-four hours, and below that was the agenda for the afternoon’s meeting of the Council. He laid both in front of him, reading over the former and occasionally making a note on the latter. Once his glance strayed to the cardboard box in front of him, with the envelope taped to it⁠—the latest improvement on the Evri-Flave syrup, with the report from his own chemists, all conditioned to obedience, loyalty and secrecy. If they thought he was going to try that damned stuff on himself.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>There was a sudden gleam of light in the middle of the room, in front of his desk. No, a mist, through which a blue light seemed to shine. The stun-pistol was in his hand⁠—his instinctive reaction to anything unusual⁠—and pointed into the shining mist when it vanished and a man appeared in front of him; a man in the baggy green combat-uniform that he himself had worn fifty years before; a man with a heavy automatic pistol in his hand. The gun was pointed directly at him.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Guide aimed quickly and pressed the trigger of the ultrasonic stunner. The pistol dropped soundlessly on the thick-piled rug; the man in uniform slumped in an inert heap. The Guide sprang to his feet and rounded the desk, crossing to and bending over the intruder. Why, this was the dream that had plagued him through the years. But it was ending differently. The young man⁠—his face was startlingly familiar, somehow⁠—was not killing the old man. Those years of practice with the stun-pistol.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>He stooped and picked the automatic up. The young man was unconscious, and The Guide had his pistol, now. He slipped the automatic into his pocket and straightened beside his inert would-be slayer.</p>
			<p>A shimmering globe of blue mist appeared around them, brightened to a dazzle, and dimmed again to a colored mist before it vanished, and when it cleared away, he was standing beside the man in uniform, in the sandy bed of a dry stream at the mouth of a little ravine, and directly in front of him, looming above him, was a thing that had not been seen in the world for close to half a century⁠—a big, hot-smelling tank with a red star on its turret.</p>
			<p>He might have screamed⁠—the din of its treads and engines deafened him⁠—and, in panic, he turned and ran, his old legs racing, his old heart pumping madly. The noise of the tank increased as machine guns joined the uproar. He felt the first bullet strike him, just above the hips⁠—no pain; just a tremendous impact. He might have felt the second bullet, too, as the ground tilted and rushed up at his face. Then he was diving into a tunnel of blackness that had no end.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Captain Fred Benson, of Benson’s Butchers, had been jerked back into consciousness when the field began to build around him. He was struggling to rise, fumbling the grenade out of his pocket, when it collapsed. Sure enough, right in front of him, so close that he could smell the very heat of it, was the big tank with the red star on its turret. He cursed the sextet of sanctimonious double-crossers eight thousand miles and fifty years away in space-time. The machine guns had stopped⁠—probably because they couldn’t be depressed far enough to aim at him, now; that was a notorious fault of some of the newer Pan-Soviet tanks. He had the bomb out of his pocket, when the machine guns began firing again, this time at something on his left. Wondering what had created the diversion, he rocked back on his heels, pressed the button, and heaved, closing his eyes. As the thing left his fingers, he knew that he had thrown too hard. His muscles, accustomed to the heavier cast-iron grenades, had betrayed him. For a moment, he was closer to despair than at any other time in the whole phantasmagoric adventure. Then he was hit, with physical force, by a wave of almost solid heat. It didn’t smell like the heat of the tank’s engines; it smelled like molten metal, with undertones of burned flesh. Immediately, there was a multiple explosion that threw him flat, as the tank’s ammunition went up. There were no screams. It was too fast for that. He opened his eyes.</p>
			<p>The turret and top armor of the tank had vanished. The two massive treads had been toppled over, one to either side. The body had collapsed between them, and it was running sticky trickles of molten metal. He blinked, rubbed his eyes on the back of his hand, and looked again. Of all the many blasted and burned-out tanks, Soviet and <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr>, that he had seen, this was the most completely wrecked thing in his experience. And he’d done that with one grenade.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>Remembering the curious manner in which, at the last, the tank had begun firing at something to the side, he looked around, to see the crumpled body in the pale violet-gray trousers and the plum-brown coat. Finding his carbine and reloading it, he went over to the dead man, turning the body over. He was an old man, with a white mustache and a small white beard⁠—why, if the mustache were smaller and there were no beard, he would pass for Benson’s own father, who had died in 1962. The clothes weren’t Turkish or Armenian or Persian, or anything one would expect in this country.</p>
			<p>The old man had a pistol in his coat pocket, and Benson pulled it out and looked at it, then did a double-take and grabbed for his own holster, to find it empty. The pistol was his own 9.5 Colt automatic. He looked at the dead man, with the white beard and the vivid blue neck-scarf, and he was sure that he had never seen him before. He’d had that pistol when he’d come down the ravine.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>There was another pistol under the dead man’s coat, in a shoulder-holster; a queer thing with a thick round barrel, like an old percussion pepper-box, and a diaphragm instead of a muzzle. Probably projected ultrasonic waves. He holstered his own Colt and pocketed the unknown weapon. There was a black plastileather-bound notebook. It was full of notes. Chemical formulae, yes, and some stuff on sonics; that tied in with the queer pistol. He pocketed that. He’d look both over, when he had time and privacy, two scarce commodities in the Army.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>At that moment, there was a sudden rushing overhead, and an instant later, the barrage began falling beyond the crest of the ridge. He looked at his watch, blinked, and looked again. That barrage was due at 0550; according to his watch, it was 0726. That was another mystery, to go with the question of who the dead man was, where he had come from, and how he’d gotten hold of Benson’s pistol. Yes, and how that tank had gotten blown up. Benson was sure he had used his last grenade back at the supply-dump.</p>
			<p>The hell with it; he’d worry about all that later. The attack was due any minute, now, and there would be fleeing Commies coming up the valley ahead, of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> advance. He’d better get himself placed before they started coming in on him.</p>
			<p>He stopped thinking about the multiple mystery, a solution to which seemed to dance maddeningly just out of his mental reach, and found himself a place among the rocks to wait, and while he waited, he looked over the plastileather-bound notebook. In civil life, he had been a high school chemistry teacher, but the stuff in this book was utterly new to him. Some of it he could understand readily enough; the rest of it he could dig out for himself. Stuff about some kind of a carbonated soft-drink, and about a couple of unbelievable-looking long-chain molecules.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>After a while, fugitive Communists began coming up the valley to make their stand.</p>
			<p>Benson put away the notebook, picked up his carbine, and cuddled the stock to his cheek.⁠ ⁠…</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Last Enemy</h2>
			<p>Along the U-shaped table, the subdued clatter of dinnerware and the buzz of conversation was dying out; the soft music that drifted down from the overhead sound outlets seemed louder as the competing noises diminished. The feast was drawing to a close, and Dallona of Hadron fidgeted nervously with the stem of her wineglass as last-moment doubts assailed her.</p>
			<p>The old man at whose right she sat noticed, and reached out to lay his hand on hers.</p>
			<p>“My dear, you’re worried,” he said softly. “You, of all people, shouldn’t be, you know.”</p>
			<p>“The theory isn’t complete,” she replied. “And I could wish for more positive verification. I’d hate to think I’d got you into this⁠—”</p>
			<p>Garnon of Roxor laughed. “No, no!” he assured her. “I’d decided upon this long before you announced the results of your experiments. Ask Girzon; he’ll bear me out.”</p>
			<p>“That’s true,” the young man who sat at Garnon’s left said, leaning forward. “Father has meant to take this step for a long time. He was waiting until after the election, and then he decided to do it now, to give you an opportunity to make experimental use of it.”</p>
			<p>The man on Dallona’s right added his voice. Like the others at the table, he was of medium stature, brown-skinned and dark-eyed, with a wide mouth, prominent cheekbones and a short, square jaw. Unlike the others, he was armed, with a knife and pistol on his belt, and on the breast of his black tunic he wore a scarlet oval patch on which a pair of black wings, with a tapering silver object between them had been superimposed.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Lady Dallona; the Lord Garnon and I discussed this, oh, two years ago at the least. Really, I’m surprised that you seem to shrink from it, now. Of course, you’re Venus-born, and customs there may be different, but with your scientific knowledge⁠—”</p>
			<p>“That may be the trouble, Dirzed,” Dallona told him. “A scientist gets in the way of doubting, and one doubts one’s own theories most of all.”</p>
			<p>“That’s the scientific attitude, I’m told,” Dirzed replied, smiling. “But somehow, I cannot think of you as a scientist.” His eyes traveled over her in a way that would have made most women, scientists or otherwise, blush. It gave Dallona of Hadron a feeling of pleasure. Men often looked at her that way, especially here at Darsh. Novelty had something to do with it⁠—her skin was considerably lighter than usual, and there was a pleasing oddness about the structure of her face. Her alleged Venusian origin was probably accepted as the explanation of that, as of so many other things.</p>
			<p>As she was about to reply, a man in dark gray, one of the upper-servants who were accepted as social equals by the Akor-Neb nobles, approached the table. He nodded respectfully to Garnon of Roxor.</p>
			<p>“I hate to seem to hurry things, sir, but the boy’s ready. He’s in a trance-state now,” he reported, pointing to the pair of visiplates at the end of the room.</p>
			<p>Both of the ten-foot-square plates were activated. One was a solid luminous white; on the other was the image of a boy of twelve or fourteen, seated at a big writing machine. Even allowing for the fact that the boy was in a hypnotic trance, there was an expression of idiocy on his loose-lipped, slack-jawed face, a pervading dullness.</p>
			<p>“One of our best sensitives,” a man with a beard, several places down the table on Dallona’s right, said. “You remember him, Dallona; he produced that communication from the discarnate Assassin, Sirzim. Normally, he’s a low-grade imbecile, but in trance-state he’s wonderful. And there can be no argument that the communications he produces originates in his own mind; he doesn’t have mind enough, of his own, to operate that machine.”</p>
			<p>Garnon of Roxor rose to his feet, the others rising with him. He unfastened a jewel from the front of his tunic and handed it to Dallona.</p>
			<p>“Here, my dear Lady Dallona; I want you to have this,” he said. “It’s been in the family of Roxor for six generations, but I know that you will appreciate and cherish it.” He twisted a heavy ring from his left hand and gave it to his son. He unstrapped his wrist watch and passed it across the table to the gray-clad upper-servant. He gave a pocket case, containing writing tools, slide rule and magnifier, to the bearded man on the other side of Dallona. “Something you can use, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh,” he said. Then he took a belt, with a knife and holstered pistol, from a servant who had brought it to him, and gave it to the man with the red badge. “And something for you, Dirzed. The pistol’s by Farnor of Yand, and the knife was forged and tempered on Luna.”</p>
			<p>The man with the winged-bullet badge took the weapons, exclaiming in appreciation. Then he removed his own belt and buckled on the gift.</p>
			<p>“The pistol’s fully loaded,” Garnon told him.</p>
			<p>Dirzed drew it and checked⁠—a man of his craft took no statement about weapons without verification⁠—then slipped it back into the holster.</p>
			<p>“Shall I use it?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“By all means; I’d had that in mind when I selected it for you.”</p>
			<p>Another man, to the left of Girzon, received a cigarette case and lighter. He and Garnon hooked fingers and clapped shoulders.</p>
			<p>“Our views haven’t been the same, Garnon,” he said, “but I’ve always valued your friendship. I’m sorry you’re doing this, now; I believe you’ll be disappointed.”</p>
			<p>Garnon chuckled. “Would you care to make a small wager on that, Nirzav?” he asked. “You know what I’m putting up. If I’m proven right, will you accept the Volitionalist theory as verified?”</p>
			<p>Nirzav chewed his mustache for a moment. “Yes, Garnon, I will.” He pointed toward the blankly white screen. “If we get anything conclusive on that, I’ll have no other choice.”</p>
			<p>“All right, friends,” Garnon said to those around him. “Will you walk with me to the end of the room?”</p>
			<p>Servants removed a section from the table in front of him, to allow him and a few others to pass through; the rest of the guests remained standing at the table, facing toward the inside of the room. Garnon’s son, Girzon, and the gray-mustached Nirzav of Shonna, walked on his left; Dallona of Hadron and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh on his right. The gray-clad upper-servant, and two or three ladies, and a nobleman with a small chin beard, and several others, joined them; of those who had sat close to Garnon, only the man in the black tunic with the scarlet badge hung back. He stood still, by the break in the table, watching Garnon of Roxor walk away from him. Then Dirzed the Assassin drew the pistol he had lately received as a gift, hefted it in his hand, thumbed off the safety, and aimed at the back of Garnon’s head.</p>
			<p>They had nearly reached the end of the room when the pistol cracked. Dallona of Hadron started, almost as though the bullet had crashed into her own body, then caught herself and kept on walking. She closed her eyes and laid a hand on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh’s arm for guidance, concentrating her mind upon a single question. The others went on as though Garnon of Roxor were still walking among them.</p>
			<p>“Look!” Harnosh of Hosh cried, pointing to the image in the visiplate ahead. “He’s under control!”</p>
			<p>They all stopped short, and Dirzed, holstering his pistol, hurried forward to join them. Behind, a couple of servants had approached with a stretcher and were gathering up the crumpled figure that had, a moment ago, been Garnon.</p>
			<p>A change had come over the boy at the writing machine. His eyes were still glazed with the stupor of the hypnotic trance, but the slack jaw had stiffened, and the loose mouth was compressed in a purposeful line. As they watched, his hands went out to the keyboard in front of him and began to move over it, and as they did, letters appeared on the white screen on the left.</p>
			<p><q>Garnon of Roxor, discarnate, communicating</q>, they read. The machine stopped for a moment, then began again. <q>To Dallona of Hadron: The question you asked, after I discarnated, was: What was the last book I read, before the feast? While waiting for my valet to prepare my bath, I read the first ten verses of the fourth Canto of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Splendor of Space</i>, by Larnov of Horka, in my bedroom. When the bath was ready, I marked the page with a strip of message tape, containing a message from the bailiff of my estate on the Shevva River, concerning a breakdown at the power plant, and laid the book on the ivory-inlaid table beside the big red chair.</q></p>
			<p>Harnosh of Hosh looked at Dallona inquiringly; she nodded.</p>
			<p>“I rejected the question I had in my mind, and substituted that one, after the shot,” she said.</p>
			<p>He turned quickly to the upper-servant. “Check on that, right away, Kirzon,” he directed.</p>
			<p>As the upper-servant hurried out, the writing machine started again.</p>
			<p>
				<q>And to my son, Girzon: I will not use your son, Garnon, as a reincarnation-vehicle; I will remain discarnate until he is grown and has a son of his own; if he has no male child, I will reincarnate in the first available male child of the family of Roxor, or of some family allied to us by marriage. In any case, I will communicate before reincarnating.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>To Nirzav of Shonna: Ten days ago, when I dined at your home, I took a small knife and cut three notches, two close together and one a little apart from the others, on the under side of the table. As I remember, I sat two places down on the left. If you find them, you will know that I have won that wager that I spoke of a few minutes ago.</q>
			</p>
			<p>“I’ll have my butler check on that, right away,” Nirzav said. His eyes were wide with amazement, and he had begun to sweat; a man does not casually watch the beliefs of a lifetime invalidated in a few moments.</p>
			<p><q>To Dirzed the Assassin</q>: the machine continued. <q>You have served me faithfully, in the last ten years, never more so than with the last shot you fired in my service. After you fired, the thought was in your mind that you would like to take service with the Lady Dallona of Hadron, whom you believe will need the protection of a member of the Society of Assassins. I advise you to do so, and I advise her to accept your offer. Her work, since she has come to Darsh, has not made her popular in some quarters. No doubt Nirzav of Shonna can bear me out on that.</q></p>
			<p>“I won’t betray things told me in confidence, or said at the Councils of the Statisticalists, but he’s right,” Nirzav said. “You need a good Assassin, and there are few better than Dirzed.”</p>
			<p><q>I see that this sensitive is growing weary</q>, the letters on the screen spelled out. <q>His body is not strong enough for prolonged communication. I bid you all farewell, for the time; I will communicate again. Good evening, my friends, and I thank you for your presence at the feast.</q></p>
			<p>The boy, on the other screen, slumped back in his chair, his face relaxing into its customary expression of vacancy.</p>
			<p>“Will you accept my offer of service, Lady Dallona?” Dirzed asked. “It’s as Garnon said; you’ve made enemies.”</p>
			<p>Dallona smiled at him. “I’ve not been too deep in my work to know that. I’m glad to accept your offer, Dirzed.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Nirzav of Shonna had already turned away from the group and was hurrying from the room, to call his home for confirmation on the notches made on the underside of his dining table. As he went out the door, he almost collided with the upper-servant, who was rushing in with a book in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Here it is,” the latter exclaimed, holding up the book. “Larnov’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Splendor of Space</i>, just where he said it would be. I had a couple of servants with me as witnesses; I can call them in now, if you wish.” He handed the book to Harnosh of Hosh. “See, a strip of message tape in it, at the tenth verse of the Fourth Canto.”</p>
			<p>Nirzav of Shonna reentered the room; he was chewing his mustache and muttering to himself. As he rejoined the group in front of the now dark visiplates, he raised his voice, addressing them all generally.</p>
			<p>“My butler found the notches, just as the communication described,” he said. “This settles it! Garnon, if you’re where you can hear me, you’ve won. I can’t believe in the Statisticalist doctrines after this, or in the political program based upon them. I’ll announce my change of attitude at the next meeting of the Executive Council, and resign my seat. I was elected by Statisticalist votes, and I cannot hold office as a Volitionalist.”</p>
			<p>“You’ll need a couple of Assassins, too,” the nobleman with the chin beard told him. “Your former colleagues and fellow-party-members are regrettably given to the forcible discarnation of those who differ with them.”</p>
			<p>“I’ve never employed personal Assassins before,” Nirzav replied, “but I think you’re right. As soon as I get home, I’ll call Assassins’ Hall and make the necessary arrangements.”</p>
			<p>“Better do it now,” Girzon of Roxor told him, lowering his voice. “There are over a hundred guests here, and I can’t vouch for all of them. The Statisticalists would be sure to have a spy planted among them. My father was one of their most dangerous opponents, when he was on the Council; they’ve always been afraid he’d come out of retirement and stand for reelection. They’d want to make sure he was really discarnate. And if that’s the case, you can be sure your change of attitude is known to old Mirzark of Bashad by this time. He won’t dare allow you to make a public renunciation of Statisticalism.” He turned to the other nobleman. “Prince Jirzyn, why don’t you call the Volitionist headquarters and have a couple of our Assassins sent here to escort Lord Nirzav home?”</p>
			<p>“I’ll do that immediately,” Jirzyn of Starpha said. “It’s as Lord Girzon says; we can be pretty sure there was a spy among the guests, and now that you’ve come over to our way of thinking, we’re responsible for your safety.”</p>
			<p>He left the room to make the necessary visiphone call. Dallona, accompanied by Dirzed, returned to her place at the table, where she was joined by Harnosh of Hosh and some of the others.</p>
			<p>“There’s no question about the results,” Harnosh was exulting. “I’ll grant that the boy might have picked up some of that stuff telepathically from the carnate minds present here; even from the mind of Garnon, before he was discarnated. But he could not have picked up enough data, in that way, to make a connected and coherent communication. It takes a sensitive with a powerful mind of his own to practice telesthesia, and that boy’s almost an idiot.” He turned to Dallona. “You asked a question, mentally, after Garnon was discarnate, and got an answer that could have been contained only in Garnon’s mind. I think it’s conclusive proof that the discarnate Garnon was fully conscious and communicating.”</p>
			<p>“Dirzed also asked a question, mentally, after the discarnation, and got an answer. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh, we can state positively that the surviving individuality is fully conscious in the discarnate state, is telepathically sensitive, and is capable of telepathic communication with other minds,” Dallona agreed. “And in view of our earlier work with memory-recalls, we’re justified in stating positively that the individual is capable of exercising choice in reincarnation vehicles.”</p>
			<p>“My father had been considering voluntary discarnation for a long time,” Girzon of Roxor said. “Ever since the discarnation of my mother. He deferred that step because he was unwilling to deprive the Volitionalist Party of his support. Now it would seem that he has done more to combat Statisticalism by discarnating than he ever did in his carnate existence.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know, Girzon,” Jirzyn of Starpha said, as he joined the group. “The Statisticalists will denounce the whole thing as a prearranged fraud. And if they can discarnate the Lady Dallona before she can record her testimony under truth hypnosis or on a lie detector, we’re no better off than we were before. Dirzed, you have a great responsibility in guarding the Lady Dallona; some extraordinary security precautions will be needed.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>In his office, in the First Level city of Dhergabar, Tortha Karf, Chief of Paratime Police, leaned forward in his chair to hold his lighter for his special assistant, Verkan Vall, then lit his own cigarette. He was a man of middle age⁠—his three hundredth birthday was only a decade or so off⁠—and he had begun to acquire a double chin and a bulge at his waistline. His hair, once black, had turned a uniform iron-gray and was beginning to thin in front.</p>
			<p>“What do you know about the Second Level Akor-Neb Sector, Vall?” he inquired. “Ever work in that paratime-area?”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall’s handsome features became even more immobile than usual as he mentally pronounced the verbal trigger symbols which should bring hypnotically acquired knowledge into his conscious mind. Then he shook his head.</p>
			<p>“Must be a singularly well-behaved sector, sir,” he said. “Or else we’ve been lucky, so far. I never was on an Akor-Neb operation; don’t even have a hypno-mech for that sector. All I know is from general reading.</p>
			<p>“Like all the Second Level, its timelines descend from the probability of one or more shiploads of colonists having come to Terra from Mars about seventy-five to a hundred thousand years ago, and then having been cut off from the home planet and forced to develop a civilization of their own here. The Akor-Neb civilization is of a fairly high culture-order, even for Second Level. An atomic-power, interplanetary culture; gravity-counteraction, direct conversion of nuclear energy to electrical power, that sort of thing. We buy fine synthetic plastics and fabrics from them.” He fingered the material of his smartly-cut green police uniform. “I think this cloth is Akor-Neb. We sell a lot of Venusian <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>-leaf; they smoke it, straight and mixed with tobacco. They have a single System-wide government, a single race, and a universal language. They’re a dark-brown race, which evolved in its present form about fifty thousand years ago; the present civilization is about ten thousand years old, developed out of the wreckage of several earlier civilizations which decayed or fell through wars, exhaustion of resources, et cetera. They have legends, maybe historical records, of their extraterrestrial origin.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf nodded. “Pretty good, for consciously acquired knowledge,” he commented. “Well, our luck’s run out, on that sector; we have troubles there, now. I want you to go iron them out. I know, you’ve been going pretty hard, lately⁠—that nighthound business, on the Fourth Level Europo-American Sector, wasn’t any picnic. But the fact is that a lot of my ordinary and deputy assistants have a little too much regard for the alleged sanctity of human life, and this is something that may need some pretty drastic action.”</p>
			<p>“Some of our people getting out of line?” Verkan Vall asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, the data isn’t too complete, but one of our people has run into trouble on that sector, and needs rescuing⁠—a psychic-science researcher, a young lady named Hadron Dalla. I believe you know her, don’t you?” Tortha Karf asked innocently.</p>
			<p>“Slightly,” Verkan Vall deadpanned. “I enjoyed a brief but rather hectic companionate-marriage with her, about twenty years ago. What sort of a jam’s little Dalla got herself into, now?”</p>
			<p>“Well, frankly, we don’t know. I hope she’s still alive, but I’m not unduly optimistic. It seems that about a year ago, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hadron transposed to the Second Level, to study alleged proof of reincarnation which the Akor-Neb people were reported to possess. She went to Gindrabar, on Venus, and transposed to the Second Paratime Level, to a station maintained by Outtime Import &amp; Export Trading Corporation⁠—a <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i> plantation just east of the High Ridge country. There she assumed an identity as the daughter of a planter, and took the name of Dallona of Hadron. Parenthetically, all Akor-Neb family-names are prepositional; family-names were originally place names. I believe that ancient Akor-Neb marital relations were too complicated to permit exact establishment of paternity. And all Akor-Neb men’s personal names have -<i xml:lang="x-akorneb">irz</i>- or -<i xml:lang="x-akorneb">arn</i>- inserted in the middle, and women’s names end in -<i xml:lang="x-akorneb">itra</i> or -<i xml:lang="x-akorneb">ona</i>. You could call yourself Virzal of Verkan, for instance.</p>
			<p>“Anyhow, she made the Second Level Venus-Terra trip on a regular passenger liner, and landed at the Akor-Neb city of Ghamma, on the upper Nile. There she established contact with the Outtime Trading Corporation representative, Zortan Brend, locally known as Brarnend of Zorda. He couldn’t call himself Brarnend of Zortan⁠—in the Akor-Neb language, <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zortan</i> is a particularly nasty dirty-word. Hadron Dalla spent a few weeks at his residence, briefing herself on local conditions. Then she went to the capital city, Darsh, in eastern Europe, and enrolled as a student at something called the Independent Institute for Reincarnation Research, having secured a letter of introduction to its director, a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh.</p>
			<p>“Almost at once, she began sending in reports to her home organization, the Rhogom Memorial Foundation of Psychic Science, here at Dhergabar, through Zortan Brend. The people there were wildly enthusiastic. I don’t have more than the average intelligent⁠—I hope⁠—layman’s knowledge of psychics, but <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Volzar Darv, the director of Rhogom Foundation, tells me that even in the present incomplete form, her reports have opened whole new horizons in the science. It seems that these Akor-Neb people have actually demonstrated, as a scientific fact, that the human individuality reincarnates after physical death⁠—that your personality, and mine, have existed, as such, for ages, and will exist for ages to come. More, they have means of recovering, from almost anybody, memories of past reincarnations.</p>
			<p>“Well, after about a month, the people at this Reincarnation Institute realized that this Dallona of Hadron wasn’t any ordinary student. She probably had trouble keeping down to the local level of psychic knowledge. So, as soon as she’d learned their techniques, she was allowed to undertake experimental work of her own. I imagine she let herself out on that; as soon as she’d mastered the standard Akor-Neb methods of recovering memories of past reincarnations, she began refining and developing them more than the local yokels had been able to do in the past thousand years. I can’t tell you just what she did, because I don’t know the subject, but she must have lit things up properly. She got quite a lot of local publicity; not only scientific journals, but general newscasts.</p>
			<p>“Then, four days ago, she disappeared, and her disappearance seems to have been coincident with an unsuccessful attempt on her life. We don’t know as much about this as we should; all we have is Zortan Brend’s account.</p>
			<p>“It seems that on the evening of her disappearance, she had been attending the voluntary discarnation feast⁠—suicide party⁠—of a prominent nobleman named Garnon of Roxor. Evidently when the Akor-Neb people get tired of their current reincarnation they invite in their friends, throw a big party, and then do themselves in in an atmosphere of general conviviality. Frequently they take poison or inhale lethal gas; this fellow had his personal trigger man shoot him through the head. Dalla was one of the guests of honor, along with this Harnosh of Hosh. They’d made rather elaborate preparations, and after the shooting they got a detailed and apparently authentic spirit-communication from the late Garnon. The voluntary discarnation was just a routine social event, it seems, but the communication caused quite an uproar, and rated top place on the System-wide newscasts, and started a storm of controversy.</p>
			<p>“After the shooting and the communication, Dalla took the officiating gun artist, one Dirzed, into her own service. This Dirzed was spoken of as a generally respected member of something called the Society of Assassins, and that’ll give you an idea of what things are like on that sector, and why I don’t want to send anybody who might develop trigger-finger cramp at the wrong moment. She and Dirzed left the home of the gentleman who had just had himself discarnated, presumably for Dalla’s apartment, about a hundred miles away. That’s the last that’s been heard of either of them.</p>
			<p>“This attempt on Dalla’s life occurred while the pre-mortem revels were still going on. She lived in a six-room apartment, with three servants, on one of the upper floors of a three-thousand-foot tower⁠—Akor-Neb cities are built vertically, with considerable interval between units⁠—and while she was at this feast, a package was delivered at the apartment, ostensibly from the Reincarnation Institute and made up to look as though it contained record tapes. One of the servants accepted it from a service employee of the apartments. The next morning, a little before noon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh called her on the visiphone and got no answer; he then called the apartment manager, who entered the apartment. He found all three of the servants dead, from a lethal-gas bomb which had exploded when one of them had opened this package. However, Hadron Dalla had never returned to the apartment, the night before.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Verkan Vall was sitting motionless, his face expressionless as he ran Tortha Karf’s narrative through the intricate semantic and psychological processes of the First Level mentality. The fact that Hadron Dalla had been a former wife of his had been relegated to one corner of his consciousness and contained there; it was not a fact that would, at the moment, contribute to the problem or to his treatment of it.</p>
			<p>“The package was delivered while she was at this suicide party,” he considered. “It must, therefore, have been sent by somebody who either did not know she would be out of the apartment, or who did not expect it to function until after her return. On the other hand, if her disappearance was due to hostile action, it was the work of somebody who knew she was at the feast and did not want her to reach her apartment again. This would seem to exclude the sender of the package bomb.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf nodded. He had reached that conclusion, himself.</p>
			<p>“Thus,” Verkan Vall continued, “if her disappearance was the work of an enemy, she must have two enemies, each working in ignorance of the other’s plans.”</p>
			<p>“What do you think she did to provoke such enmity?”</p>
			<p>“Well, of course, it just might be that Dalla’s normally complicated love-life had got a little more complicated than usual and short-circuited on her,” Verkan Vall said, out of the fullness of personal knowledge, “but I doubt that, at the moment. I would think that this affair has political implications.”</p>
			<p>“So?” Tortha Karf had not thought of politics as an explanation. He waited for Verkan Vall to elaborate.</p>
			<p>“Don’t you see, chief?” the special assistant asked. “We find a belief in reincarnation on many timelines, as a religious doctrine, but these people accept it as a scientific fact. Such acceptance would carry much more conviction; it would influence a people’s entire thinking. We see it reflected in their disregard for death⁠—suicide as a social function, this Society of Assassins, and the like. It would naturally color their political thinking, because politics is nothing but common action to secure more favorable living conditions, and to these people, the term ‘living conditions’ includes not only the present life, but also an indefinite number of future lives as well. I find this title, ‘Independent’ Institute, suggestive. Independent of what? Possibly of partisan affiliation.”</p>
			<p>“But wouldn’t these people be grateful to her for her new discoveries, which would enable them to plan their future reincarnations more intelligently?” Tortha Karf asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, chief!” Verkan Vall reproached. “You know better than that! How many times have our people got in trouble on other timelines because they divulged some useful scientific fact that conflicted with the locally revered nonsense? You show me ten men who cherish some religious doctrine or political ideology, and I’ll show you nine men whose minds are utterly impervious to any factual evidence which contradicts their beliefs, and who regard the producer of such evidence as a criminal who ought to be suppressed. For instance, on the Fourth Level Europo-American Sector, where I was just working, there is a political sect, the Communists, who, in the territory under their control, forbid the teaching of certain well-established facts of genetics and heredity, because those facts do not fit the world-picture demanded by their political doctrines. And on the same sector, a religious sect recently tried, in some sections successfully, to outlaw the teaching of evolution by natural selection.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf nodded. “I remember some stories my grandfather told me, about his narrow escapes from an organization called the Holy Inquisition, when he was a paratime trader on the Fourth Level, about four hundred years ago. I believe that thing’s still operating, on the Europo-American Sector, under the name of the <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">N.K.V.D.</abbr> So you think Dalla may have proven something that conflicted with local reincarnation theories, and somebody who had a vested interest in maintaining those theories is trying to stop her?”</p>
			<p>“You spoke of a controversy over the communication alleged to have originated with this voluntarily discarnated nobleman. That would suggest a difference of opinion on the manner of nature of reincarnation or the discarnate state. This difference may mark the dividing line between the different political parties. Now, to get to this Darsh place, do I have to go to Venus, as Dalla did?”</p>
			<p>“No. The Outtime Trading Corporation has transposition facilities at Ravvanan, on the Nile, which is spatially coexistent with the city of Ghamma on the Akor-Neb Sector, where Zortan Brend is. You transpose through there, and Zortan Brend will furnish you transportation to Darsh. It’ll take you about two days, here, getting your hypno-mech indoctrinations and having your skin pigmented, and your hair turned black. I’ll notify Zortan Brend at once that you’re coming through. Is there anything special you’ll want?”</p>
			<p>“Why, I’ll want an abstract of the reports Dalla sent back to Rhogom Foundation. It’s likely that there is some clue among them as to whom her discoveries may have antagonized. I’m going to be a Venusian <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>-planter, a friend of her father’s; I’ll want full hypno-mech indoctrination to enable me to play that part. And I’ll want to familiarize myself with Akor-Neb weapons and combat techniques. I think that will be all, chief.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The last of the tall city units of Ghamma were sliding out of sight as the ship passed over them⁠—shaft-like buildings that rose two or three thousand feet above the ground in clumps of three or four or six, one at each corner of the landing stages set in series between them. Each of these units stood in the middle of a wooded park some five miles square; no unit was much more or less than twenty miles from its nearest neighbor, and the land between was the uniform golden-brown of ripening grain, crisscrossed with the threads of irrigation canals and dotted here and there with sturdy farm-village buildings and tall, stack-like granaries. There were a few other ships in the air at the fifty-thousand-foot level, and below, swarms of small airboats darted back and forth on different levels, depending upon speed and direction. Far ahead, to the northeast, was the shimmer of the Red Sea and the hazy bulk of Asia Minor beyond.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall⁠—the Lord Virzal of Verkan, temporarily⁠—stood at the glass front of the observation deck, looking down. He was a different Verkan Vall from the man who had talked with Tortha Karf in the latter’s office, two days before. The First Level cosmeticists had worked miracles upon him with their art. His skin was a soft chocolate-brown, now; his hair was jet-black, and so were his eyes. And in his subconscious mind, instantly available to consciousness, was a vast body of knowledge about conditions on the Akor-Neb sector, as well as a complete command of the local language, all hypnotically acquired.</p>
			<p>He knew that he was looking down upon one of the minor provincial cities of a very respectably advanced civilization. A civilization which built its cities vertically, since it had learned to counteract gravitation. A civilization which still depended upon natural cereals for food, but one which had learned to make the most efficient use of its soil. The network of dams and irrigation canals which he saw was as good as anything on his own paratime level. The wide dispersal of buildings, he knew, was a heritage of a series of disastrous atomic wars of several thousand years before; the Akor-Neb people had come to love the wide inter-vistas of open country and forest, and had continued to scatter their buildings, even after the necessity had passed. But the slim, towering buildings could only have been reared by a people who had banished nationalism and, with it, the threat of total war. He contrasted them with the ground-hugging dome cities of the Khiftan civilization, only a few thousand parayears distant.</p>
			<p>Three men came out of the lounge behind him and joined him. One was, like himself, a disguised paratimer from the First Level⁠—the Outtime Export and Import man, Zortan Brend, here known as Brarnend of Zorda. The other two were Akor-Neb people, and both wore the black tunics and the winged-bullet badges of the Society of Assassins. Unlike Verkan Vall and Zortan Brend, who wore shoulder holsters under their short tunics, the Assassins openly displayed pistols and knives on their belts.</p>
			<p>“We heard that you were coming two days ago, Lord Virzal,” Zortan Brend said. “We delayed the takeoff of this ship, so that you could travel to Darsh as inconspicuously as possible. I also booked a suite for you at the Solar Hotel, at Darsh. And these are your Assassins⁠—Olirzon, and Marnik.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with them.</p>
			<p>“Virzal of Verkan,” he identified himself. “I am satisfied to entrust myself to you.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll do our best for you, Lord Virzal,” the older of the pair, Olirzon, said. He hesitated for a moment, then continued: “Understand, Lord Virzal, I only ask for information useful in serving and protecting you. But is this of the Lady Dallona a political matter?”</p>
			<p>“Not from our side,” Verkan Vall told him. “The Lady Dallona is a scientist, entirely nonpolitical. The Honorable Brarnend is a business man; he doesn’t meddle with politics as long as the politicians leave him alone. And I’m a planter on Venus; I have enough troubles, with the natives, and the weather, and blue-rot in the <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i> plants, and poison roaches, and javelin bugs, without getting into politics. But psychic science is inextricably mixed with politics, and the Lady Dallona’s work had evidently tended to discredit the theory of Statistical Reincarnation.”</p>
			<p>“Do you often make understatements like that, Lord Virzal?” Olirzon grinned. “In the last six months, she’s knocked Statistical Reincarnation to splinters.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m not a psychic scientist, and as I said, I don’t know much about Terran politics,” Verkan Vall replied. “I know that the Statisticalists favor complete socialization and political control of the whole economy, because they want everybody to have the same opportunities in every reincarnation. And the Volitionalists believe that everybody reincarnates as he pleases, and so they favor continuance of the present system of private ownership of wealth and private profit under a system of free competition. And that’s about all I do know. Naturally, as a landowner and the holder of a title of nobility, I’m a Volitionalist in politics, but the socialization issue isn’t important on Venus. There is still too much unseated land there, and too many personal opportunities, to make socialism attractive to anybody.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s about it,” Zortan Brend told him. “I’m not enough of a psychicist to know what the Lady Dallona’s been doing, but she’s knocked the theoretical basis from under Statistical Reincarnation, and that’s the basis, in turn, of Statistical Socialism. I think we’ll find that the Statisticalist Party is responsible for whatever happened to her.”</p>
			<p>Marnik, the younger of the two Assassins, hesitated for a moment, then addressed Verkan Vall:</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal, I know none of the personalities involved in this matter, and I speak without wishing to give offense, but is it not possible that the Lady Dallona and the Assassin Dirzed may have gone somewhere together voluntarily? I have met Dirzed, and he has many qualities which women find attractive, and he is by no means indifferent to the opposite sex. You understand, Lord Virzal⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I understand all too perfectly, Marnik,” Verkan Vall replied, out of the fullness of experience. “The Lady Dallona has had affairs with a number of men, myself among them. But under the circumstances, I find that explanation unthinkable.”</p>
			<p>Marnik looked at him in open skepticism. Evidently, in his book, where an attractive man and a beautiful woman were concerned, that explanation was never unthinkable.</p>
			<p>“The Lady Dallona is a scientist,” Verkan Vall elaborated. “She is not above diverting herself with love affairs, but that’s all they are⁠—a not too important form of diversion. And, if you recall, she had just participated in a most significant experiment: you can be sure that she had other things on her mind at the time than pleasure jaunts with good-looking Assassins.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The ship was passing around the Caucasus Mountains, with the Caspian Sea in sight ahead, when several of the crew appeared on the observation deck and began preparing the shielding to protect the deck from gunfire. Zortan Brend inquired of the petty officer in charge of the work as to the necessity.</p>
			<p>“We’ve been getting reports of trouble at Darsh, sir,” the man said. “Newscast bulletins every couple of minutes: rioting in different parts of the city. Started yesterday afternoon, when a couple of Statisticalist members of the Executive Council resigned and went over to the Volitionalists. Lord Nirzav of Shonna, the only nobleman of any importance in the Statisticalist Party, was one of them; he was shot immediately afterward, while leaving the Council Chambers, along with a couple of Assassins who were with him. Some people in an airboat sprayed them with a machine rifle as they came out onto the landing stage.”</p>
			<p>The two Assassins exclaimed in horrified anger over this.</p>
			<p>“That wasn’t the work of members of the Society of Assassins!” Olirzon declared. “Even after he’d resigned, the Lord Nirzav was still immune till he left the Government Building. There’s too blasted much illegal assassination going on!”</p>
			<p>“What happened next?” Verkan Vall wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“About what you’d expect, sir. The Volitionalists weren’t going to take that quietly. In the past eighteen hours, four prominent Statisticalists were forcibly discarnated, and there was even a fight in Mirzark of Bashad’s house, when Volitionalist Assassins broke in; three of them and four of Mirzark’s Assassins were discarnated.”</p>
			<p>“You know, something is going to have to be done about that, too,” Olirzon said to Marnik. “It’s getting to a point where these political faction fights are being carried on entirely between members of the Society. In Ghamma alone, last year, thirty or forty of our members were discarnated that way.”</p>
			<p>“Plug in a newscast visiplate, Karnil,” Zortan Brend told the petty officer. “Let’s see what’s going on in Darsh now.”</p>
			<p>In Darsh, it seemed, an uneasy peace was being established. Verkan Vall watched heavily-armed airboats and light combat ships patrolling among the high towers of the city. He saw a couple of minor riots being broken up by the blue-uniformed Constabulary, with considerable shooting and a ruthless disregard for who might get shot. It wasn’t exactly the sort of policing that would have been tolerated in the First Level Civil Order Section, but it seemed to suit Akor-Neb conditions. And he listened to a series of angry recriminations and contradictory statements by different politicians, all of whom blamed the disorders on their opponents. The Volitionalists spoke of the Statisticalists as “insane criminals” and “underminers of social stability,” and the Statisticalists called the Volitionalists “reactionary criminals” and “enemies of social progress.” Politicians, he had observed, differed little in their vocabularies from one timeline to another.</p>
			<p>This kept up all the while the ship was passing over the Caspian Sea; as they were turning up the Volga valley, one of the ship’s officers came down from the control deck, above.</p>
			<p>“We’re coming into Darsh, now,” he said, and as Verkan Vall turned from the visiplate to the forward windows, he could see the white and pastel-tinted towers of the city rising above the hardwood forests that covered the whole Volga basin on this sector. “Your luggage has been put into the airboat, Lord Virzal and Honorable Assassins, and it’s ready for launching whenever you are.” The officer glanced at his watch. “We dock at Commercial Center in twenty minutes; we’ll be passing the Solar Hotel in ten.”</p>
			<p>They all rose, and Verkan Vall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with Zortan Brend.</p>
			<p>“Good luck, Lord Virzal,” the latter said. “I hope you find the Lady Dallona safe and carnate. If you need help, I’ll be at Mercantile House for the next day or so; if you get back to Ghamma before I do, you know who to ask for there.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A number of assassins loitered in the hallways and offices of the Independent Institute of Reincarnation Research when Verkan Vall, accompanied by Marnik, called there that afternoon. Some of them carried submachine-guns or sleep-gas projectors, and they were stopping people and questioning them. Marnik needed only to give them a quick gesture and the words, “Assassins’ Truce,” and he and his client were allowed to pass. They entered a lifter tube and floated up to the office of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh, with whom Verkan Vall had made an appointment.</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry, Lord Virzal,” the director of the Institute told him, “but I have no idea what has befallen the Lady Dallona, or even if she is still carnate. I am quite worried; I admired her extremely, both as an individual and as a scientist. I do hope she hasn’t been discarnated; that would be a serious blow to science. It is fortunate that she accomplished as much as she did, while she was with us.”</p>
			<p>“You think she is no longer carnate, then?”</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid so. The political effects of her discoveries⁠—” Harnosh of Hosh shrugged sadly. “She was devoted, to a rare degree, to her work. I am sure that nothing but her discarnation could have taken her away from us, at this time, with so many important experiments still uncompleted.”</p>
			<p>Marnik nodded to Verkan Vall, as much as to say: “You were right.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I intend acting upon the assumption that she is still carnate and in need of help, until I am positive to the contrary,” Verkan Vall said. “And in the latter case, I intend finding out who discarnated her, and send him to apologize for it in person. People don’t forcibly discarnate my friends with impunity.”</p>
			<p>“Sound attitude,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh commented. “There’s certainly no positive evidence that she isn’t still carnate. I’ll gladly give you all the assistance I can, if you’ll only tell me what you want.”</p>
			<p>“Well, in the first place,” Verkan Vall began, “just what sort of work was she doing?” He already knew the answer to that, from the reports she had sent back to the First Level, but he wanted to hear <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh’s version. “And what, exactly, are the political effects you mentioned? Understand, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh, I am really quite ignorant of any scientific subject unrelated to <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i> culture, and equally so of Terran politics. Politics, on Venus, is mainly a question of who gets how much graft out of what.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh smiled; evidently he had heard about Venusian politics. “Ah, yes, of course. But you are familiar with the main differences between Statistical and Volitional reincarnation theories?”</p>
			<p>“In a general way. The Volitionalists hold that the discarnate individuality is fully conscious, and is capable of something analogous to sense-perception, and is also capable of exercising choice in the matter of reincarnation vehicles, and can reincarnate or remain in the discarnate state as it chooses. They also believe that discarnate individualities can communicate with one another, and with at least some carnate individualities, by telepathy,” he said. “The Statisticalists deny all this; their opinion is that the discarnate individuality is in a more or less somnambulistic state, that it is drawn by a process akin to tropism to the nearest available reincarnation vehicle, and that it must reincarnate in and only in that vehicle. They are labeled Statisticalists because they believe that the process of reincarnation is purely at random, or governed by unknown and uncontrollable causes, and is unpredictable except as to aggregates.”</p>
			<p>“That’s a fairly good generalized summary,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh grudged, unwilling to give a mere layman too much credit. He dipped a spoon into a tobacco humidor, dusted the tobacco lightly with dried <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>, and rammed it into his pipe. “You must understand that our modern Statisticalists are the intellectual heirs of those ancient materialistic thinkers who denied the possibility of any discarnate existence, or of any extraphysical mind, or even of extrasensory perception. Since all these things have been demonstrated to be facts, the materialistic dogma has been broadened to include them, but always strictly within the frame of materialism.</p>
			<p>“We have proven, for instance, that the human individuality can exist in a discarnate state, and that it reincarnates into the body of an infant, shortly after birth. But the Statisticalists cannot accept the idea of discarnate consciousness, since they conceive of consciousness purely as a function of the physical brain. So they postulate an unconscious discarnate personality, or, as you put it, one in a somnambulistic state. They have to concede memory to this discarnate personality, since it was by recovery of memories of previous reincarnations that discarnate existence and reincarnation were proven to be facts. So they picture the discarnate individuality as a material object, or physical event, of negligible but actual mass, in which an indefinite number of memories can be stored as electronic charges. And they picture it as being drawn irresistibly to the body of the nearest non-incarnated infant. Curiously enough, the reincarnation vehicle chosen is almost always of the same sex as the vehicle of the previous reincarnation, the exceptions being cases of persons who had a previous history of psychological sex-inversion.”</p>
			<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh remembered the unlighted pipe in his hand, thrust it into his mouth, and lit it. For a moment, he sat with it jutting out of his black beard, until it was drawing to his satisfaction. “This belief in immediate reincarnation leads the Statisticalists, when they fight duels or perform voluntary discarnation, to do so in the neighborhood of maternity hospitals,” he added. “I know, personally, of one reincarnation memory-recall, in which the subject, a Statisticalist, voluntarily discarnated by lethal-gas inhaler in a private room at one of our local maternity hospitals, and reincarnated twenty years later in the city of Jeddul, three thousand miles away.” The square black beard jiggled as the scientist laughed.</p>
			<p>“Now, as to the political implications of these contradictory theories: Since the Statisticalists believe that they will reincarnate entirely at random, their aim is to create an utterly classless social and economic order, in which, theoretically, each individuality will reincarnate into a condition of equality with everybody else. Their political program, therefore, is one of complete socialization of all means of production and distribution, abolition of hereditary titles and inherited wealth⁠—eventually, all private wealth⁠—and total government control of all economic, social and cultural activities. Of course,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh apologized, “politics isn’t my subject; I wouldn’t presume to judge how that would function in practice.”</p>
			<p>“I would,” Verkan Vall said shortly, thinking of all the different timelines on which he had seen systems like that in operation. “You wouldn’t like it, doctor. And the Volitionalists?”</p>
			<p>“Well, since they believe that they are able to choose the circumstances of their next reincarnations for themselves, they are the party of the status quo. Naturally, almost all the nobles, almost all the wealthy trading and manufacturing families, and almost all professional people, are Volitionalists; most of the workers and peasants are Statisticalists. Or, at least, they were, for the most part, before we began announcing the results of the Lady Dallona’s experimental work.”</p>
			<p>“Ah; now we come to it,” Verkan Vall said as the story clarified.</p>
			<p>“Yes. In somewhat oversimplified form, the situation is rather like this,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh said. “The Lady Dallona introduced a number of refinements and some outright innovations into our technique of recovering memories of past reincarnations. Previously, it was necessary to keep the subject in an hypnotic trance, during which he or she would narrate what was remembered of past reincarnations, and this would be recorded. On emerging from the trance, the subject would remember nothing; the tape-recording would be all that would be left. But the Lady Dallona devised a technique by which these memories would remain in what might be called the fore part of the subject’s subconscious mind, so that they could be brought to the level of consciousness at will. More, she was able to recover memories of past discarnate existences, something we had never been able to do heretofore.” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh shook his head. “And to think, when I first met her, I thought that she was just another sensation-seeking young lady of wealth, and was almost about to refuse her enrollment!”</p>
			<p>He wasn’t the only one whom little Dalla had surprised, Verkan Vall thought. At least, he had been pleasantly surprised.</p>
			<p>“You see, this entirely disproves the Statistical Theory of Reincarnation. For example, we got a fine set of memory-recalls from one subject, for four previous reincarnations and four inter-carnations. In the first of these, the subject had been a peasant on the estate of a wealthy noble. Unlike most of his fellows, who reincarnated into other peasant families almost immediately after discarnation, this man waited for fifty years in the discarnate state for an opportunity to reincarnate as the son of an over-servant. In his next reincarnation, he was the son of a technician, and received a technical education; he became a physics researcher. For his next reincarnation, he chose the son of a nobleman by a concubine as his vehicle; in his present reincarnation, he is a member of a wealthy manufacturing family, and married into a family of the nobility. In five reincarnations, he has climbed from the lowest to the next-to-highest rung of the social ladder. Few individuals of the class from whence he began this ascent possess so much persistence or determination. Then, of course, there was the case of Lord Garnon of Roxor.”</p>
			<p>He went on to describe the last experiment in which Hadron Dalla had participated.</p>
			<p>“Well, that all sounds pretty conclusive,” Verkan Vall commented. “I take it the leaders of the Volitionalist Party here are pleased with the result of the Lady Dallona’s work?”</p>
			<p>“Pleased? My dear Lord Virzal, they’re fairly bursting with glee over it!” Harnosh of Hosh declared. “As I pointed out, the Statisticalist program of socialization is based entirely on the proposition that no one can choose the circumstances of his next reincarnation, and that’s been demonstrated to be utter nonsense. Until the Lady Dallona’s discoveries were announced, they were the dominant party, controlling a majority of the seats in Parliament and on the Executive Council. Only the Constitution kept them from enacting their entire socialization program long ago, and they were about to legislate constitutional changes which would remove that barrier. They had expected to be able to do so after the forthcoming general elections. But now, social inequality has become desirable: it gives people something to look forward to in the next reincarnation. Instead of wanting to abolish wealth and privilege and nobility, the proletariat want to reincarnate into them.” Harnosh of Hosh laughed happily. “So you can see how furious the Statisticalist Party organization is!”</p>
			<p>“There’s a catch to this, somewhere,” Marnik the Assassin, speaking for the first time, declared. “They can’t all reincarnate as princes, there aren’t enough vacancies to go ’round. And no noble is going to reincarnate as a tractor driver to make room for a tractor driver who wants to reincarnate as a noble.”</p>
			<p>“That’s correct,” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh replied. “There is a catch to it; a catch most people would never admit, even to themselves. Very few individuals possess the will power, the intelligence or the capacity for mental effort displayed by the subject of the case I just quoted. The average man’s interests are almost entirely on the physical side; he actually finds mental effort painful, and makes as little of it as possible. And that is the only sort of effort a discarnate individuality can exert. So, unable to endure the fifty or so years needed to make a really good reincarnation, he reincarnates in a year or so, out of pure boredom, into the first vehicle he can find, usually one nobody else wants.” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh dug out the heel of his pipe and blew through the stem. “But nobody will admit his own mental inferiority, even to himself. Now, every machine operator and field hand on the planet thinks he can reincarnate as a prince or a millionaire. Politics isn’t my subject, but I’m willing to bet that since Statistical Reincarnation is an exploded psychic theory, Statisticalist Socialism has been caught in the blast area and destroyed along with it.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Olirzon was in the drawing room of the hotel suite when they returned, sitting on the middle of his spinal column in a reclining chair, smoking a pipe, dressing the edge of his knife with a pocket-hone, and gazing lecherously at a young woman in the visiplate. She was an extremely well-designed young woman, in a rather fragmentary costume, and she was heaving her bosom at the invisible audience in anger, sorrow, scorn, entreaty, and numerous other emotions.</p>
			<p>“… this revolting crime,” she was declaiming, in a husky contralto, as Verkan Vall and Marnik entered, “foul even for the criminal beasts who conceived and perpetrated it!” She pointed an accusing finger. “This murder of the beautiful Lady Dallona of Hadron!”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall stopped short, considering the possibility of something having been discovered lately of which he was ignorant. Olirzon must have guessed his thought; he grinned reassuringly.</p>
			<p>“Think nothing of it, Lord Virzal,” he said, waving his knife at the visiplate. “Just political propaganda; strictly for the sparrows. Nice propagandist, though.”</p>
			<p>“And now,” the woman with the magnificent natural resources lowered her voice reverently, “we bring you the last image of the Lady Dallona, and of Dirzed, her faithful Assassin, taken just before they vanished, never to be seen again.”</p>
			<p>The plate darkened, and there were strains of slow, dirgelike music; then it lighted again, presenting a view of a broad hallway, thronged with men and women in bright varicolored costumes. In the foreground, wearing a tight skirt of deep blue and a short red jacket, was Hadron Dalla, just as she had looked in the solidographs taken in Dhergabar after her alteration by the First Level cosmeticians to conform to the appearance of the Malayoid Akor-Neb people. She was holding the arm of a man who wore the black tunic and red badge of an Assassin, a handsome specimen of the Akor-Neb race. Trust little Dalla for that, Verkan Vall thought. The figures were moving with exaggerated slowness, as though a very fleeting picture were being stretched out as far as possible. Having already memorized his former wife’s changed appearance, Verkan Vall concentrated on the man beside her until the picture faded.</p>
			<p>“All right, Olirzon; what did you get?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, first of all, at Assassins’ Hall,” Olirzon said, rolling up his left sleeve, holding his bare forearm to the light, and shaving a few fine hairs from it to test the edge of his knife. “Of course, they never tell one Assassin anything about the client of another Assassin; that’s standard practice. But I was in the Lodge Secretary’s office, where nobody but Assassins are ever admitted. They have a big panel in there, with the names of all the Lodge members on it in light-letters; that’s standard in all Lodges. If an Assassin is unattached and free to accept a client, his name’s in white light. If he has a client, the light’s changed to blue, and the name of the client goes up under his. If his whereabouts are unknown, the light’s changed to amber. If he is discarnated, his name’s removed entirely, unless the circumstances of his discarnation are such as to constitute an injury to the Society. In that case, the name’s in red light until he’s been properly avenged, or, as we say, till his blood’s been mopped up. Well, the name of Dirzed is up in blue light, with the name of Dallona of Hadron under it. I found out that the light had been amber for two days after the disappearance, and then had been changed back to blue. Get it, Lord Virzal?”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded. “I think so. I’d been considering that as a possibility from the first. Then what?”</p>
			<p>“Then I was about and around for a couple of hours, buying drinks for people⁠—unattached Assassins, Constabulary detectives, political workers, newscast people. You owe me fifteen System Monetary Units for that, Lord Virzal. What I got, when it’s all sorted out⁠—I taped it in detail, as soon as I got back⁠—reduces to this: The Volitionalists are moving mountains to find out who was the spy at Garnon of Roxor’s discarnation feast, but are doing nothing but nothing at all to find the Lady Dallona or Dirzed. The Statisticalists are making all sorts of secret efforts to find out what happened to her. The Constabulary blame the Statistos for the package bomb: they’re interested in that because of the discarnation of the three servants by an illegal weapon of indiscriminate effect. They claim that the disappearance of Dirzed and the Lady Dallona was a publicity hoax. The Volitionalists are preparing a line of publicity to deny this.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded. “That ties in with what you learned at Assassins’ Hall,” he said. “They’re hiding out somewhere. Is there any chance of reaching Dirzed through the Society of Assassins?”</p>
			<p>Olirzon shook his head. “If you’re right⁠—and that’s the way it looks to me, too⁠—he’s probably just called in and notified the Society that he’s still carnate and so is the Lady Dallona, and called off any search the Society might be making for him.”</p>
			<p>“And I’ve got to find the Lady Dallona as soon as I can. Well, if I can’t reach her, maybe I can get her to send word to me,” Verkan Vall said. “That’s going to take some doing, too.”</p>
			<p>“What did you find out, Lord Virzal?” Olirzon asked. He had a piece of soft leather, now, and was polishing his blade lovingly.</p>
			<p>“The Reincarnation Research people don’t know anything,” Verkan Vall replied. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh thinks she’s discarnate. I did find out that the experimental work she’s done, so far, has absolutely disproved the theory of Statistical Reincarnation. The Volitionalists’ theory is solidly established.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, what do you think, Olirzon?” Marnik added. “They have a case on record of a man who worked up from field hand to millionaire in five reincarnations. Deliberately, that is.” He went on to repeat what Harnosh of Hosh had said; he must have possessed an almost eidetic memory, for he gave the bearded psychicist’s words verbatim, and threw in the gestures and voice-inflections.</p>
			<p>Olirzon grinned. “You know, there’s a chance for the easy-money boys,” he considered. “ ‘You, too, can Reincarnate as a millionaire! Let <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Nirzutz of Futzbutz Help You! Only 49.98 System Monetary Units for the Secret, Infallible, Autosuggestive Formula.’ And would it sell!” He put away the hone and the bit of leather and slipped his knife back into its sheath. “If I weren’t a respectable Assassin, I’d give it a try, myself.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall looked at his watch. “We’d better get something to eat,” he said. “We’ll go down to the main dining room; the Martian Room, I think they call it. I’ve got to think of some way to let the Lady Dallona know I’m looking for her.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Martian Room, fifteen stories down, was a big place, occupying almost half of the floor space of one corner tower. It had been fitted to resemble one of the ruined buildings of the ancient and vanished race of Mars who were the ancestors of Terran humanity. One whole side of the room was a gigantic cine-solidograph screen, on which the gullied desolation of a Martian landscape was projected; in the course of about two hours, the scene changed from sunrise through daylight and night to sunrise again.</p>
			<p>It was high noon when they entered and found a table; by the time they had finished their dinner, the night was ending and the first glow of dawn was tinting the distant hills. They sat for a while, watching the light grow stronger, then got up and left the table.</p>
			<p>There were five men at a table near them; they had come in before the stars had grown dim, and the waiters were just bringing their first dishes. Two were Assassins, and the other three were of a breed Verkan Vall had learned to recognize on any timeline⁠—the arrogant, cocksure, ambitious, leftist politician, who knows what is best for everybody better than anybody else does, and who is convinced that he is inescapably right and that whoever differs with him is not only an ignoramus but a venal scoundrel as well. One was a beefy man in a gold-laced cream-colored dress tunic; he had thick lips and a too-ready laugh. Another was a rather monkish-looking young man who spoke earnestly and rolled his eyes upward, as though at some celestial vision. The third had the faint powdering of gray in his black hair which was, among the Akor-Neb people, almost the only indication of advanced age.</p>
			<p>“Of course it is; the whole thing is a fraud,” the monkish young man was saying angrily. “But we can’t prove it.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Sirzob, here, can prove anything, if you give him time,” the beefy one laughed. “The trouble is, there isn’t too much time. We know that that communication was a fake, prearranged by the Volitionalists, with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh and this Dallona of Hadron as their tools. They fed the whole thing to that idiot boy hypnotically, in advance, and then, on a signal, he began typing out this spurious communication. And then, of course, Dallona and this Assassin of hers ran off somewhere together, so that we’d be blamed with discarnating or abducting them, and so that they wouldn’t be made to testify about the communication on a lie detector.”</p>
			<p>A sudden happy smile touched Verkan Vall’s eyes. He caught each of his Assassins by an arm.</p>
			<p>“Marnik, cover my back,” he ordered. “Olirzon, cover everybody at the table. Come on!”</p>
			<p>Then he stepped forward, halting between the chairs of the young man and the man with the gray hair and facing the beefy man in the light tunic.</p>
			<p>“You!” he barked. “I mean <strong>you</strong>.”</p>
			<p>The beefy man stopped laughing and stared at him; then sprang to his feet. His hand, streaking toward his left armpit, stopped and dropped to his side as Olirzon aimed a pistol at him. The others sat motionless.</p>
			<p>“You,” Verkan Vall continued, “are a complete, deliberate, malicious, and unmitigated liar. The Lady Dallona of Hadron is a scientist of integrity, incapable of falsifying her experimental work. What’s more, her father is one of my best friends; in his name, and in hers, I demand a full retraction of the slanderous statements you have just made.”</p>
			<p>“Do you know who I am?” the beefy one shouted.</p>
			<p>“I know <em>what</em> you are,” Verkan Vall shouted back. Like most ancient languages, the Akor-Neb speech included an elaborate, delicately-shaded, and utterly vile vocabulary of abuse; Verkan Vall culled from it judiciously and at length. “And if I don’t make myself understood verbally, we’ll go down to the object level,” he added, snatching a bowl of soup from in front of the monkish-looking young man and throwing it across the table.</p>
			<p>The soup was a dark brown, almost black. It contained bits of meat, and mushrooms, and slices of hard-boiled egg, and yellow Martian rock lichen. It produced, on the light tunic, a most spectacular effect.</p>
			<p>For a moment, Verkan Vall was afraid the fellow would have an apoplectic stroke, or an epileptic fit. Mastering himself, however, he bowed jerkily.</p>
			<p>“Marnark of Bashad,” he identified himself. “When and where can my friends consult yours?”</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal of Verkan,” the paratimer bowed back. “Your friends can negotiate with mine here and now. I am represented by these Gentlemen-Assassins.”</p>
			<p>“I won’t submit my friends to the indignity of negotiating with them,” Marnark retorted. “I insist that you be represented by persons of your own quality and mine.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, you do?” Olirzon broke in. “Well, is your objection personal to me, or to Assassins as a class? In the first case, I’ll remember to make a private project of you, as soon as I’m through with my present employment; if it’s the latter, I’ll report your attitude to the Society. I’ll see what Klarnood, our President-General, thinks of your views.”</p>
			<p>A crowd had begun to accumulate around the table. Some of them were persons in evening dress, some were Assassins on the hotel payroll, and some were unattached Assassins.</p>
			<p>“Well, you won’t have far to look for him,” one of the latter said, pushing through the crowd to the table.</p>
			<p>He was a man of middle age, inclined to stoutness; he made Verkan Vall think of a chocolate figure of Tortha Karf. The red badge on his breast was surrounded with gold lace, and, instead of black wings and a silver bullet, it bore silver wings and a golden dagger. He bowed contemptuously at Marnark of Bashad.</p>
			<p>“Klarnood, President-General of the Society of Assassins,” he announced. “Marnark of Bashad, did I hear you say that you considered members of the Society as unworthy to negotiate an affair of honor with your friends, on behalf of this nobleman who has been courteous enough to accept your challenge?” he demanded.</p>
			<p>Marnark of Bashad’s arrogance suffered considerable evaporation-loss. His tone became almost servile.</p>
			<p>“Not at all, Honorable Assassin-President,” he protested. “But as I was going to ask these gentlemen to represent me, I thought it would be more fitting for the other gentleman to be represented by personal friends, also. In that way⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Sorry, Marnark,” the gray-haired man at the table said. “I can’t second you; I have a quarrel with the Lord Virzal, too.” He rose and bowed. “Sirzob of Abo. Inasmuch as the Honorable Marnark is a guest at my table, an affront to him is an affront to me. In my quality as his host, I must demand satisfaction from you, Lord Virzal.”</p>
			<p>“Why, gladly, Honorable Sirzob,” Verkan Vall replied. This was getting better and better every moment. “Of course, your friend, the Honorable Marnark, enjoys priority of challenge; I’ll take care of you as soon as I have, shall we say, satisfied, him.”</p>
			<p>The earnest and rather consecrated-looking young man rose also, bowing to Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>“Yirzol of Narva. I, too, have a quarrel with you, Lord Virzal; I cannot submit to the indignity of having my food snatched from in front of me, as you just did. I also demand satisfaction.”</p>
			<p>“And quite rightly, Honorable Yirzol,” Verkan Vall approved. “It looks like such good soup, too,” he sorrowed, inspecting the front of Marnark’s tunic. “My seconds will negotiate with yours immediately; your satisfaction, of course, must come after that of Honorable Sirzob.”</p>
			<p>“If I may intrude,” Klarnood put in smoothly, “may I suggest that as the Lord Virzal is represented by his Assassins, yours can represent all three of you at the same time. I will gladly offer my own good offices as impartial supervisor.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall turned and bowed as to royalty. “An honor, Assassin-President: I am sure no one could act in that capacity more satisfactorily.”</p>
			<p>“Well, when would it be most convenient to arrange the details?” Klarnood inquired. “I am completely at your disposal, gentlemen.”</p>
			<p>“Why, here and now, while we’re all together,” Verkan Vall replied.</p>
			<p>“I object to that!” Marnark of Bashad vociferated. “We can’t make arrangements here; why, all these hotel people, from the manager down, are nothing but tipsters for the newscast services!”</p>
			<p>“Well, what’s wrong with that?” Verkan Vall demanded. “You knew that when you slandered the Lady Dallona in their hearing.”</p>
			<p>“The Lord Virzal of Verkan is correct,” Klarnood ruled. “And the offenses for which you have challenged him were also committed in public. By all means, let’s discuss the arrangements now.” He turned to Verkan Vall. “As the challenged party, you have the choice of weapons; your opponents, then, have the right to name the conditions under which they are to be used.”</p>
			<p>Marnark of Bashad raised another outcry over that. The assault upon him by the Lord Virzal of Verkan was deliberately provocative, and therefore tantamount to a challenge; he, himself, had the right to name the weapons. Klarnood upheld him.</p>
			<p>“Do the other gentlemen make the same claim?” Verkan Vall wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“If they do, I won’t allow it,” Klarnood replied. “You deliberately provoked Honorable Marnark, but the offenses of provoking him at Honorable Sirzob’s table, and of throwing Honorable Yirzol’s soup at him, were not given with intent to provoke. These gentlemen have a right to challenge, but not to consider themselves provoked.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I choose knives, then,” Marnark hastened to say.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall smiled thinly. He had learned knife-play among the greatest masters of that art in all paratime, the Third Level Khanga pirates of the Caribbean Islands.</p>
			<p>“And we fight barefoot, stripped to the waist, and without any parrying weapon in the left hand,” Verkan Vall stipulated.</p>
			<p>The beefy Marnark fairly licked his chops in anticipation. He outweighed Verkan Vall by forty pounds; he saw an easy victory ahead. Verkan Vall’s own confidence increased at these signs of his opponent’s assurance.</p>
			<p>“And as for Honorable Sirzob and Honorable Yirzol, I chose pistols,” he added.</p>
			<p>Sirzob and Yirzol held a hasty whispered conference.</p>
			<p>“Speaking both for Honorable Yirzol and for myself,” Sirzob announced, “we stipulate that the distance shall be twenty meters, that the pistols shall be fully loaded, and that fire shall be at will after the command.”</p>
			<p>“Twenty rounds, fire at will, at twenty meters!” Olirzon hooted. “You must think our principal’s as bad a shot as you are!”</p>
			<p>The four Assassins stepped aside and held a long discussion about something, with considerable argument and gesticulation. Klarnood, observing Verkan Vall’s impatience, leaned close to him and whispered:</p>
			<p>“This is highly irregular; we must pretend ignorance and be patient. They’re laying bets on the outcome. You must do your best, Lord Virzal; you don’t want your supporters to lose money.”</p>
			<p>He said it quite seriously, as though the outcome were otherwise a matter of indifference to Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>Marnark wanted to discuss time and place, and proposed that all three duels be fought at dawn, on the fourth landing stage of Darsh Central Hospital; that was closest to the maternity wards, and statistics showed that most births occurred just before that hour.</p>
			<p>“Certainly not,” Verkan Vall vetoed. “We’ll fight here and now; I don’t propose going a couple of hundred miles to meet you at any such unholy hour. We’ll fight in the nearest hallway that provides twenty meters’ shooting distance.”</p>
			<p>Marnark, Sirzob and Yirzol all clamored in protest. Verkan Vall shouted them down, drawing on his hypnotically acquired knowledge of Akor-Neb duelling customs. “The code explicitly states that satisfaction shall be rendered as promptly as possible, and I insist on a literal interpretation. I’m not going to inconvenience myself and Assassin-President Klarnood and these four Gentlemen-Assassins just to humor Statisticalist superstitions.”</p>
			<p>The manager of the hotel, drawn to the Martian Room by the uproar, offered a hallway connecting the kitchens with the refrigerator rooms; it was fifty meters long by five in width, was well-lighted and soundproof, and had a bay in which the seconds and other could stand during the firing.</p>
			<p>They repaired thither in a body, Klarnood gathering up several hotel servants on the way through the kitchen. Verkan Vall stripped to the waist, pulled off his ankle boots, and examined Olirzon’s knife. Its tapering eight-inch blade was double-edged at the point, and its handle was covered with black velvet to afford a good grip, and wound with gold wire. He nodded approvingly, gripped it with his index finger crooked around the cross-guard, and advanced to meet Marnark of Bashad.</p>
			<p>As he had expected, the burly politician was depending upon his greater brawn to overpower his antagonist. He advanced with a sidling, spread-legged gait, his knife hand against his right hip and his left hand extended in front. Verkan Vall nodded with pleased satisfaction; a wrist-grabber. Then he blinked. Why, the fellow was actually holding his knife reversed, his little finger to the guard and his thumb on the pommel!</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall went briskly to meet him, made a feint at his knife hand with his own left, and then sidestepped quickly to the right. As Marnark’s left hand grabbed at his right wrist, his left hand brushed against it and closed into a fist, with Marnark’s left thumb inside of it, He gave a quick downward twist with his wrist, pulling Marnark off balance.</p>
			<p>Caught by surprise, Marnark stumbled, his knife flailing wildly away from Verkan Vall. As he stumbled forward, Verkan Vall pivoted on his left heel and drove the point of his knife into the back of Marnark’s neck, twisting it as he jerked it free. At the same time, he released Marnark’s thumb. The politician continued his stumble and fell forward on his face, blood spurting from his neck. He gave a twitch or so, and was still.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall stooped and wiped the knife on the dead man’s clothes⁠—another Khanga pirate gesture⁠—and then returned it to Olirzon.</p>
			<p>“Nice weapon, Olirzon,” he said. “It fitted my hand as though I’d been born holding it.”</p>
			<p>“You used it as though you had, Lord Virzal,” the Assassin replied. “Only eight seconds from the time you closed with him.”</p>
			<p>The function of the hotel servants whom Klarnood had gathered up now became apparent; they advanced, took the body of Marnark by the heels, and dragged it out of the way. The others watched this removal with mixed emotions. The two remaining principals were impassive and frozen-faced. Their two Assassins, who had probably bet heavily on Marnark, were chagrined. And Klarnood was looking at Verkan Vall with a considerable accretion of respect. Verkan Vall pulled on his boots and resumed his clothing.</p>
			<p>There followed some argument about the pistols; it was finally decided that each combatant should use his own shoulder-holster weapon. All three were nearly enough alike⁠—small weapons, rather heavier than they looked, firing a tiny ten-grain bullet at ten thousand foot-seconds. On impact, such a bullet would almost disintegrate; a man hit anywhere in the body with one would be killed instantly, his nervous system paralyzed and his heart stopped by internal pressure. Each of the pistols carried twenty rounds in the magazine.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall and Sirzob of Abo took their places, their pistols lowered at their sides, facing each other across a measured twenty meters.</p>
			<p>“Are you ready, gentlemen?” Klarnood asked. “You will not raise your pistols until the command to fire; you may fire at will after it. Ready. <em>Fire!</em>”</p>
			<p>Both pistols swung up to level. Verkan Vall found Sirzob’s head in his sights and squeezed; the pistol kicked back in his hand, and he saw a lance of blue flame jump from the muzzle of Sirzob’s. Both weapons barked together, and with the double report came the whip-cracking sound of Sirzob’s bullet passing Verkan Vall’s head. Then Sirzob’s face altered its appearance unpleasantly, and he pitched forward. Verkan Vall thumbed on his safety and stood motionless, while the servants advanced, took Sirzob’s body by the heels, and dragged it over beside Marnark’s.</p>
			<p>“All right; Honorable Yirzol, you’re next,” Verkan Vall called out.</p>
			<p>“The Lord Virzal has fired one shot,” one of the opposing seconds objected, “and Honorable Yirzol has a full magazine. The Lord Virzal should put in another magazine.”</p>
			<p>“I grant him the advantage; let’s get on with it,” Verkan Vall said.</p>
			<p>Yirzol of Narva advanced to the firing point. He was not afraid of death⁠—none of the Akor-Neb people were; their language contained no word to express the concept of total and final extinction⁠—and discarnation by gunshot was almost entirely painless. But he was beginning to suspect that he had made a fool of himself by getting into this affair, he had work in his present reincarnation which he wanted to finish, and his political party would suffer loss, both of his services and of prestige.</p>
			<p>“Are you ready, gentlemen?” Klarnood intoned ritualistically. “You will not raise your pistols until the command to fire; you may fire at will after it. Ready, <em>Fire!</em>”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall shot Yirzol of Narva through the head before the latter had his pistol half raised. Yirzol fell forward on the splash of blood Sirzob had made, and the servants came forward and dragged his body over with the others. It reminded Verkan Vail of some sort of industrial assembly-line operation. He replaced the two expended rounds in his magazine with fresh ones and slid the pistol back into its holster. The two Assassins whose principals had been so expeditiously massacred were beginning to count up their losses and pay off the winners.</p>
			<p>Klarnood, the President-General of the Society of Assassins, came over, hooking fingers and clapping shoulders with Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal, I’ve seen quite a few duels, but nothing quite like that,” he said. “You should have been an Assassin!”</p>
			<p>That was a considerable compliment. Verkan Vall thanked him modestly.</p>
			<p>“I’d like to talk to you privately,” the Assassin-President continued. “I think it’ll be worth your while if we have a few words together.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded. “My suite is on the fifteenth floor above; will that be all right?” He waited until the losers had finished settling their bets, then motioned to his own pair of Assassins.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>As they emerged into the Martian Room again, the manager was waiting; he looked as though he were about to demand that Verkan Vall vacate his suite. However, when he saw the arm of the President-General of the Society of Assassins draped amicably over his guest’s shoulder, he came forward bowing and smiling.</p>
			<p>“Larnorm, I want you to put five of your best Assassins to guarding the approaches to the Lord Virzal’s suite,” Klarnood told him. “I’ll send five more from Assassins’ Hall to replace them at their ordinary duties. And I’ll hold you responsible with your carnate existence for the Lord Virzal’s safety in this hotel. Understand?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, Honorable Assassin-President; you may trust me. The Lord Virzal will be perfectly safe.”</p>
			<p>In Verkan Vall’s suite, above, Klarnood sat down and got out his pipe, filling it with tobacco lightly mixed with <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>. To his surprise, he saw his host light a plain tobacco cigarette.</p>
			<p>“Don’t you use <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Very little,” Verkan Vall replied. “I grow it. If you’d see the bums who hang around our drying sheds, on Venus, cadging rejected leaves and smoking themselves into a stupor, you’d be frugal in using it, too.”</p>
			<p>Klarnood nodded. “You know, most men would want a pipe of fifty percent, or a straight <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i> cigarette, after what you’ve been through,” he said.</p>
			<p>“I’d need something like that, to deaden my conscience, if I had one to deaden,” Verkan Vall said. “As it is, I feel like a murderer of babes. That overgrown fool, Marnark, handled his knife like a cow-butcher. The young fellow couldn’t handle a pistol at all. I suppose the old fellow, Sirzob, was a fair shot, but dropping him wasn’t any great feat of arms, either.”</p>
			<p>Klarnood looked at him curiously for a moment. “You know,” he said, at length, “I believe you actually mean that. Well, until he met you, Marnark of Bashad was rated as the best knife-fighter in Darsh. Sirzob had ten dueling victories to his credit, and young Yirzol four.” He puffed slowly on his pipe. “I like you, Lord Virzal; a great Assassin was lost when you decided to reincarnate as a Venusian landowner. I’d hate to see you discarnated without proper warning. I take it you’re ignorant of the intricacies of Terran politics?”</p>
			<p>“To a large extent, yes.”</p>
			<p>“Well, do you know who those three men were?” When Verkan Vall shook his head, Klarnood continued: “Marnark was the son and right-hand associate of old Mirzark of Bashad, the Statisticalist Party leader. Sirzob of Abo was their propaganda director. And Yirzol of Narva was their leading socioeconomic theorist, and their candidate for Executive Chairman. In six minutes, with one knife thrust and two shots, you did the Statisticalist Party an injury second only to that done them by the young lady in whose name you were fighting. In two weeks, there will be a planetwide general election. As it stands, the Statisticalists have a majority of the seats in Parliament and on the Executive Council. As a result of your work and the Lady Dallona’s, they’ll lose that majority, and more, when the votes are tallied.”</p>
			<p>“Is that another reason why you like me?” Verkan Vall asked.</p>
			<p>“Unofficially, yes. As President-General of the Society of Assassins, I must be nonpolitical. The Society is rigidly so; if we let ourselves become involved, as an organization, in politics, we could control the System Government inside of five years, and we’d be wiped out of existence in fifty years by the very forces we sought to control,” Klarnood said. “But personally, I would like to see the Statisticalist Party destroyed. If they succeed in their program of socialization, the Society would be finished. A socialist state is, in its final development, an absolute, total, state; no total state can tolerate extralegal and para-governmental organizations. So we have adopted the policy of giving a little inconspicuous aid, here and there, to people who are dangerous to the Statisticalists. The Lady Dallona of Hadron, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh, are such persons. You appear to be another. That’s why I ordered that fellow, Larnorm, to make sure you were safe in his hotel.”</p>
			<p>“Where is the Lady Dallona?” Verkan Vall asked. “From your use of the present tense, I assume you believe her to be still carnate.”</p>
			<p>Klarnood looked at Verkan Vall keenly. “That’s a pretty blunt question, Lord Virzal,” he said. “I wish I knew a little more about you. When you and your Assassins started inquiring about the Lady Dallona, I tried to check up on you. I found out that you had come to Darsh from Ghamma on a ship of the family of Zorda, accompanied by Brarnend of Zorda himself. And that’s all I could find out. You claim to be a Venusian planter, and you might be. Any Terran who can handle weapons as you can would have come to my notice long ago. But you have no more ascertainable history than if you’d stepped out of another dimension.”</p>
			<p>That was getting uncomfortably close to the truth. In fact, it <em>was</em> the truth. Verkan Vall laughed.</p>
			<p>“Well, confidentially,” he said, “I’m from the Arcturus System. I followed the Lady Dallona here from our home planet, and when I have rescued her from among you Solarians, I shall, according to our customs, receive her hand in marriage. As she is the daughter of the Emperor of Arcturus, that’ll be quite a good thing for me.”</p>
			<p>Klarnood chuckled. “You know, you’d only have to tell me that about three or four times and I’d start believing it,” he said. “And <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh would believe it the first time; he’s been talking to himself ever since the Lady Dallona started her experimental work here. Lord Virzal, I’m going to take a chance on you. The Lady Dallona is still carnate, or was four days ago, and the same for Dirzed. They both went into hiding after the discarnation feast of Garnon of Roxor, to escape the enmity of the Statisticalists. Two days after they disappeared, Dirzed called Assassins’ Hall and reported this, but told us nothing more. I suppose, in about three or four days, I could reestablish contact with him. We want the public to think that the Statisticalists made away with the Lady Dallona, at least until the election’s over.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded. “I was pretty sure that was the situation,” he said. “It may be that they will get in touch with me; if they don’t, I’ll need your help in reaching them.”</p>
			<p>“Why do you think the Lady Dallona will try to reach you?”</p>
			<p>“She needs all the help she can get. She knows she can get plenty from me. Why do you think I interrupted my search for her, and risked my carnate existence, to fight those people over a matter of verbalisms and political propaganda?” Verkan Vall went to the newscast visiplate and snapped it on. “We’ll see if I’m getting results, yet.”</p>
			<p>The plate lighted, and a handsome young man in a gold-laced green suit was speaking out of it:</p>
			<p>“… where he is heavily guarded by Assassins. However, in an exclusive interview with representatives of this service, the Assassin Hirzif, one of the two who seconded the men the Lord Virzal fought, said that in his opinion all of the three were so outclassed as to have had no chance whatever, and that he had already refused an offer of ten thousand System Monetary Units to discarnate the Lord Virzal for the Statisticalist Party. ‘When I want to discarnate,’ Hirzif the Assassin said, ‘I’ll invite in my friends and do it properly; until I do, I wouldn’t go up against the Lord Virzal of Verkan for ten million <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">S.M.U.</abbr>’ ”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall snapped off the visiplate. “See what I mean?” he asked. “I fought those politicians just for the advertising. If Dallona and Dirzed are anywhere near a visiplate, they’ll know how to reach me.”</p>
			<p>“Hirzif shouldn’t have talked about refusing that retainer,” Klarnood frowned. “That isn’t good Assassin ethics. Why, yes, Lord Virzal; that was cleverly planned. It ought to get results. But I wish you’d get the Lady Dallona out of Darsh, and preferably off Terra, as soon as you can. We’ve benefited by this, so far, but I shouldn’t like to see things go much further. A real civil war could develop out of this situation, and I don’t want that. Call on me for help; I’ll give you a code word to use at Assassins’ Hall.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A real civil war was developing even as Klarnood spoke; by midmorning of the next day, the fighting that had been partially suppressed by the Constabulary had broken out anew. The Assassins employed by the Solar Hotel⁠—heavily reinforced during the night⁠—had fought a pitched battle with Statisticalist partisans on the landing stage above Verkan Vall’s suite, and now several Constabulary airboats were patrolling around the building. The rule on Constabulary interference seemed to be that while individuals had an unquestionable right to shoot out their differences among themselves, any fighting likely to endanger nonparticipants was taboo.</p>
			<p>Just how successful in enforcing this rule the Constabulary were was open to some doubt. Ever since arising, Verkan Vall had heard the crash of small arms and the hammering of automatic weapons in other parts of the towering city unit. There hadn’t been a civil war on the Akor-Neb Sector for over five centuries, he knew, but then, Hadron Dalla, Doctor of Psychic Science, and intertemporal trouble-carrier extraordinary, had only been on this sector for a little under a year. If anything, he was surprised that the explosion had taken so long to occur.</p>
			<p>One of the servants furnished to him by the hotel management approached him in the drawing room, holding a four-inch-square wafer of white plastic.</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal, there is a masked Assassin in the hallway who brought this under Assassins’ Truce,” he said.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall took the wafer and pared off three of the four edges, which showed black where they had been fused. Unfolding it, he found, as he had expected, that the pyrographed message within was in the alphabet and language of the First Paratime Level:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:letter">
				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Vall, darling:</p>
				<p>Am I glad you got here; this time I really <em>am</em> in the middle, but good! The Assassin, Dirzed, who brings this, is in my service. You can trust him implicitly; he’s about the only person in Darsh you can trust. He’ll bring you to where I am.</p>
				<footer role="presentation">
					<p epub:type="z3998:sender z3998:signature">Dalla</p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:postscript"><abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.S.</abbr> I hope you’re not still angry about that musician. I told you, at the time, that he was just helping me with an experiment in telepathy.</p>
					<p epub:type="z3998:signature">
						<abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr>
					</p>
				</footer>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Verkan Vall grinned at the postscript. That had been twenty years ago, when he’d been eighty and she’d been seventy. He supposed she’d expect him to take up his old relationship with her again. It probably wouldn’t last any longer than it had, the other time; he recalled a Fourth Level proverb about the leopard and his spots. It certainly wouldn’t be boring, though.</p>
			<p>“Tell the Assassin to come in,” he directed. Then he tossed the message down on a table. Outside of himself, nobody in Darsh could read it but the woman who had sent it; if, as he thought highly probable, the Statisticalists had spies among the hotel staff, it might serve to reduce some cryptanalyst to gibbering insanity.</p>
			<p>The Assassin entered, drawing off a cowl-like mask. He was the man whose arm Dalla had been holding in the visiplate picture; Verkan Vall even recognized the extremely ornate pistol and knife on his belt.</p>
			<p>“Dirzed the Assassin,” he named himself. “If you wish, we can visiphone Assassins’ Hall for verification of my identity.”</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal of Verkan. And my Assassins, Marnik and Olirzon.” They all hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with the newcomer. “That won’t be needed,” Verkan Vall told Dirzed. “I know you from seeing you with the Lady Dallona, on the visiplate; you’re ‘Dirzed, her faithful Assassin.’ ”</p>
			<p>Dirzed’s face, normally the color of a good walnut gunstock, turned almost black. He used shockingly bad language.</p>
			<p>“And that’s why I have to wear this abomination,” he finished, displaying the mask. “The Lady Dallona and I can’t show our faces anywhere; if we did, every Statisticalist and his six-year-old brat would know us, and we’d be fighting off an army of them in five minutes.”</p>
			<p>“Where’s the Lady Dallona, now?”</p>
			<p>“In hiding, Lord Virzal, at a private dwelling dome in the forest; she’s most anxious to see you. I’m to take you to her, and I would strongly advise that you bring your Assassins along. There are other people at this dome, and they are not personally loyal to the Lady Dallona. I’ve no reason to suspect them of secret enmity, but their friendship is based entirely on political expediency.”</p>
			<p>“And political expediency is subject to change without notice,” Verkan Vall finished for him. “Have you an airboat?”</p>
			<p>“On the landing stage below. Shall we go now, Lord Virzal?”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” Verkan Vall made a two-handed gesture to his Assassins, as though gripping a submachine-gun; they nodded, went into another room, and returned carrying light automatic weapons in their hands and pouches of spare drums slung over their shoulders. “And may I suggest, Dirzed, that one of my Assassins drives the airboat? I want you on the back seat with me, to explain the situation as we go.”</p>
			<p>Dirzed’s teeth flashed white against his brown skin as he gave Verkan Vall a quick smile.</p>
			<p>“By all means, Lord Virzal; I would much rather be distrusted than to find that my client’s friends were not discreet.”</p>
			<p>There were a couple of hotel Assassins guarding Dirzed’s airboat, on the landing stage. Marnik climbed in under the controls, with Olirzon beside him; Verkan Vall and Dirzed entered the rear seat. Dirzed gave Marnik the coordinate reference for their destination.</p>
			<p>“Now, what sort of a place is this, where we’re going?” Verkan Vall asked. “And who’s there whom we may or may not trust?”</p>
			<p>“Well, it’s a dome house belonging to the family of Starpha; they own a five-mile radius around it, oak and beech forest and underbrush, stocked with deer and boar. A hunting lodge. Prince Jirzyn of Starpha, Lord Girzon of Roxor, and a few other top-level Volitionalists, know that the Lady Dallona’s hiding there. They’re keeping her out of sight till after the election, for propaganda purposes. We’ve been hiding there since immediately after the discarnation feast of the Lord Garnon of Roxor.”</p>
			<p>“What happened, after the feast?” Verkan Vall wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“Well, you know how the Lady Dallona and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Harnosh of Hosh had this telepathic-sensitive there, in a trance and drugged with a <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>-derivative alkaloid the Lady Dallona had developed. I was Lord Garnon’s Assassin; I discarnated him, myself. Why, I hadn’t even put my pistol away before he was in control of this sensitive, in a room five stories above the banquet hall; he began communicating at once. We had visiplates to show us what was going on.</p>
			<p>“Right away, Nirzav of Shonna, one of the Statisticalist leaders who was a personal friend of Lord Garnon’s in spite of his politics, renounced Statisticalism and went over to the Volitionalists, on the strength of this communication. Prince Jirzyn, and Lord Girzon, the new family-head of Roxor, decided that there would be trouble in the next few days, so they advised the Lady Dallona to come to this hunting lodge for safety. She and I came here in her airboat, directly from the feast. A good thing we did, too; if we’d gone to her apartment, we’d have walked in before that lethal gas had time to clear.</p>
			<p>“There are four Assassins of the family of Starpha, and six menservants, and an upper-servant named Tarnod, the gamekeeper. The Starpha Assassins and I have been keeping the rest under observation. I left one of the Starpha Assassins guarding the Lady Dallona when I came for you, under brotherly oath to protect her in my name till I returned.”</p>
			<p>The airboat was skimming rapidly above the treetops, toward the northern part of the city.</p>
			<p>“What’s known about that package bomb?” Verkan Vall asked. “Who sent it?”</p>
			<p>Dirzed shrugged. “The Statisticalists, of course. The wrapper was stolen from the Reincarnation Research Institute; so was the case. The Constabulary are working on it.” Dirzed shrugged again.</p>
			<p>The dome, about a hundred and fifty feet in width and some fifty in height, stood among the trees ahead. It was almost invisible from any distance; the concrete dome was of mottled green and gray concrete, trees grew so close as to brush it with their branches, and the little pavilion on the flattened top was roofed with translucent green plastic. As the airboat came in, a couple of men in Assassins’ garb emerged from the pavilion to meet them.</p>
			<p>“Marnik, stay at the controls,” Verkan Vall directed. “I’ll send Olirzon up for you if I want you. If there’s any trouble, take off for Assassins’ Hall and give the code word, then come back with twice as many men as you think you’ll need.”</p>
			<p>Dirzed raised his eyebrows over this. “I hadn’t known the Assassin-President had given you a code word, Lord Virzal,” he commented. “That doesn’t happen very often.”</p>
			<p>“The Assassin-President has honored me with his friendship,” Verkan Vall replied noncommittally, as he, Dirzed and Olirzon climbed out of the airboat. Marnik was holding it an unobtrusive inch or so above the flat top of the dome, away from the edge of the pavilion roof.</p>
			<p>The two Assassins greeted him, and a man in upper-servants’ garb and wearing a hunting knife and a long hunting pistol approached.</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal of Verkan? Welcome to Starpha Dome. The Lady Dallona awaits you below.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall had never been in an Akor-Neb dwelling dome, but a description of such structures had been included in his hypno-mech indoctrination. Originally, they had been the standard structure for all purposes; about two thousand elapsed years ago, when nationalism had still existed on the Akor-Neb Sector, the cities had been almost entirely under ground, as protection from air attack. Even now, the design had been retained by those who wished to live apart from the towering city units, to preserve the natural appearance of the landscape. The Starpha hunting lodge was typical of such domes. Under it was a circular well, eighty feet in depth and fifty in width, with a fountain and a shallow circular pool at the bottom. The storerooms, kitchens and servants’ quarters were at the top, the living quarters at the bottom, in segments of a wide circle around the well, back of balconies.</p>
			<p>“Tarnod, the gamekeeper,” Dirzed performed the introductions. “And Erarno and Kirzol, Assassins.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with them. Tarnod accompanied them to the lifter tubes⁠—two percent positive gravitation for descent and two percent negative for ascent⁠—and they all floated down the former, like air-filled balloons, to the bottom level.</p>
			<p>“The Lady Dallona is in the gun room,” Tarnod informed Verkan Vall, making as though to guide him.</p>
			<p>“Thanks, Tarnod; we know the way,” Dirzed told him shortly, turning his back on the upper-servant and walking toward a closed door on the other side of the fountain. Verkan Vall and Olirzon followed; for a moment, Tarnod stood looking after them, then he followed the other two Assassins into the ascent tube.</p>
			<p>“I don’t relish that fellow,” Dirzed explained. “The family of Starpha use him for work they couldn’t hire an Assassin to do at any price. I’ve been here often, when I was with the Lord Garnon; I’ve always thought he had something on Prince Jirzyn.”</p>
			<p>He knocked sharply on the closed door with the butt of his pistol. In a moment, it slid open, and a young Assassin with a narrow mustache and a tuft of chin beard looked out.</p>
			<p>“Ah, Dirzed.” He stepped outside. “The Lady Dallona is within; I return her to your care.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall entered, followed by Dirzed and Olirzon. The big room was fitted with reclining chairs and couches and low tables; its walls were hung with the heads of deer and boar and wolves, and with racks holding rifles and hunting pistols and fowling pieces. It was filled with the soft glow of indirect cold light. At the far side of the room, a young woman was seated at a desk, speaking softly into a sound transcriber. As they entered, she snapped it off and rose.</p>
			<p>Hadron Dalla wore the same costume Verkan Vall had seen on the visiplate: he recognized her instantly. It took her a second or two to perceive Verkan Vall under the brown skin and black hair of the Lord Virzal of Verkan. Then her face lighted with a happy smile.</p>
			<p>“Why, Va-a-a-ll!” she whooped, running across the room and tossing herself into his not particularly reluctant arms. After all, it had been twenty years⁠—“I didn’t know you, at first!”</p>
			<p>“You mean, in these clothes?” he asked, seeing that she had forgotten, for the moment, the presence of the two Assassins. She had even called him by his First Level name, but that was unimportant⁠—the Akor-Neb affectionate diminutive was formed by omitting the -<i xml:lang="x-akorneb">irz</i>- or -<i xml:lang="x-akorneb">arn</i>-. “Well, they’re not exactly what I generally wear on the plantation.” He kissed her again, then turned to his companions. “Your pardon, Gentlemen-Assassins; it’s been something over a year since we’ve seen each other.”</p>
			<p>Olirzon was smiling at the affectionate reunion; Dirzed wore a look of amused resignation, as though he might have expected something like this to happen. Verkan Vall and Dalla sat down on a couch near the desk.</p>
			<p>“That was really sweet of you, Vall, fighting those men for talking about me,” she began. “You took an awful chance, though. But if you hadn’t, I’d never have known you were in Darsh⁠—Oh-oh! That was why you did it, wasn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I had to do something. Everybody either didn’t know or weren’t saying where you were. I assumed, from the circumstances, that you were hiding somewhere. Tell me, Dalla; do you really have scientific proof of reincarnation? I mean, as an established fact?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes; these people on this sector have had that for over ten centuries. They have hypnotic techniques for getting back into a part of the subconscious mind that we’ve never been able to reach. And after I found out how they did it, I was able to adapt some of our hypno-epistemological techniques to it, and⁠—”</p>
			<p>“All right; that’s what I wanted to know,” he cut her off. “We’re getting out of here, right away.”</p>
			<p>“But where?”</p>
			<p>“Ghamma, in an airboat I have outside, and then back to the First Level. Unless there’s a paratime-transposition conveyor somewhere nearer.”</p>
			<p>“But why, Vall? I’m not ready to go back; I have a lot of work to do here, yet. They’re getting ready to set up a series of control-experiments at the Institute, and then, I’m in the middle of an experiment, a two-hundred-subject memory-recall experiment. See, I distributed two hundred sets of equipment for my new technique⁠—injection-ampoules of this <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zerfa</i>-derivative drug, and sound records of the hypnotic suggestion formula, which can be played on an ordinary reproducer. It’s just a crude variant of our hypno-mech process, except that instead of implanting information in the subconscious mind, to be brought at will to the level of consciousness, it works the other way, and draws into conscious knowledge information already in the subconscious mind. The way these people have always done has been to put the subject in an hypnotic trance and then record verbal statements made in the trance-state; when the subject comes out of the trance, the record is all there is, because the memories of past reincarnations have never been in the conscious mind. But with my process, the subject can consciously remember everything about his last reincarnation, and as many reincarnations before that as he wishes to. I haven’t heard from any of the people who received these auto-recall kits, and I really must⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Dalla, I don’t want to have to pull Paratime Police authority on you, but, so help me, if you don’t come back voluntarily with me, I will. Security of the secret of paratime transposition.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, my eye!” Dalla exclaimed. “Don’t give me that, Vall!”</p>
			<p>“Look, Dalla. Suppose you get discarnated here,” Verkan Vall said. “You say reincarnation is a scientific fact. Well, you’d reincarnate on this sector, and then you’d take a memory-recall, under hypnosis. And when you did, the paratime secret wouldn’t be a secret any more.”</p>
			<p>“Oh!” Dalla’s hand went to her mouth in consternation. Like every paratimer, she was conditioned to shrink with all her being from the mere thought of revealing to any outtime dweller the secret ability of her race to pass to other timelines, or even the existence of alternate lines of probability. “And if I took one of the old-fashioned trance-recalls, I’d blat out everything; I wouldn’t be able to keep a thing back. And I even know the principles of transposition!” She looked at him, aghast.</p>
			<p>“When I get back, I’m going to put a recommendation through department channels that this whole sector be declared out of bounds for all paratime transposition, until you people at Rhogom Foundation work out the problem of discarnate return to the First Level,” he told her. “Now, have you any notes or anything you want to take back with you?”</p>
			<p>She rose. “Yes; just what’s on the desk. Find me something to put the tape spools and notebooks in, while I’m getting them in order.”</p>
			<p>He secured a large game bag from under a rack of fowling pieces, and held it while she sorted the material rapidly, stuffing spools of record tape and notebooks into it. They had barely begun when the door slid open and Olirzon, who had gone outside, sprang into the room, his pistol drawn, swearing vilely.</p>
			<p>“They’ve double-crossed us!” he cried. “The servants of Starpha have turned on us.” He holstered his pistol and snatched up his submachine-gun, taking cover behind the edge of the door and letting go with a burst in the direction of the lifter tubes. “Got that one!” he grunted.</p>
			<p>“What happened, Olirzon?” Verkan Vall asked, dropping the game bag on the table and hurrying across the room.</p>
			<p>“I went up to see how Marnik was making out. As I came out of the lifter tube, one of the obscenities took a shot at me with a hunting pistol. He missed me; I didn’t miss him. Then a couple more of them were coming up, with fowling pieces; I shot one of them before they could fire, and jumped into the descent tube and came down heels over ears. I don’t know what’s happened to Marnik.” He fired another burst, and swore. “Missed him!”</p>
			<p>“Assassins’ Truce! Assassins’ Truce!” a voice howled out of the descent tube. “Hold your fire, we want to parley.”</p>
			<p>“Who is it?” Dirzed shouted, over Olirzon’s shoulder. “You, Sarnax? Come on out; we won’t shoot.”</p>
			<p>The young Assassin with the mustache and chin beard emerged from the descent tube, his weapons sheathed and his clasped hands extended in front of him in a peculiarly ecclesiastical-looking manner. Dirzed and Olirzon stepped out of the gun room, followed by Verkan Vall and Hadron Dalla. Olirzon had left his submachine-gun behind. They met the other Assassin by the rim of the fountain pool.</p>
			<p>“Lady Dallona of Hadron,” the Starpha Assassin began. “I and my colleagues, in the employ of the family of Starpha, have received orders from our clients to withdraw our protection from you, and to discarnate you, and all with you who undertake to protect or support you.” That much sounded like a recitation of some established formula; then his voice became more conversational. “I and my colleagues, Erarno and Kirzol and Harnif, offer our apologies for the barbarity of the servants of the family of Starpha, in attacking without declaration of cessation of friendship. Was anybody hurt or discarnated?”</p>
			<p>“None of us,” Olirzon said. “How about Marnik?”</p>
			<p>“He was warned before hostilities were begun against him,” Sarnax replied. “We will allow five minutes until⁠—”</p>
			<p>Olirzon, who had been looking up the well, suddenly sprang at Dalla, knocking her flat, and at the same time jerking out his pistol. Before he could raise it, a shot banged from above and he fell on his face. Dirzed, Verkan Vall, and Sarnax, all drew their pistols, but whoever had fired the shot had vanished. There was an outburst of shouting above.</p>
			<p>“Get to cover,” Sarnax told the others. “We’ll let you know when we’re ready to attack; we’ll have to deal with whoever fired that shot, first.” He looked at the dead body on the floor, exclaimed angrily, and hurried to the ascent tube, springing upward.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall replaced the small pistol in his shoulder holster and took Olirzon’s belt, with his knife and heavier pistol.</p>
			<p>“Well, there you see,” Dirzed said, as they went back to the gun room. “So much for political expediency.”</p>
			<p>“I think I understand why your picture and the Lady Dallona’s were exhibited so widely,” Verkan Vall said. “Now, anybody would recognize your bodies, and blame the Statisticalists for discarnating you.”</p>
			<p>“That thought had occurred to me, Lord Virzal,” Dirzed said. “I suppose our bodies will be atrociously but not unidentifiably mutilated, to further enrage the public,” he added placidly. “If I get out of this carnate, I’m going to pay somebody off for it.”</p>
			<p>After a few minutes, there was more shouting of: “Assassins’ Truce!” from the descent tube. The two Assassins, Erarno and Kirzol, emerged, dragging the gamekeeper, Tarnod, between them. The upper-servant’s face was bloody, and his jaw seemed to be broken. Sarnax followed, carrying a long hunting pistol in his hand.</p>
			<p>“Here he is!” he announced. “He fired during Assassins’ Truce; he’s subject to Assassins’ Justice!”</p>
			<p>He nodded to the others. They threw the gamekeeper forward on the floor, and Sarnax shot him through the head, then tossed the pistol down beside him. “Any more of these people who violate the decencies will be treated similarly,” he promised.</p>
			<p>“Thank you, Sarnax,” Dirzed spoke up. “But we lost an Assassin: discarnating this lackey won’t equalize that. We think you should retire one of your number.”</p>
			<p>“That at least, Dirzed; wait a moment.”</p>
			<p>The three Assassins conferred at some length. Then Sarnax hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with his companions.</p>
			<p>“See you in the next reincarnation, brothers,” he told them, walking toward the gun-room door, where Verkan Vall, Dalla and Dirzed stood. “I’m joining you people. You had two Assassins when the parley began, you’ll have two when the shooting starts.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall looked at Dirzed in some surprise. Hadron Dalla’s Assassin nodded.</p>
			<p>“He’s entitled to do that, Lord Virzal; the Assassins’ code provides for such changes of allegiance.”</p>
			<p>“Welcome, Sarnax,” Verkan Vall said, hooking fingers with him. “I hope we’ll all be together when this is over.”</p>
			<p>“We will be,” Sarnax assured him cheerfully. “Discarnate. We won’t get out of this in the body, Lord Virzal.”</p>
			<p>A submachine-gun hammered from above, the bullets lashing the fountain pool; the water actually steamed, so great was their velocity.</p>
			<p>“All right!” a voice called down. “Assassins’ Truce is over!”</p>
			<p>Another burst of automatic fire smashed out the lights at the bottom of the ascent tube. Dirzed and Dalla struggled across the room, pushing a heavy steel cabinet between them; Verkan Vall, who was holding Olirzon’s submachine-gun, moved aside to allow them to drop it on edge in the open doorway, then wedged the door half-shut against it. Sarnax came over, bringing rifles, hunting pistols, and ammunition.</p>
			<p>“What’s the situation, up there?” Verkan Vall asked him. “What force have they, and why did they turn against us?”</p>
			<p>“Lord Virzal!” Dirzed objected, scandalized. “You have no right to ask Sarnax to betray confidences!”</p>
			<p>Sarnax spat against the door. “In the face of Jirzyn of Starpha!” he said. “And in the face of his <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zortan</i> mother, and of his father, whoever he was! Dirzed, do not talk foolishly; one does not speak of betraying betrayers.” He turned to Verkan Vall. “They have three menservants of the family of Starpha; your Assassin, Olirzon, discarnated the other three. There is one of Prince Jirzyn’s poor relations, named Girzad. There are three other men, Volitionalist precinct workers, who came with Girzad, and four Assassins, the three who were here, and one who came with Girzad. Eleven, against the three of us.”</p>
			<p>“The four of us, Sarnax,” Dalla corrected. She had buckled on a hunting pistol, and had a light deer rifle under her arm.</p>
			<p>Something moved at the bottom of the descent tube. Verkan Vall gave it a short burst, though it was probably only a dummy, dropped to draw fire.</p>
			<p>“The four of us, Lady Dallona,” Sarnax agreed. “As to your other Assassin, the one who stayed in the airboat, I don’t know how he fared. You see, about twenty minutes ago, this Girzad arrived in an airboat, with an Assassin and these three Volitionalist workers. Erarno and I were at the top of the dome when he came in. He told us that he had orders from Prince Jirzyn to discarnate the Lady Dallona and Dirzed at once. Tarnod, the gamekeeper”⁠—Sarnax spat ceremoniously against the door again⁠—“told him you were here, and that Marnik was one of your men. He was going to shoot Marnik at once, but Erarno and I and his Assassin stopped him. We warned Marnik about the change in the situation, according to the code, expecting Marnik to go down here and join you. Instead, he lifted the airboat, zoomed over Girzad’s boat, and let go a rocket blast, setting Girzad’s boat on fire. Well, that was a hostile act, so we all fired after him. We must have hit something, because the boat went down, trailing smoke, about ten miles away. Girzad got another airboat out of the hangar and he and his Assassin started after your man. About that time, your Assassin, Olirzon⁠—happy reincarnation to him⁠—came up, and the Starpha servants fired at him, and he fired back and discarnated two of them, and then jumped down the descent tube. One of the servants jumped after him; I found his body at the bottom when I came down to warn you formally. You know what happened after that.”</p>
			<p>“But why did Prince Jirzyn order our discarnation?” Dalla wanted to know. “Was it to blame the Statisticalists with it?”</p>
			<p>Sarnax, about to answer, broke off suddenly and began firing at the opening of the ascent tube with a hunting pistol.</p>
			<p>“I got him,” he said, in a pleased tone. “That was Erarno; he was always playing tricks with the tubes, climbing down against negative gravity and up against positive gravity. His body will float up to the top⁠—Why, Lady Dallona, that was only part of it. You didn’t hear about the big scandal, on the newscast, then?”</p>
			<p>“We didn’t have it on. What scandal?”</p>
			<p>Sarnax laughed. “Oh, the very father and family-head of all scandals! You ought to know about it, because you started it; that’s why Prince Jirzyn wants you out of the body⁠—You devised a process by which people could give themselves memory-recalls of previous reincarnations, didn’t you? And distributed apparatus to do it with? And gave one set to young Tarnov, the son of Lord Tirzov of Fastor?”</p>
			<p>Dalla nodded. Sarnax continued:</p>
			<p>“Well, last evening, Tarnov of Fastor used his recall outfit, and what do you think? It seems that thirty years ago, in his last reincarnation, he was Jirzid of Starpha, Jirzyn’s older brother. Jirzid was betrothed to the Lady Annitra of Zabna. Well, his younger brother was carrying on a clandestine affair with the Lady Annitra, and he also wanted the title of Prince and family-head of Starpha. So he bribed this fellow Tarnod, whom I had the pleasure of discarnating, and who was an underservant here at the hunting lodge. Between them, they shot Jirzid during a boar hunt. An accident, of course. So Jirzyn married the Lady Annitra, and when old Prince Jarnid, his father, discarnated a year later, he succeeded to the title. And immediately, Tarnod was made head gamekeeper here.”</p>
			<p>“What did I tell you, Lord Virzal? I knew that son of a <i xml:lang="x-akorneb">zortan</i> had something on Jirzyn of Starpha!” Dirzed exclaimed. “A nice family, this of Starpha!”</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s not the end of it,” Sarnax continued. “This morning, Tarnov of Fastor, late Jirzid of Starpha, went before the High Court of Estates and entered suit to change his name to Jirzid of Starpha and laid claim to the title of Starpha family-head. The case has just been entered, so there’s been no hearing, but there’s the blazes of an argument among all the nobles about it⁠—some are claiming that the individuality doesn’t change from one reincarnation to the next, and others claiming that property and titles should pass along the line of physical descent, no matter what individuality has reincarnated into what body. They’re the ones who want the Lady Dallona discarnated and her discoveries suppressed. And there’s talk about revising the entire system of estate-ownership and estate-inheritance. Oh, it’s an utter obscenity of a business!”</p>
			<p>“This,” Verkan Vall told Dalla, “is something we will not emphasize when we get home.” That was as close as he dared come to it, but she caught his meaning. The working of major changes in outtime social structures was not viewed with approval by the Paratime Commission on the First Level. “<em>If</em> we get home,” he added. Then an idea occurred to him.</p>
			<p>“Dirzed, Sarnax; this place must have been used by the leaders of the Volitionalists for top-level conferences. Is there a secret passage anywhere?”</p>
			<p>Sarnax shook his head. “Not from here. There is one, on the floor above, but they control it. And even if there were one down here, they would be guarding the outlet.”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I was counting on. I’d hoped to simulate an escape that way, and then make a rush up the regular tubes.” Verkan Vall shrugged. “I suppose Marnik’s our only chance. I hope he got away safely.”</p>
			<p>“He was going for help? I was surprised that an Assassin would desert his client; I should have thought of that,” Sarnax said. “Well, even if he got down carnate, and if Girzad didn’t catch him, he’d still be afoot ten miles from the nearest city unit. That gives us a little chance⁠—about one in a thousand.”</p>
			<p>“Is there any way they can get at us, except by those tubes?” Dalla asked.</p>
			<p>“They could cut a hole in the floor, or burn one through,” Sarnax replied. “They have plenty of thermite. They could detonate a charge of explosives over our heads, or clear out of the dome and drop one down the well. They could use lethal gas or radio-dust, but their Assassins wouldn’t permit such illegal methods. Or they could shoot sleep-gas down at us, and then come down and cut our throats at their leisure.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll have to get out of this room, then,” Verkan Vall decided. “They know we’ve barricaded ourselves in here; this is where they’ll attack. So we’ll patrol the perimeter of the well; we’ll be out of danger from above if we keep close to the wall. And we’ll inspect all the rooms on this floor for evidence of cutting through from above.”</p>
			<p>Sarnax nodded. “That’s sense, Lord Virzal. How about the lifter tubes?”</p>
			<p>“We’ll have to barricade them. Sarnax, you and Dirzed know the layout of this place better than the Lady Dallona or I; suppose you two check the rooms, while we cover the tubes and the well,” Verkan Vall directed. “Come on, now.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They pushed the door wide-open and went out past the cabinet. Hugging the wall, they began a slow circuit of the well, Verkan Vall in the lead with the submachine-gun, then Sarnax and Dirzed, the former with a heavy boar-rifle and the latter with a hunting pistol in each hand, and Hadron Dalla brought up in the rear with her rifle. It was she who noticed a movement along the rim of the balcony above and snapped a shot at it; there was a crash above, and a shower of glass and plastic and metal fragments rattled on the pavement of the court. Somebody had been trying to lower a scanner or a visiplate-pickup, or something of the sort; the exact nature of the instrument was not evident from the wreckage Dalla’s bullet had made of it.</p>
			<p>The rooms Dirzed and Sarnax entered were all quiet; nobody seemed to be attempting to cut through the ceiling, fifteen feet above. They dragged furniture from a couple of rooms, blocking the openings of the lifter tubes, and continued around the well until they had reached the gun room again.</p>
			<p>Dirzed suggested that they move some of the weapons and ammunition stored there to Prince Jirzyn’s private apartment, halfway around to the lifter tubes, so that another place of refuge would be stocked with munitions in event of their being driven from the gun room.</p>
			<p>Leaving him on guard outside, Verkan Vall, Dalla and Sarnax entered the gun room and began gathering weapons and boxes of ammunition. Dalla finished packing her game bag with the recorded data and notes of her experiments. Verkan Vall selected four more of the heavy hunting pistols, more accurate than his shoulder-holster weapon or the dead Olirzon’s belt arm, and capable of either full or semiautomatic fire. Sarnax chose a couple more boar rifles. Dalla slung her bag of recorded notes, and another bag of ammunition, and secured another deer rifle. They carried this accumulation of munitions to the private apartments of Prince Jirzyn, dumping everything in the middle of the drawing room, except the bag of notes, from which Dalla refused to separate herself.</p>
			<p>“Maybe we’d better put some stuff over in one of the rooms on the other side of the well,” Dirzed suggested. “They haven’t really begun to come after us; when they do, we’ll probably be attacked from two or three directions at once.”</p>
			<p>They returned to the gun room, casting anxious glances at the edge of the balcony above and at the barricade they had erected across the openings to the lifter tubes. Verkan Vall was not satisfied with this last; it looked to him as though they had provided a breastwork for somebody to fire on them from, more than anything else.</p>
			<p>He was about to step around the cabinet which partially blocked the gun-room door when he glanced up, and saw a six-foot circle on the ceiling turning slowly brown. There was a smell of scorched plastic. He grabbed Sarnax by the arm and pointed.</p>
			<p>“Thermite,” the Assassin whispered. “The ceiling’s got six inches of spaceship-insulation between it and the floor above; it’ll take them a few minutes to burn through it.” He stooped and pushed on the barricade, shoving it into the room. “Keep back; they’ll probably drop a grenade or so through, first, before they jump down. If we’re quick, we can get a couple of them.”</p>
			<p>Dirzed and Sarnax crouched, one at either side of the door, with weapons ready. Verkan Vall and Dalla had been ordered, rather peremptorily, to stay behind them; in a place of danger, an Assassin was obliged to shield his client. Verkan Vall, unable to see what was going on inside the room, kept his eyes and his gun muzzle on the barricade across the openings to the lifter tubes, the erection of which he was now regretting as a major tactical error.</p>
			<p>Inside the gun room, there was a sudden crash, as the circle of thermite burned through and a section of ceiling dropped out and hit the floor. Instantly, Dirzed flung himself back against Verkan Vall, and there was a tremendous explosion inside, followed by another and another. A second or so passed, then Dirzed, leaning around the corner of the door, began firing rapidly into the room. From the other side of the door, Sarnax began blazing away with his rifle. Verkan Vall kept his position, covering the lifter tubes.</p>
			<p>Suddenly, from behind the barricade, a blue-white gun flash leaped into being, and a pistol banged. He sprayed the opening between a couch and a section of bookcase from whence it had come, releasing his trigger as the gun rose with the recoil, squeezing and releasing and squeezing again. Then he jumped to his feet.</p>
			<p>“Come on, the other place; hurry!” he ordered.</p>
			<p>Sarnax swore in exasperation. “Help me with her, Dirzed!” he implored.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall turned his head, to see the two Assassins drag Dalla to her feet and hustle her away from the gun room; she was quite senseless, and they had to drag her between them. Verkan Vall gave a quick glance into the gun room; two of the Starpha servants and a man in rather flashy civil dress were lying on the floor, where they had been shot as they had jumped down from above. He saw a movement at the edge of the irregular, smoking, hole in the ceiling, and gave it a short burst, then fired another at the exit from the descent tube. Then he took to his heels and followed the Assassins and Hadron Dalla into Prince Jirzyn’s apartment.</p>
			<p>As he ran through the open door, the Assassins were letting Dalla down into a chair; they instantly threw themselves into the work of barricading the doorway so as to provide cover and at the same time allow them to fire out into the central well.</p>
			<p>For an instant, as he bent over her, he thought Dalla had been killed, an assumption justified by his knowledge of the deadliness of Akor-Neb bullets. Then he saw her eyelids flicker. A moment later, he had the explanation of her escape. The bullet had hit the game bag at her side; it was full of spools of metal tape, in metal cases, and notes in written form, pyrographed upon sheets of plastic ring fastened into metal binders. Because of their extreme velocity, Akor-Neb bullets were sure killers when they struck animal tissue, but for the same reason, they had very poor penetration on hard objects. The alloy-steel tape, and the steel spools and spool cases, and the notebook binders, had been enough to shatter the little bullet into splinters of magnesium-nickel alloy, and the stout leather back of the game bag had stopped all of these. But the impact, even distributed as it had been through the contents of the bag, had been enough to knock the girl unconscious.</p>
			<p>He found a bottle of some sort of brandy and a glass on a serving table nearby and poured her a drink, holding it to her lips. She spluttered over the first mouthful, then took the glass from him and sipped the rest.</p>
			<p>“What happened?” she asked. “I thought those bullets were sure death.”</p>
			<p>“Your notes. The bullet hit the bag. Are you all right, now?”</p>
			<p>She finished the brandy. “I think so.” She put a hand into the game bag and brought out a snarled and tangled mess of steel tape. “Oh, <em>blast</em>! That stuff was important; all the records on the preliminary auto-recall experiments.” She shrugged. “Well, it wouldn’t have been worth much more if I’d stopped that bullet, myself.” She slipped the strap over her shoulder and started to rise.</p>
			<p>As she did, a bedlam of firing broke out, both from the two Assassins at the door and from outside. They both hit the floor and crawled out of line of the partly-open door; Verkan Vall recovered his submachine-gun, which he had set down beside Dalla’s chair. Sarnax was firing with his rifle at some target in the direction of the lifter tubes; Dirzed lay slumped over the barricade, and one glance at his crumpled figure was enough to tell Verkan Vall that he was dead.</p>
			<p>“You fill magazines for us,” he told Dalla, then crawled to Dirzed’s place at the door. “What happened, Sarnax?”</p>
			<p>“They shoved over the barricade at the lifter tubes and came out into the well. I got a couple, they got Dirzed, and now they’re holed up in rooms all around the circle. They⁠—Aah!” He fired three shots, quickly, around the edge of the door. “That stopped that.” The Assassin crouched to insert a fresh magazine into his rifle.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall risked one eye around the corner of the doorway, and as he did, there was a red flash and a dull roar, unlike the blue flashes and sharp cracking reports of the pistols and rifles, from the doorway of the gun room. He wondered, for a split second, if it might be one of the fowling pieces he had seen there, and then something whizzed past his head and exploded with a soft <i>plop</i> behind him. Turning, he saw a pool of gray vapor beginning to spread in the middle of the room. Dalla must have got a breath of it, for she was slumped over the chair from which she had just risen.</p>
			<p>Dropping the submachine-gun and gulping a lungful of fresh air from outside, Verkan Vall rushed to her, caught her by the heels, and dragged her into Prince Jirzyn’s bedroom, beyond. Leaving her in the middle of the floor, he took another deep breath and returned to the drawing room, where Sarnax was already overcome by the sleep-gas.</p>
			<p>He saw the serving table from which he had got the brandy, and dragged it over to the bedroom door, overturning it and laying it across the doorway, its legs in the air. Like most Akor-Neb serving tables, it had a gravity-counteraction unit under it; he set this for double minus-gravitation and snapped it on. As it was now above the inverted table, the table did not rise, but a tendril, of sleep-gas, curling toward it, bent upward and drifted away from the doorway. Satisfied that he had made a temporary barrier against the sleep-gas, Verkan Vall secured Dalla’s hunting pistol and spare magazines and lay down at the bedroom door.</p>
			<p>For some time, there was silence outside. Then the besiegers evidently decided that the sleep-gas attack had been a success. An Assassin, wearing a gas mask and carrying a submachine-gun, appeared in the doorway, and behind him came a tall man in a tan tunic, similarly masked. They stepped into the room and looked around.</p>
			<p>Knowing that he would be shooting over a two hundred percent negative gravitation-field, Verkan Vall aimed for the Assassin’s belt-buckle and squeezed. The bullet caught him in the throat. Evidently the bullet had not only been lifted in the negative gravitation, but lifted point-first and deflected upward. He held his front sight just above the other man’s knee, and hit him in the chest.</p>
			<p>As he fired, he saw a wisp of gas come sliding around the edge of the inverted table. There was silence outside, and for an instant, he was tempted to abandon his post and go to the bathroom, back of the bedroom, for wet towels to improvise a mask. Then, when he tried to crawl backward, he could not. There was an impression of distant shouting which turned to a roaring sound in his head. He tried to lift his pistol, but it slipped from his fingers.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>When consciousness returned, he was lying on his back, and something cold and rubbery was pressing into his face. He raised his arms to fight off whatever it was, and opened his eyes, to find that he was staring directly at the red oval and winged bullet of the Society of Assassins. A hand caught his wrist as he reached for the small pistol under his arm. The pressure on his face eased.</p>
			<p>“It’s all right, Lord Virzal,” a voice came to him. “Assassins’ Truce!”</p>
			<p>He nodded stupidly and repeated the words. “Assassins’ Truce; I won’t shoot. What happened?”</p>
			<p>Then he sat up and looked around. Prince Jirzyn’s bedchamber was full of Assassins. Dalla, recovering from her touch of sleep-gas, was sitting groggily in a chair, while five or six of them fussed around her, getting in each others’ way, handing her drinks, chaffing her wrists, holding damp cloths on her brow. That was standard procedure, when any group of males thought Dalla needed any help. Another Assassin, beside the bed, was putting away an oxygen-mask outfit, and the Assassin who had prevented Verkan Vall from drawing his pistol was his own follower, Marnik. And Klarnood, the Assassin-President, was sitting on the foot of the bed, smoking one of Prince Jirzyn’s monogrammed and crested cigarettes critically.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall looked at Marnik, and then at Klarnood, and back to Marnik.</p>
			<p>“You got through,” he said. “Good work, Marnik; I thought they’d downed you.”</p>
			<p>“They did; I had to crash-land in the woods. I went about a mile on foot, and then I found a man and woman and two children, hiding in one of these little log rain shelters. They had an airboat, a good one. It seemed that rioting had broken out in the city unit where they lived, and they’d taken to the woods till things quieted down again. I offered them Assassins’ protection if they’d take me to Assassins’ Hall, and they did.”</p>
			<p>“By luck, I was in when Marnik arrived,” Klarnood took over. “We brought three boatloads of men, and came here at once. Just as we got here, two boatloads of Starpha dependents arrived; they tried to give us an argument, and we discarnated the lot of them. Then we came down here, crying Assassins’ Truce. One of the Starpha Assassins, Kirzol, was still carnate; he told us what had been going on.” The President-General’s face-became grim. “You know, I take a rather poor view of Prince Jirzyn’s procedure in this matter, not to mention that of his underlings. I’ll have to speak to him about this. Now, how about you and the Lady Dallona? What do you intend doing?”</p>
			<p>“We’re getting out of here,” Verkan Vall said. “I’d like air transport and protection as far as Ghamma, to the establishment of the family of Zorda. Brarnend of Zorda has a private space yacht; he’ll get us to Venus.”</p>
			<p>Klarnood gave a sigh of obvious relief. “I’ll have you and the Lady Dallona airborne and off for Ghamma as soon as you wish,” he promised. “I will, frankly, be delighted to see the last of both of you. The Lady Dallona has started a fire here at Darsh that won’t burn out in a half-century, and who knows what it may consume.” He was interrupted by a heaving shock that made the underground dome dwelling shake like a light airboat in turbulence. Even eighty feet under the ground, they could hear a continued crashing roar. It was an appreciable interval before the sound and the shock ceased.</p>
			<p>For an instant, there was silence, and then an excited bedlam of shouting broke from the Assassins in the room: Klarnood’s face was frozen in horror.</p>
			<p>“That was a fission bomb!” he exclaimed. “The first one that has been exploded on this planet in hostility in a thousand years!” He turned to Verkan Vall. “If you feel well enough to walk, Lord Virzal, come with us. I must see what’s happened.”</p>
			<p>They hurried from the room and went streaming up the ascent tube to the top of the dome. About forty miles away, to the south, Verkan Vall saw the sinister thing that he had seen on so many other timelines, in so many other paratime sectors⁠—a great pillar of varicolored fire-shot smoke, rising to a mushroom head fifty thousand feet above.</p>
			<p>“Well, that’s it,” Klarnood said sadly. “That is civil war.”</p>
			<p>“May I make a suggestion, Assassin-President?” Verkan Vall asked. “I understand that Assassins’ Truce is binding even upon non-Assassins; is that correct?”</p>
			<p>“Well, not exactly; it’s generally kept by such non-Assassins as want to remain in their present reincarnations, though.”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I meant. Well, suppose you declare a general, planetwide Assassins’ Truce in this political war, and make the leaders of both parties responsible for keeping it. Publish lists of the top two or three thousand Statisticalists and Volitionalists, starting with Mirzark of Bashad and Prince Jirzyn of Starpha, and inform them that they will be assassinated, in order, if the fighting doesn’t cease.”</p>
			<p>“Well!” A smile grew on Klarnood’s face. “Lord Virzal, my thanks; a good suggestion. I’ll try it. And furthermore, I’ll withdraw all Assassin protection permanently from anybody involved in political activity, and forbid any Assassin to accept any retainer connected with political factionalism. It’s about time our members stopped discarnating each other in these political squabbles.” He pointed to the three airboats drawn up on the top of the dome; speedy black craft, bearing the red oval and winged bullet. “Take your choice, Lord Virzal. I’ll lend you a couple of my men, and you’ll be in Ghamma in three hours.” He hooked fingers and clapped shoulders with Verkan Vall, bent over Dalla’s hand. “I still like you, Lord Virzal, and I have seldom met a more charming lady than you, Lady Dallona. But I sincerely hope I never see either of you again.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The ship for Dhergabar was driving north and west; at seventy thousand feet, it was still daylight, but the world below was wrapping itself in darkness. In the big visiscreens, which served in lieu of the windows which could never have withstood the pressure and friction heat of the ship’s speed, the sun was sliding out of sight over the horizon to port. Verkan Vall and Dalla sat together, watching the blazing western sky⁠—the sky of their own First Level timeline.</p>
			<p>“I blame myself terribly, Vall,” Dalla was saying. “And I didn’t mean any of them the least harm. All I was interested in was learning the facts. I know, that sounds like ‘I didn’t know it was loaded,’ but⁠—”</p>
			<p>“It sounds to me like those Fourth Level Europo-American Sector physicists who are giving themselves guilt-complexes because they designed an atomic bomb,” Verkan Vall replied. “All you were interested in was learning the facts. Well, as a scientist, that’s all you’re supposed to be interested in. You don’t have to worry about any social or political implications. People have to learn to live with newly-discovered facts; if they don’t, they die of them.”</p>
			<p>“But, Vall; that sounds dreadfully irresponsible⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Does it? You’re worrying about the results of your reincarnation memory-recall discoveries, the shootings and riotings and the bombing we saw.” He touched the pommel of Olirzon’s knife, which he still wore. “You’re no more guilty of that than the man who forged this blade is guilty of the death of Marnark of Bashad; if he’d never lived, I’d have killed Marnark with some other knife somebody else made. And what’s more, you can’t know the results of your discoveries. All you can see is a thin film of events on the surface of an immediate situation, so you can’t say whether the long-term results will be beneficial or calamitous.</p>
			<p>“Take this Fourth Level Europo-American atomic bomb, for example. I choose that because we both know that sector, but I could think of a hundred other examples in other paratime areas. Those people, because of deforestation, bad agricultural methods and general mismanagement, are eroding away their arable soil at an alarming rate. At the same time, they are breeding like rabbits. In other words, each successive generation has less and less food to divide among more and more people, and, for inherited traditional and superstitious reasons, they refuse to adopt any rational program of birth-control and population-limitation.</p>
			<p>“But, fortunately, they now have the atomic bomb, and they are developing radioactive poisons, weapons of mass-effect. And their racial, nationalistic and ideological conflicts are rapidly reaching the explosion point. A series of all-out atomic wars is just what that sector needs, to bring their population down to their world’s carrying capacity; in a century or so, the inventors of the atomic bomb will be hailed as the saviors of their species.”</p>
			<p>“But how about my work on the Akor-Neb Sector?” Dalla asked. “It seems that my memory-recall technique is more explosive than any fission bomb. I’ve laid the train for a century-long reign of anarchy!”</p>
			<p>“I doubt that; I think Klarnood will take hold, now that he has committed himself to it. You know, in spite of his sanguinary profession, he’s the nearest thing to a real man of good will I’ve found on that sector. And here’s something else you haven’t considered. Our own First Level life expectancy is from four to five hundred years. That’s the main reason why we’ve accomplished as much as we have. We have, individually, time to accomplish things. On the Akor-Neb Sector, a scientist or artist or scholar or statesman will grow senile and die before he’s as old as either of us. But now, a young student of twenty or so can take one of your auto-recall treatments and immediately have available all the knowledge and experience gained in four or five previous lives. He can start where he left off in his last reincarnation. In other words, you’ve made those people time-binders, individually as well as racially. Isn’t that worth the temporary discarnation of a lot of ward-heelers and plug-uglies, or even a few decent types like Dirzed and Olirzon? If it isn’t, I don’t know what scales of values you’re using.”</p>
			<p>“Vall!” Dalla’s eyes glowed with enthusiasm. “I never thought of that! And you said, ‘temporary discarnation.’ That’s just what it is. Dirzed and Olirzon and the others aren’t dead; they’re just waiting, discarnate, between physical lives. You know, in the sacred writings of one of the Fourth Level peoples it is stated: ‘Death is the last enemy.’ By proving that death is just a cyclic condition of continued individual existence, these people have conquered their last enemy.”</p>
			<p>“Last enemy but one,” Verkan Vall corrected. “They still have one enemy to go, an enemy within themselves. Call it semantic confusion, or illogic, or incomprehension, or just plain stupidity. Like Klarnood, stymied by verbal objections to something labeled ‘political intervention.’ He’d never have consented to use the power of his Society if he hadn’t been shocked out of his inhibitions by that nuclear bomb. Or the Statisticalists, trying to create a classless order of society through a political program which would only result in universal servitude to an omnipotent government. Or the Volitionalist nobles, trying to preserve their hereditary feudal privileges, and now they can’t even agree on a definition of the term ‘hereditary.’ Might they not recover all the silly prejudices of their past lives, along with the knowledge and wisdom?”</p>
			<p>“Bu.⁠ ⁠… I thought you said⁠—” Dalla was puzzled, a little hurt.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall’s arm squeezed around her waist, and he laughed comfortingly.</p>
			<p>“You see? Any sort of result is possible, good or bad. So don’t blame yourself in advance for something you can’t possibly estimate.” An idea occurred to him, and he straightened in the seat. “Tell you what; if you people at Rhogom Foundation get the problem of discarnate paratime transposition licked by then, let’s you and I go back to the Akor-Neb Sector in about a hundred years and see what sort of a mess those people have made of things.”</p>
			<p>“A hundred years: that would be Year Twenty-Two of the next millennium. It’s a date, Vall; we’ll do it.”</p>
			<p>They bent to light their cigarettes together at his lighter. When they raised their heads again and got the flame glare out of their eyes, the sky was purple-black, dusted with stars, and dead ahead, spilling up over the horizon, was a golden glow⁠—the lights of Dhergabar and home.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">I</h3>
				<p>They started giving me the business as soon as I came through the door into the Secretary’s outer office.</p>
				<p>There was Ethel K’wang-Li, the Secretary’s receptionist, at her desk. There was Courtlant Staynes, the assistant secretary to the Undersecretary for Economic Penetration, and Norman Gazarin, from Protocol, and Toby Lawder, from Humanoid Peoples’ Affairs, and Raoul Chavier, and Hans Mannteufel, and Olga Reznik.</p>
				<p>It was a wonder there weren’t more of them watching the condemned man’s march to the gibbet: the word that the Secretary had called me in must have gotten all over the Department since the offices had opened.</p>
				<p>“Ah, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Machiavelli, I presume,” Ethel kicked off.</p>
				<p>“Machiavelli, Junior.” Olga picked up the ball. “At least, that’s the way he signs it.”</p>
				<p>“God’s gift to the Consular Service, and the Consular Service’s gift to Policy Planning,” Gazarin added.</p>
				<p>“Take it easy, folks. These Hooligan Diplomats would as soon shoot you as look at you,” Mannteufel warned.</p>
				<p>“Be sure and tell the Secretary that your friends all want important posts in the Galactic Empire.” Olga again.</p>
				<p>“Well, I’m glad some of you could read it,” I fired back. “Maybe even a few of you understood what it was all about.”</p>
				<p>“Don’t worry, Silk,” Gazarin told me. “Secretary Ghopal understands what it was all about. All too well, you’ll find.”</p>
				<p>A buzzer sounded gently on Ethel K’wang-Li’s desk. She snatched up the handphone and whispered into it. A deathly silence filled the room while she listened, whispered some more, then hung it up.</p>
				<p>They were all staring at me.</p>
				<p>“Secretary Ghopal is ready to see <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen Silk,” she said. “This way, please.”</p>
				<p>As I started across the room, Staynes began drumming on the top of the desk with his fingers, the slow reiterated rhythm to which a man marches to a military execution.</p>
				<p>“A cigarette?” Lawder inquired tonelessly. “A glass of rum?”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>There were three men in the Secretary of State’s private office. Ghopal Singh, the Secretary, dark-faced, gray-haired, slender and elegant, meeting me halfway to his desk. Another slender man, in black, with a silver-threaded, black neck-scarf: Rudolf Klüng, the Secretary of the Department of Aggression.</p>
				<p>And a huge, gross-bodied man with a fat baby-face and opaque black eyes.</p>
				<p>When I saw him, I really began to get frightened.</p>
				<p>The fat man was Natalenko, the Security Coordinator.</p>
				<p>“Good morning, Mister Silk,” Secretary Ghopal greeted me, his hand extended. “Gentlemen, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen Silk, about whom we were speaking. This way, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk, if you please.”</p>
				<p>There was a low coffee-table at the rear of the office, and four easy chairs around it. On the round brass tabletop were cups and saucers, a coffee urn, cigarettes⁠—and a copy of the current issue of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Galactic Statesmen’s Journal</i>, open at an article entitled “Probable Future Courses of Solar League Diplomacy,” by somebody who had signed himself Machiavelli, <abbr class="eoc">Jr.</abbr></p>
				<p>I was beginning to wish that the pseudonymous Machiavelli, <abbr>Jr.</abbr> had never been born, or, at least, had stayed on Theta Virgo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> and been a wineberry planter as his father had wanted him to be.</p>
				<p>As I sat down and accepted a cup of coffee, I avoided looking at the periodical. They were probably going to hang it around my neck before they shoved me out of the airlock.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk is, as you know, in our Consular Service,” Ghopal was saying to the others. “Back on Luna on rotation, doing something in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Halvord’s section. He is the gentleman who did such a splendid job for us on Assha⁠—Gamma Norma <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>.</p>
				<p>“And, as he has just demonstrated,” he added, gesturing toward the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Statesman’s Journal</i> on the Benares-work table, “he is a student both of the diplomacy of the past and the implications of our present policies.”</p>
				<p>“A bit frank,” Klüng commented dubiously.</p>
				<p>“But judicious,” Natalenko squeaked, in the high eunuchoid voice that came so incongruously from his bulk. “He aired his singularly accurate predictions in a periodical that doesn’t have a circulation of more than a thousand copies outside his own department. And I don’t think the public’s semantic reactions to the terminology of imperialism is as bad as you imagine. They seem quite satisfied, now, with the change in the title of your department, from Defense to Aggression.”</p>
				<p>“Well, we’ve gone into that, gentlemen,” Ghopal said. “If the article really makes trouble for us, we can always disavow it. There’s no censorship of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Journal</i>. And <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk won’t be around to draw fire on us.”</p>
				<p><q>Here it comes</q>, I thought.</p>
				<p>“That sounds pretty ominous, doesn’t it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk?” Natalenko tittered happily, like a ten-year-old who has just found a new beetle to pull the legs out of.</p>
				<p>“It’s really not as bad as it sounds, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Ghopal hastened to reassure me. “We are going to have to banish you for a while, but I daresay that won’t be so bad. The social life here on Luna has probably begun to pall, anyhow. So we’re sending you to Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>.”</p>
				<p>“Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>,” I repeated, trying to remember something about it. Capella was a G0-type, like Sol; that wouldn’t be so bad.</p>
				<p>“New Texas,” Klüng helped me out.</p>
				<p><q>Oh, God, no!</q> I thought.</p>
				<p>“It happens that we need somebody of your sort on that planet, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Ghopal said. “Some of the trouble is in my department and some of it is in <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Klüng’s; for that reason, perhaps it would be better if Coordinator Natalenko explained it to you.”</p>
				<p>“You know, I assume, our chief interest in New Texas?” Natalenko asked.</p>
				<p>“I had some of it for breakfast, sir,” I replied. “Supercow.”</p>
				<p>Natalenko tittered again. “Yes, New Texas is the butcher shop of the galaxy. In more ways than one, I’m afraid you’ll find. They just butchered one of our people there a short while ago. Our Ambassador, in fact.”</p>
				<p>That would be Silas Cumshaw, and this was the first I’d heard about it.</p>
				<p>I asked when it had happened.</p>
				<p>“A couple of months ago. We just heard about it last evening, when the news came in on a freighter from there. Which serves to point up something you stressed in your article⁠—the difficulties of trying to run a centralized democratic government on a galactic scale. But we have another interest, which may be even more urgent than our need for New Texan meat. You’ve heard, of course, of the z’Srauff.”</p>
				<p>That was a statement, not a question; Natalenko wasn’t trying to insult me. I knew who the z’Srauff were; I’d run into them, here and there. One of the extrasolar intelligent humanoid races, who seemed to have been evolved from canine or canine-like ancestors, instead of primates. Most of them could speak Basic English, but I never saw one who would admit to understanding more of our language than the 850-word Basic vocabulary. They occupied a half-dozen planets in a small star-cluster about forty light-years beyond the Capella system. They had developed normal-space reaction-drive ships before we came into contact with them, and they had quickly picked up the hyperspace-drive from us back in those days when the Solar League was still playing Missionaries of Progress and trying to run a galaxy-wide Point-Four program.</p>
				<p>In the past century, it had become almost impossible for anybody to get into their star-group, although z’Srauff ships were orbiting in on every planet that the League had settled or controlled. There were z’Srauff traders and small merchants all over the galaxy, and you almost never saw one of them without a camera. Their little meteor-mining boats were everywhere, and all of them carried more of the most modern radar and astrogational equipment than a meteor-miner’s lifetime earnings would pay for.</p>
				<p>I also knew that they were one of the chief causes of ulcers and premature gray hair at the League capital on Luna. I’d done a little reading on pre-spaceflight Terran history; I had been impressed by the parallel between the present situation and one which had culminated, two and a half centuries before, on the morning of <time datetime="1941-12-07">7 December, 1941</time>.</p>
				<p>“What,” Natalenko inquired, “do you think Machiavelli, Junior would do about the z’Srauff?”</p>
				<p>“We have a Department of Aggression,” I replied. “Its mottoes are, ‘Stop trouble before it starts,’ and, ‘If we have to fight, let’s do it on the other fellow’s real estate.’ But this situation is just a little too delicate for literal application of those principles. An unprovoked attack on the z’Srauff would set every other nonhuman race in the galaxy against us.⁠ ⁠… Would an attack by the z’Srauff on New Texas constitute just provocation?”</p>
				<p>“It might. New Texas is an independent planet. Its people are descendants of emigrants from Terra who wanted to get away from the rule of the Solar League. We’ve been trying for half a century to persuade the New Texan government to join the League. We need their planet, for both strategic and commercial reasons. With the z’Srauff for neighbors, they need us as much at least as we need them. The problem is to make them understand that.”</p>
				<p>I nodded again. “And an attack by the z’Srauff would do that, too, sir,” I said.</p>
				<p>Natalenko tittered again. “You see, gentlemen! Our <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk picks things up very handily, doesn’t he?” He turned to Secretary of State Ghopal. “You take it from there,” he invited.</p>
				<p>Ghopal Singh smiled benignly. “Well, that’s it, Stephen,” he said. “We need a man on New Texas who can get things done. Three things, to be exact.</p>
				<p>“First, find out why poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw was murdered, and what can be done about it to maintain our prestige without alienating the New Texans.</p>
				<p>“Second, bring the government and people of New Texas to a realization that they need the Solar League as much as we need them.</p>
				<p>“And, third, forestall or expose the plans for the z’Srauff invasion of New Texas.”</p>
				<p><q>Is that all, now?</q> I thought. <q>He doesn’t want a diplomat; he wants a magician.</q></p>
				<p>“And what,” I asked, “will my official position be on New Texas, sir? Or will I have one, of any sort?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, yes, indeed, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk. Your official position will be that of Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Envoy Extraordinary. That, I believe, is the only vacancy which exists in the Diplomatic Service on that planet.”</p>
				<p>At Dumbarton Oaks Diplomatic Academy, they haze the freshmen by making them sit on a one-legged stool and balance a teacup and saucer on one knee while the upper classmen pelt them with ping-pong balls. Whoever invented that and the other similar forms of hazing was one of the great geniuses of the Service. So I sipped my coffee, set down the cup, took a puff from my cigarette, then said:</p>
				<p>“I am indeed deeply honored, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Secretary. I trust I needn’t go into any assurances that I will do everything possible to justify your trust in me.”</p>
				<p>“I believe he will, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Secretary,” Natalenko piped, in a manner that chilled my blood.</p>
				<p>“Yes, I believe so,” Ghopal Singh said. “Now, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, there’s a liner in orbit two thousand miles off Luna, which has been held from blasting off for the last eight hours, waiting for you. Don’t bother packing more than a few things; you can get everything you’ll need aboard, or at New Austin, the planetary capital. We have a man whom Coordinator Natalenko has secured for us, a native New Texan, Hoddy Ringo by name. He’ll act as your personal secretary. He’s aboard the ship now. You’ll have to hurry, I’m afraid.⁠ ⁠… Well, bon voyage, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador.”</p>

			<section id="lone-star-planet-2" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">II</h3>
				<p>The deathwatch outside had grown to about fifteen or twenty. They were all waiting in happy anticipation as I came out of the Secretary’s office.</p>
				<p>“What did he do to you, Silk?” Courtlant Staynes asked, amusedly.</p>
				<p>“Demoted me. Kicked me off the Hooligan Diplomats,” I said glumly.</p>
				<p>“Demoted you from the Consular Service?” Staynes asked scornfully. “Impossible!”</p>
				<p>“Yes. He demoted me to the Cookie Pushers. Clear down to Ambassador.”</p>
				<p>They got a terrific laugh. I went out, wondering what sort of noises they’d make, the next morning, when the appointments sheet was posted.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>I gathered a few things together, mostly small personal items, and all the microfilms that I could find on New Texas, then got aboard the Space Navy cutter that was waiting to take me to the ship. It was a four-hour trip and I put in the time going over my hastily-assembled microfilm library and using a stenophone to dictate a reading list for the spacetrip.</p>
				<p>As I rolled up the stenophone-tape, I wondered what sort of secretary they had given me; and, in passing, why Natalenko’s department had furnished him.</p>
				<p>Hoddy Ringo.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>Queer name, but in a galactic civilization, you find all sorts of names and all sorts of people bearing them, so I was prepared for anything.</p>
				<p>And I found it.</p>
				<p>I found him standing with the ship’s captain, inside the airlock, when I boarded the big, spherical space-liner. A tubby little man, with shoulders and arms he had never developed doing secretarial work, and a good-natured, not particularly intelligent face.</p>
				<p><q>See the happy moron, he doesn’t give a damn</q>, I thought.</p>
				<p>Then I took a second look at him. He might be happy, but he wasn’t a moron. He just looked like one. Natalenko’s people often did, as one of their professional assets.</p>
				<p>I also noticed that he had a bulge under his left armpit the size of an eleven-<abbr>mm</abbr> army automatic.</p>
				<p>He was, I’d been told, a native of New Texas. I gathered, after talking with him for a while, that he had been away from his home planet for over five years, was glad to be going back, and especially glad that he was going back under the protection of Solar League diplomatic immunity.</p>
				<p>In fact, I rather got the impression that, without such protection, he wouldn’t have been going back at all.</p>
				<p>I made another discovery. My personal secretary, it seemed, couldn’t read stenotype. I found that out when I gave him the tape I’d dictated aboard the cutter, to transcribe for me.</p>
				<p>“Gosh, boss. I can’t make anything out of this stuff,” he confessed, looking at the combination shorthand-Braille that my voice had put onto the tape.</p>
				<p>“Well, then, put it in a player and transcribe it by ear,” I told him.</p>
				<p>He didn’t seem to realize that that could be done.</p>
				<p>“How did you come to be sent as my secretary, if you can’t do secretarial work?” I wanted to know.</p>
				<p>He got out a bag of tobacco and a book of papers and began rolling a cigarette, with one hand.</p>
				<p>“Why, shucks, boss, nobody seemed to think I’d have to do this kinda work,” he said. “I was just sent along to show you the way around New Texas, and see you don’t get inta no trouble.”</p>
				<p>He got his handmade cigarette drawing, and hitched the strap that went across his back and looped under his right arm. “A guy that don’t know the way around can get inta a lotta trouble on New Texas. If you call gettin’ killed trouble.”</p>
				<p>So he was a bodyguard⁠ ⁠… and I wondered what else he was. One thing, it would take him forty-two years to send a radio message back to Luna, and I could keep track of any other messages he sent, in letters or on tape, by ships. In the end, I transcribed my own tape, and settled down to laying out my three weeks’ study-course on my new post.</p>
				<p>I found, however, that the whole thing could be learned in a few hours. The rest of what I had was duplication, some of it contradictory, and it all boiled down to this:</p>
				<p>Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> had been settled during the first wave of extrasolar colonization, after the Fourth World⁠—or First Interplanetary⁠—War. Some time around 2100. The settlers had come from a place in North America called Texas, one of the old United States. They had a lengthy history⁠—independent republic, admission to the United States, secession from the United States, reconquest by the United States, and general intransigence under the United States, the United Nations and the Solar League. When the laws of non-Einsteinian physics were discovered and the hyperspace-drive was developed, practically the entire population of Texas had taken to space to find a new home and independence from everybody.</p>
				<p>They had found Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, a Terra-type planet, with a slightly higher mean temperature, a lower mass and lower gravitational field, about one-quarter water and three-quarters land-surface, at a stage of evolutionary development approximately that of Terra during the late Pliocene. They also found supercow, a big mammal looking like the unsuccessful attempt of a hippopotamus to impersonate a dachshund and about the size of a nuclear-steam locomotive. On New Texas’ plains, there were billions of them; their meat was fit for the gods of Olympus. So New Texas had become the meat-supplier to the galaxy.</p>
				<p>There was very little in any of the microfilm-books about the politics of New Texas and such as it was, it was very scornful. There were such expressions as “anarchy tempered by assassination,” and “grotesque parody of democracy.”</p>
				<p>There would, I assumed, be more exact information in the material which had been shoved into my hand just before boarding the cutter from Luna, in a package labeled <b>Top secret: To Be Opened Only in Space, after the First Hyperjump</b>. There was also a big trunk that had been placed in my suite, sealed and bearing the same instructions.</p>
				<p>I got Hoddy out of the suite as soon as the ship had passed out of the normal space-time continuum, locked the door of my cabin and opened the parcel.</p>
				<p>It contained only two looseleaf notebooks, both labeled with the Solar League and Department seals, both adorned with the customary bloodthirsty threats against the unauthorized and the indiscreet. They were numbered <b>One</b> and <b>Two</b>.</p>
				<p><b>One</b> contained four pages. On the first, I read:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<header role="presentation">
						<p>Final Message<br/>
						of the First Solar League Ambassador<br/>
						to<br/>
						New Texas<br/>
						Andrew Jackson Hickock</p>
					</header>
					<p>I agree with none of the so-called information about this planet on file with the State Department on Luna. The people of New Texas are certainly not uncouth barbarians. Their manners and customs, while lively and unconventional, are most charming. Their dress is graceful and practical, not grotesque; their soft speech is pleasing to the ear. Their flag is the original flag of the Republic of Texas; it is definitely not a barbaric travesty of our own emblem. And the underlying premises of their political system should, as far as possible, be incorporated into the organization of the Solar League. Here politics is an exciting and exacting game, in which only the true representative of all the people can survive.</p>
					<footer role="presentation">
						<p>Department Addendum</p>
						<p>After five years on New Texas, Andrew Jackson Hickock resigned, married a daughter of a local rancher and became a naturalized citizen of that planet. He is still active in politics there, often in opposition to Solar League policies.</p>
					</footer>
				</blockquote>
				<p>That didn’t sound like too bad an advertisement for the planet. I was even feeling cheerful when I turned to the next page, and:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<header role="presentation">
						<p>Final Message<br/>
						of the Second Solar League<br/>
						Ambassador to<br/>
						New Texas<br/>

					<footer role="presentation">
						<p>Department Addendum</p>
						<p>After seven years on New Texas, Ambassador Godwinson was recalled; adjudged hopelessly insane.</p>

				</blockquote>
				<p>And then:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<header role="presentation">

				<p>I turned to the last page cautiously, found:</p>

				</blockquote>
				<p>And that was the end of the first notebook. Nice, cheerful reading; complete, solid briefing.</p>
				<p>I was, frankly, almost afraid to open the second notebook. I hefted it cautiously at first, saw that it contained only about as many pages as the first and that those pages were sealed with a band around them.</p>
				<p>I took a quick peek, read the words on the band:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>Before reading, open the sealed trunk which has been included with your luggage.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>So I laid aside the book and dragged out the sealed trunk, hesitated, then opened it.</p>
				<p>Nothing shocked me more than to find the trunk⁠ ⁠… full of clothes.</p>
				<p>There were four pairs of trousers, light blue, dark blue, gray and black, with wide cuffs at the bottoms. There were six or eight shirts, their colors running the entire spectrum in the most violent shades. There were a couple of vests. There were two pairs of short boots with high heels and fancy leather-working, and a couple of hats with four-inch brims.</p>
				<p>And there was a wide leather belt, practically a leather corset.</p>
				<p>I stared at the belt, wondering if I was really seeing what was in front of me.</p>
				<p>Attached to the belt were a pair of pistols in right- and left-hand holsters. The pistols were seven-<abbr>mm</abbr> Krupp-Tatta Ultraspeed automatics, and the holsters were the spring-ejection, quick-draw holsters which were the secret of the State Department Special Services.</p>
				<p><q>This must be a mistake</q>, I thought. <q>I’m an Ambassador now and Ambassadors never carry weapons.</q></p>
				<p>The sanctity of an Ambassador’s person not only made the carrying of weapons unnecessary, so that an armed Ambassador was a contradiction of diplomatic terms, but it would be an outrageous insult to the nation to which he had been accredited.</p>
				<p>Like taking a poison-taster to a friendly dinner.</p>
				<p>Maybe I was supposed to give the belt and the holsters to Hoddy Ringo.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>So I tore the sealed band off the second notebook and read through it.</p>
				<p>I was to wear the local costume on New Texas. That was something unusual; even in the Hooligan Diplomats, we leaned over backward in wearing Terran costume to distinguish ourselves from the people among whom we worked.</p>
				<p>I was further advised to start wearing the high boots immediately, on shipboard, to accustom myself to the heels. These, I was informed, were traditional. They had served a useful purpose, in the early days on Terran Texas, when all travel had been on horseback. On horseless and mechanized New Texas, they were a useless but venerated part of the cultural heritage.</p>
				<p>There were bits of advice about the hat, and the trousers, which for some obscure reason were known as Levis. And I was informed, as an order, that I was to wear the belt and the pistols at all times outside the Embassy itself.</p>
				<p>That was all of the second notebook.</p>
				<p>The two notebooks, plus my conversation with Ghopal, Klüng and Natalenko, completed my briefing for my new post.</p>
				<p>I slid off my shoes and pulled on a pair of boots. They fitted perfectly. Evidently I had been tapped for this job as soon as word of Silas Cumshaw’s death had reached Luna and there must have been some fantastic hurrying to get my outfit ready.</p>
				<p>I didn’t like that any too well, and I liked the order to carry the pistols even less. Not that I had any objection to carrying weapons, per se: I had been born and raised on Theta Virgo <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, where the children aren’t allowed outside the house unattended until they’ve learned to shoot.</p>
				<p>But I did have strenuous objections to being sent, virtually ignorant of local customs, on a mission where I was ordered to commit deliberate provocation of the local government, immediately on the heels of my predecessor’s violent death.</p>
				<p>The author of “Probable Future Courses of Solar League Diplomacy” had recommended the use of provocation to justify conquest. If the New Texans murdered two Solar League Ambassadors in a row, nobody would blame the League for moving in with a space-fleet and an army.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>I was beginning to understand how Doctor Guillotin must have felt while his neck was being shoved into his own invention.</p>
				<p>I looked again at the notebooks, each marked in red: <em>Familiarize yourself with contents and burn or disintegrate.</em></p>
				<p>I’d have to do that, of course. There were a few nonhumans and a lot of non-League people aboard this ship. I couldn’t let any of them find out what we considered a full briefing for a new Ambassador.</p>
				<p>So I wrapped them in the original package and went down to the lower passenger zone, where I found the ship’s third officer. I told him that I had some secret diplomatic matter to be destroyed and he took me to the engine room. I shoved the package into one of the mass-energy convertors and watched it resolve itself into its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons.</p>
				<p>On the way back, I stopped in at the ship’s bar.</p>
				<p>Hoddy Ringo was there, wrapped up in⁠—and I use the words literally⁠—a young lady from the Alderbaran system. She was on her way home from one of the quickie divorce courts on Terra and was celebrating her marital emancipation. They were so entangled with each other that they didn’t notice me. When they left the bar, I slipped after them until I saw them enter the lady’s stateroom. That, of course, would have Hoddy immobilized⁠—better word, located⁠—for a while. So I went back to our suite, picked the lock of Hoddy’s room, and allowed myself half an hour to search his luggage.</p>
				<p>All of his clothes were new, but there were not a great many of them. Evidently he was planning to re-outfit himself on New Texas. There were a few odds and ends, the kind any man with a real home planet will hold on to, in the luggage.</p>
				<p>He had another eleven-<abbr>mm</abbr> pistol, made by Consolidated-Martian Metalworks, mate to the one he was carrying in a shoulder-holster, and a wide two-holster belt like the one furnished me, but quite old.</p>
				<p>I greeted the sight and the meaning of the old holsters with joy: they weren’t the State Department Special Services type. That meant that Hoddy was just one of Natalenko’s run-of-the-gallows cutthroats, not important enough to be issued the secret equipment.</p>
				<p>But I was a little worried over what I found hidden in the lining of one of his bags, a letter addressed to Space-Commander Lucius <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Stonehenge, Aggression Department Attaché, New Austin Embassy. I didn’t have either the time or the equipment to open it. But, knowing our various Departments, I tried to reassure myself with the thought that it was only a letter-of-credence, with the real message to be delivered orally.</p>
				<p>About the real message I had no doubts: <q>arrange the murder of Ambassador Stephen Silk in such a way that it looks like another New Texan job.⁠ ⁠…</q></p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Starting that evening⁠—or what passed for evening aboard a ship in hyperspace⁠—Hoddy and I began a positively epochal binge together.</p>
				<p>I had it figured this way: as long as we were on board ship, I was perfectly safe. On the ship, in fact, Hoddy would definitely have given his life to save mine. I’d have to be killed on New Texas to give Klüng’s boys their excuse for moving in.</p>
				<p>And there was always the chance, with no chance too slender for me to ignore, that I might be able to get Hoddy drunk enough to talk, yet still be sober enough myself to remember what he said.</p>
				<p>Exact times, details, faces, names, came to me through a sort of hazy blur as Hoddy and I drank something he called superbourbon⁠—a New Texan drink that Bourbon County, Kentucky, would never have recognized. They had no corn on New Texas. This stuff was made out of something called superyams.</p>
				<p>There were at least two things I got out of the binge. First, I learned to slug down the national drink without batting an eye. Second, I learned to control my expression as I uncovered the fact that everything on New Texas was supersomething.</p>
				<p>I was also cautious enough, before we really got started, to leave my belt and guns with the purser. I didn’t want Hoddy poking around those secret holsters. And I remember telling the captain to radio New Austin as soon as we came out of our last hyperspace-jump, then to send the ship’s doctor around to give me my hangover treatments.</p>
				<p>But the one thing I wanted to remember, as the hangover shots brought me back to normal life, I found was the one thing I couldn’t remember. What was the name of that girl⁠—a big, beautiful blond⁠—who joined the party along with Hoddy’s grass widow from Alderbaran and stayed with it to the end?</p>
				<p>Damn, I wished I could remember her name!</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>When we were fifteen thousand miles off-planet and the lighters from New Austin spaceport were reported on the way, I got into the skintight Levis, the cataclysmic-colored shirt, and the loose vest, tucked my big hat under my arm, and went to the purser’s office for my guns, buckling them on. When I got back to the suite, Hoddy had put on his pistols and was practicing quick draws in front of the mirror. He took one look at my armament and groaned.</p>
				<p>“You’re gonna get yourself killed for sure, with that rig, an’ them popguns,” he told me.</p>
				<p>“These popguns’ll shoot harder and make bigger holes than that pair of museum-pieces you’re carrying,” I replied.</p>
				<p>“An’ them holsters!” Hoddy continued. “Why, it’d take all day to get your guns outa them! You better let me find you a real rig, when we get to New Austin.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>There was a chance, of course, that he knew what I was using and wanted to hide his knowledge. I doubted that.</p>
				<p>“Sure, you State Department guys always know everything,” he went on. “Like them microfilm-books you was readin.’ I try to tell you what things is really like on New Texas, an’ you let it go in one ear an’ out the other.”</p>
				<p>Then he wandered off to say goodbye to the grass widow from Alderbaran, leaving me to make the last-minute check on the luggage. I was hoping I’d be able to see that blond⁠ ⁠… what <em>was</em> her name; Gail something-or-other. Let’s see, she’d been at some Terran university, and she was on her way home to⁠ ⁠… to New Texas! Of course!</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>I saw her, half an hour later, in the crowd around the airlock when the lighters came alongside, and I tried to push my way toward her. As I did, the airlock opened, the crowd surged toward it, and she was carried along. Then the airlock closed, after she had passed through and before I could get to it. That meant I’d have to wait for the second lighter.</p>
				<p>So I made the best of it, and spent the next half-hour watching the disc of the planet grow into a huge ball that filled the lower half of the viewscreen and then lose its curvature, and instead of moving in toward the planet, we were going down toward it.</p>
			</section>
			<section id="lone-star-planet-3" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">III</h3>
				<p>New Austin spaceport was a huge place, a good fifty miles outside the city. As we descended, I could see that it was laid out like a wheel, with the landings and the blastoff stands around the hub, and high buildings⁠—packing houses and refrigeration plants⁠—along the many spokes. It showed a technological level quite out of keeping with the accounts I had read, or the stories Hoddy had told, about the simple ranch life of the planet. Might be foreign capital invested there, and I made a mental note to find out whose.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, Old Texas, on Terra, had been heavily industrialized; so much so that the state itself could handle the gigantic project of building enough spaceships to move almost the whole population into space.</p>
				<p>Then the landing-field was rushing up at us, with the nearer ends of the roadways and streets drawing close and the far ends lengthening out away from us. The other lighter was already down, and I could see a crowd around it.</p>
				<p>There was a crowd waiting for us when we got out and went down the escalators to the ground, and as I had expected, a special group of men waiting for me. They were headed by a tall, slender individual in the short black Eisenhower jacket, gray-striped trousers and black homburg that was the uniform of the Diplomatic Service, alias the Cookie Pushers.</p>
				<p>Over their heads at the other rocket-boat, I could see the gold-gleaming head of the girl I’d met on the ship.</p>
				<p>I tried to push through the crowd and get to her. As I did, the Cookie Pusher got in my way.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador! Here we are!” he was clamoring. “The car for the Embassy is right over here!” He clutched my elbow. “You have no idea how glad we all are to see you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador!”</p>
				<p>“Yes, yes; of course. Now, there’s somebody over there I have to see, at once.” I tried to pull myself loose from his grasp.</p>
				<p>Across the concrete between the two lighters, I could see the girl push out of the crowd around her and wave a hand to me. I tried to yell to her; but just then another lighter, loaded with freight, started to lift out at another nearby stand, with the roar of half a dozen Niagaras. The thin man in the striped trousers added to the uproar by shouting into my ear and pulling at me.</p>
				<p>“We haven’t time!” he finally managed to make himself heard. “We’re dreadfully late now, sir! You must come with us.”</p>
				<p>Hoddy, too, had caught hold of me by the other arm.</p>
				<p>“Come on, boss. There’s gotta be some reason why he’s got himself in an uproar about whatever it is. You’ll see her again.”</p>
				<p>Then, the whole gang⁠—Hoddy, the thin man with the black homburg, his younger accomplice in identical garb, and the chauffeur⁠—all closed in on me and pushed me, pulled me, half-carried me, fifty yards across the concrete to where their aircar was parked. By this time, the tall blond had gotten clear of the mob around her and was waving frantically at me. I tried to wave back, but I was literally crammed into the car and flung down on the seat. At the same time, the chauffeur was jumping in, extending the car’s wings, jetting up.</p>
				<p>“Great God!” I bellowed. “This is the damnedest piece of impudence I’ve ever had to suffer from any subordinates in my whole State Department experience! I want an explanation out of you, and it’d better be a good one!”</p>
				<p>There was a deafening silence in the car for a moment. The thin man moved himself off my lap, then sat there looking at me with the heartbroken eyes of a friendly dog that had just been kicked for something which wasn’t really its fault.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, you can’t imagine how sorry we all are, but if we hadn’t gotten you away from the spaceport and to the Embassy at once, we would all have been much sorrier.”</p>
				<p>“Somebody here gunnin’ for the Ambassador?” Hoddy demanded sharply.</p>
				<p>“Oh, no! I hadn’t even thought of that,” the thin man almost gibbered. “But your presence at the Embassy is of immediate and urgent necessity. You have no idea of the state into which things have gotten.⁠ ⁠… Oh, pardon me, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador. I am Gilbert <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Thrombley, your chargé d’affaires.” I shook hands with him. “And <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Benito Gomez, the Secretary of the Embassy.” I shook hands with him, too, and started to introduce <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hoddy Ringo.</p>
				<p>Hoddy, however, had turned to look out the rear window; immediately, he gave a yelp.</p>
				<p>“We got a tail, boss! Two of them! Look back there!”</p>
				<p>There were two black eight-passenger aircars, of the same model, whizzing after us, making an obvious effort to overtake us. The chauffeur cursed and fired his auxiliary jets, then his rocket-booster.</p>
				<p>Immediately, black rocket-fuel puffs shot away from the pursuing aircars.</p>
				<p>Hoddy turned in his seat, cranked open a porthole-slit in the window, and poked one of his eleven-<abbr>mm</abbr>’s out, letting the whole clip go. Thrombley and Gomez slid down onto the floor, and both began trying to drag me down with them, imploring me not to expose myself.</p>
				<p>As far as I could see, there was nothing to expose myself to. The other cars kept coming, but neither of them were firing at us. There was also no indication that Hoddy’s salvo had had any effect on them. Our chauffeur went into a perfect frenzy of twisting and dodging, at the same time using his radiophone to tell somebody to get the goddamn gate open in a hurry. I saw the blue skies and green plains of New Texas replacing one another above, under, in front of and behind us. Then the car set down on a broad stretch of concrete, the wings were retracted, and we went whizzing down a city street.</p>
				<p>We whizzed down a number of streets. We cut corners on two wheels, and on one wheel, and, I was prepared to swear, on no wheels. A couple of times, with the wings retracted, we actually jetted into the air and jumped over vehicles in front of us, landing again with bone-shaking jolts. Then we made an abrupt turn and shot in under a concrete arch, and a big door banged shut behind us, and we stopped, in the middle of a wide patio, the front of the car a few inches short of a fountain. Four or five people, in diplomatic striped trousers, local dress and the uniform of the Space Marines, came running over.</p>
				<p>Thrombley pulled himself erect and half-climbed, half-fell, out of the car. Gomez got out on the other side with Hoddy; I climbed out after Thrombley.</p>
				<p>A tall, sandy-haired man in the uniform of the Space Navy came over.</p>
				<p>“What the devil’s the matter, Thrombley?” he demanded. Then, seeing me, he gave me as much of a salute as a naval officer will ever bestow on anybody in civilian clothes.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk?” He looked at my costume and the pistols on my belt in well-bred concealment of surprise. “I’m your military attaché, Stonehenge; Space-Commander, Space Navy.”</p>
				<p>I noticed that Hoddy’s ears had pricked up, but he wasn’t making any effort to attract Stonehenge’s attention. I shook hands with him, introduced Hoddy, and offered my cigarette case around.</p>
				<p>“You seem to have had a hectic trip from the spaceport, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador. What happened?”</p>
				<p>Thrombley began accusing our driver of trying to murder the lot of us. Hoddy brushed him aside and explained:</p>
				<p>“Just after we’d took off, two other cars took off after us. We speeded up, and they speeded up, too. Then your fly-boy, here, got fancy. That shook ’em off. Time we got into the city, we’d dropped them. Nice job of driving. Probably saved our lives.”</p>
				<p>“Shucks, that wasn’t nothin,’ ” the driver disclaimed. “When you drive for politicians, you’re either good or you’re good and dead.”</p>
				<p>“I’m surprised they started so soon,” Stonehenge said. Then he looked around at my fellow-passengers, who seemed to have realized, by now, that they were no longer dangling by their fingernails over the brink of the grave. “But gentlemen, let’s not keep the Ambassador standing out here in the hot sun.”</p>
				<p>So we went over the arches at the side of the patio, and were about to sit down when one of the Embassy servants came up, followed by a man in a loose vest and blue Levis and a big hat. He had a pair of automatics in his belt, too.</p>
				<p>“I’m Captain Nelson; New Texas Rangers,” he introduced himself. “Which one of you-all is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen Silk?”</p>
				<p>I admitted it.</p>
				<p>The Ranger pushed back his wide hat and grinned at me.</p>
				<p>“I just can’t figure this out,” he said. “You’re in the right place and the right company, but we got a report, from a mighty good source, that you’d been kidnapped at the spaceport by a gang of thugs!”</p>
				<p>“A blond source?” I made curving motions with my hands. “I don’t blame her. My efficient and conscientious chargé d’affaires, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley, felt that I should reach the Embassy, here, as soon as possible, and from where she was standing, it must have looked like a kidnapping. Fact is, it looked like one from where I was standing, too. Was that you and your people who were chasing us? Then I must apologize for opening fire on you.⁠ ⁠… I hope nobody was hurt.”</p>
				<p>“No, our cars are pretty well armored. You scored a couple of times on one of them, but no harm done. I reckon after what happened to Silas Cumshaw, you had a right to be suspicious.”</p>
				<p>I noticed that refreshments, including several bottles, had been placed on a big wicker table under the arched veranda.</p>
				<p>“Can I offer you a drink, Captain, in token of mutual amity?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Well, now, I’d like to, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, but I’m on duty.⁠ ⁠…” he began.</p>
				<p>“You can’t be. You’re an officer of the Planetary Government of New Texas, and in this Embassy, you’re in the territory of the Solar League.”</p>
				<p>“That’s right, now, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” he grinned. “Extraterritoriality. Wonderful thing, extraterritoriality.” He looked at Hoddy, who, for the first time since I had met him, was trying to shrink into the background. “And diplomatic immunity, too. Ain’t it, Hoddy?”</p>
				<p>After he had had his drink and departed, we all sat down. Thrombley began speaking almost at once.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, you must, you simply must, issue a public statement, immediately, sir. Only a public statement, issued promptly, will relieve the crisis into which we have all been thrust.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, come, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley,” I objected. “Captain Nelson’ll take care of all that in his report to his superiors.”</p>
				<p>Thrombley looked at me for a moment as though I had been speaking to him in Hottentot, then waved his hands in polite exasperation.</p>
				<p>“Oh, no, no! I don’t mean that, sir. I mean a public statement to the effect that you have assumed full responsibility for the Embassy. Where is that thing? <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gomez!”</p>
				<p>Gomez gave him four or five sheets, stapled together. He laid them on the table, turned to the last sheet, and whipped out a pen.</p>
				<p>“Here, sir; just sign here.”</p>
				<p>“Are you crazy?” I demanded. “I’ll be damned if I’ll sign that. Not till I’ve taken an inventory of the physical property of the Embassy, and familiarized myself with all its commitments, and had the books audited by some firm of certified public accountants.”</p>
				<p>Thrombley and Gomez looked at one another. They both groaned.</p>
				<p>“But we must have a statement of assumption of responsibility.⁠ ⁠…” Gomez dithered.</p>
				<p>“… or the business of the Embassy will be at a dead stop, and we can’t do anything,” Thrombley finished.</p>
				<p>“Wait a moment, Thrombley,” Stonehenge cut in. “I understand <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk’s attitude. I’ve taken command of a good many ships and installations, at one time or another, and I’ve never signed for anything I couldn’t see and feel and count. I know men who retired as brigadier generals or vice-admirals, but they retired loaded with debts incurred because as second lieutenants or ensigns they forgot that simple rule.”</p>
				<p>He turned to me. “Without any disrespect to the chargé d’affaires, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk, this Embassy has been pretty badly disorganized since <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw’s death. No one felt authorized, or, to put it more accurately, no one dared, to declare himself acting head of the Embassy⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Because that would make him the next target?” I interrupted. “Well, that’s what I was sent here for. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gomez, as Secretary of the Embassy, will you please, at once, prepare a statement for the press and telecast release to the effect that I am now the authorized head of this Embassy, responsible from this hour for all its future policies and all its present commitments insofar as they obligate the government of the Solar League. Get that out at once. Tomorrow, I will present my credentials to the Secretary of State here. Thereafter, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley, you can rest in the assurance that I’ll be the one they’ll be shooting at.”</p>
				<p>“But you can’t wait that long, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” Thrombley almost wailed. “We must go immediately to the Statehouse. The reception for you is already going on.”</p>
				<p>I looked at my watch, which had been regulated aboard ship for Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> time. It was just 1315.</p>
				<p>“What time do they hold diplomatic receptions on this planet, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Oh, any time at all, sir. This one started about 0900 when the news that the ship was in orbit off-planet got in. It’ll be a barbecue, of course, and⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Barbecued supercow! Yipeee!” Hoddy yelled. “What I been waitin’ for for five years!”</p>
				<p>It would be the vilest cruelty not to take him along, I thought. And it would also keep him and Stonehenge apart for a while.</p>
				<p>“But we must hurry, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” Thrombley was saying. “If you will change, now, to formal dress.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>And he was looking at me, gasping. I think it was the first time he had actually seen what I was wearing.</p>
				<p>“In native dress, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador!”</p>
				<p>Thrombley’s eyes and tone were again those of an innocent spaniel caught in the middle of a marital argument.</p>
				<p>Then his gaze fell to my belt and his eyes became saucers. “Oh, dear! And armed!”</p>
				<p>My chargé d’affaires was shuddering and he could not look directly at me.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, I understand that you were recently appointed from the Consular Service. I sincerely hope that you will not take it amiss if I point out, here in private, that⁠—”</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley, I am wearing this costume and these pistols on the direct order of Secretary of State Ghopal Singh.”</p>
				<p>That set him back on his heels.</p>
				<p>“.⁠ ⁠… I can’t believe it!” he exclaimed. “An ambassador is <em>never</em> armed.”</p>
				<p>“Not when he’s dealing with a government which respects the comity of nations and the usages of diplomatic practice, no,” I replied. “But the fate of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw clearly indicates that the government of New Texas is not such a government. These pistols are in the nature of a not-too-subtle hint of the manner in which this government, here, is being regarded by the government of the Solar League.” I turned to Stonehenge. “Commander, what sort of an Embassy guard have we?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Space Marines, sergeant and five men. I double as guard officer, sir.”</p>
				<p>“Very well. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley insists that it is necessary for me to go to this fish-fry or whatever it is immediately. I want two men, a driver and an auto-rifleman, for my car. And from now on, I would suggest, Commander, that you wear your sidearm at all times outside the Embassy.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, sir!” and this time, Stonehenge gave me a real salute.</p>
				<p>“Well, I must phone the Statehouse, then,” Thrombley said. “We will have to call on Secretary of State Palme, and then on President Hutchinson.”</p>
				<p>With that, he got up, excused himself, motioned Gomez to follow, and hurried away.</p>
				<p>I got up, too, and motioned Stonehenge aside.</p>
				<p>“Aboard ship, coming in, I was told that there’s a task force of the Space Navy on maneuvers about five light-years from here,” I said.</p>
				<p>“Yes, sir. Task Force Red-Blue-Green, Fifth Space Fleet. Fleet Admiral Sir Rodney Tregaskis.”</p>
				<p>“Can we get hold of a fast space-boat, with hyperdrive engines, in a hurry?”</p>
				<p>“Eight or ten of them always around New Austin spaceport, available for charter.”</p>
				<p>“All right; charter one and get out to that fleet. Tell Admiral Tregaskis that the Ambassador at New Austin feels in need of protection; possibility of z’Srauff invasion. I’ll give you written orders. I want the Fleet within radio call. How far out would that be, with our facilities?”</p>
				<p>“The Embassy radio isn’t reliable beyond about sixty light-minutes, sir.”</p>
				<p>“Then tell Sir Rodney to bring his fleet in that close. The invasion, if it comes, will probably not come from the direction of the z’Srauff star-cluster; they’ll probably jump past us and move in from the other side. I hope you don’t think I’m having nightmares, Commander. Danger of a z’Srauff invasion was pointed out to me by persons on the very highest level, on Luna.”</p>
				<p>Stonehenge nodded. “I’m always having the same kind of nightmares, sir. Especially since this special envoy arrived here, ostensibly to negotiate a meteor-mining treaty.” He hesitated for a moment. “We don’t want the New Texans to know, of course, that you’ve sent for the fleet?”</p>
				<p>“Naturally not.”</p>
				<p>“Well, if I can wait till about midnight before I leave, I can get a boat owned, manned and operated by Solar League people. The boat’s a dreadful-looking old tub, but she’s sound and fast. The gang who own her are pretty notorious characters⁠—suspected of smuggling, piracy, and whatnot⁠—but they’ll keep their mouths shut if well paid.”</p>
				<p>“Then pay them well,” I said. “And it’s just as well you’re not leaving at once. When I get back from this clambake, I’ll want to have a general informal council, and I certainly want you in on it.”</p>
				<p>On the way to the Statehouse in the aircar, I kept wondering just how smart I had been.</p>
				<p>I was pretty sure that the z’Srauff was getting ready for a sneak attack on New Texas, and, as Solar League Ambassador, I of course had the right to call on the Space Navy for any amount of armed protection.</p>
				<p>Sending Stonehenge off on what couldn’t be less than an eighteen-hour trip would delay anything he and Hoddy might be cooking up, too.</p>
				<p>On the other hand, with the fleet so near, they might decide to have me rubbed out in a hurry, to justify seizing the planet ahead of the z’Srauff.</p>
				<p>I was in that pleasant spot called, “Damned if you do and damned if you don’t.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			</section>
			<section id="lone-star-planet-4" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">IV</h3>
				<p>The Statehouse appeared to cover about a square mile of ground and it was an insane jumble of buildings piled beside and on top of one another, as though it had been in continuous construction ever since the planet was colonized, eighty-odd years before.</p>
				<p>At what looked like one of the main entrances, the car stopped. I told our Marine driver and auto-rifleman to park the car and take in the barbecue, but to leave word with the doorman where they could be found. Hoddy, Thrombley and I then went in, to be met by a couple of New Texas Rangers, one of them the officer who had called at the Embassy. They guided us to the office of the Secretary of State.</p>
				<p>“We’re dreadfully late,” Thrombley was fretting. “I do hope we haven’t kept the Secretary waiting too long.”</p>
				<p>From the looks of him, I was afraid we had. He jumped up from his desk and hurried across the room as soon as the receptionist opened the door for us, his hand extended.</p>
				<p>“Good afternoon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley,” he burbled nervously. “And this is the new Ambassador, I suppose. And this⁠—” He caught sight of Hoddy Ringo, bringing up the rear and stopped short, hand flying to open mouth. “Oh, dear me!”</p>
				<p>So far, I had been building myself a New Texas stereotype from Hoddy Ringo and the Ranger officer who had chased us to the Embassy. But this frightened little rabbit of a fellow simply didn’t fit it. An alien would be justified in assigning him to an entirely different species.</p>
				<p>Thrombley introduced me. I introduced Hoddy as my confidential secretary and advisor. We all shook hands, and Thrombley dug my credentials out of his briefcase and handed them to me, and I handed them to the Secretary of State, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Palme. He barely glanced at them, then shook my hand again fervently and mumbled something about “inexpressible pleasure” and “entirely acceptable to my government.”</p>
				<p>That made me the accredited and accepted Ambassador to New Texas.</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Palme hoped, or said he hoped, that my stay in New Texas would be long and pleasant. He seemed rather less than convinced that it would be. His eyes kept returning in horrified fascination to my belt. Each time they would focus on the butts of my Krupp-Tattas, he would pull them resolutely away again.</p>
				<p>“And now, we must take you to President Hutchinson; he is most anxious to meet you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk. If you will please come with me.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>Four or five Rangers who had been loitering the hall outside moved to follow us as we went toward the elevator. Although we had come into the building onto a floor only a few feet above street-level, we went down three floors from the hallway outside the Secretary of State’s office, into a huge room, the concrete floor of which was oil-stained, as though vehicles were continually being driven in and out. It was about a hundred feet wide, and two or three hundred in length. Daylight was visible through open doors at the end. As we approached them, the Rangers fanning out on either side and in front of us, I could hear a perfect bedlam of noise outside⁠—shouting, singing, dance-band music, interspersed with the banging of shots.</p>
				<p>When we reached the doors at the end, we emerged into one end of a big rectangular plaza, at least five hundred yards in length. Most of the uproar was centered at the opposite end, where several thousand people, in costumes colored through the whole spectrum, were milling about. There seemed to be at least two square-dances going on, to the music of competing bands. At the distant end of the plaza, over the heads of the crowd, I could see the piles and tracks of an overhead crane, towering above what looked like an open-hearth furnace. Between us and the bulk of the crowd, in a cleared space, two medium tanks, heavily padded with mats, were ramming and trying to overturn each other, the mob of spectators crowding as close to them as they dared. The din was positively deafening, though we were at least two hundred yards from the center of the crowd.</p>
				<p>“Oh, dear, I always dread these things!” Palme was saying.</p>
				<p>“Yes, absolutely anything could happen,” Thrombley twittered.</p>
				<p>“Man, this is a real barbecue!” Hoddy gloated. “Now I really feel at home!”</p>
				<p>“Over this way, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Palme said, guiding me toward the short end of the plaza, on our left. “We will see the President and then.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>He gulped.</p>
				<p>“… then we will all go to the barbecue.”</p>
				<p>In the center of the short end of the plaza, dwarfed by the monster bulks of steel and concrete and glass around it, stood a little old building of warm-tinted adobe. I had never seen it before, but somehow it was familiar-looking. And then I remembered. Although I had never seen it before, I had seen it pictured many times; pictured under attack, with gunsmoke spouting from windows and parapets.</p>
				<p>I plucked Thrombley’s sleeve.</p>
				<p>“Isn’t that a replica of the Alamo?”</p>
				<p>He was shocked. “Oh, dear, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, don’t let anybody hear you ask that. That’s no replica. It <em>is</em> the Alamo. <em>The</em> Alamo.”</p>
				<p>I stood there a moment, looking at it. I was remembering, and finally understanding, what my psycho-history lessons about the “Romantic Freeze” had meant.</p>
				<p><em>They had taken this little mission-fort down, brick by adobe brick, loaded it carefully into a spaceship, brought it here, forty two light-years away from Terra, and reverently set it up again. Then they had built a whole world and a whole social philosophy around it</em>.</p>
				<p>It had been the dissatisfied, of course, the discontented, the dreamers, who had led the vanguard of man’s explosion into space following the discovery of the hyperspace-drive. They had gone from Terra cherishing dreams of things that had been dumped into the dust bin of history, carrying with them pictures of ways of life that had passed away, or that had never really been. Then, in their new life, on new planets, they had set to work making those dreams and those pictures live.</p>
				<p>And, many times, they had come close to succeeding.</p>
				<p>These Texans, now: they had left behind the cold fact that it had been their state’s great industrial complex that had made their migration possible. They ignored the fact that their life here on Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> was possible only by application of modern industrial technology. That rodeo down the plaza⁠—tank-tilting instead of bronco-busting. Here they were, living frozen in a romantic dream, a world of roving cowboys and ranch kingdoms.</p>
				<p>No wonder Hoddy hadn’t liked the books I had been reading on the ship. They shook the fabric of that dream.</p>
				<p>There were people moving about, at this relatively quiet end of the plaza, mostly in the direction of the barbecue. Ten or twelve Rangers loitered at the front of the Alamo, and with them I saw the dress blues of my two Marines. There was a little three-wheeled motorcart among them, from which they were helping themselves to food and drink. When they saw us coming, the two Marines shoved their sandwiches into the hands of a couple of Rangers and tried to come to attention.</p>
				<p>“At ease, at ease,” I told them. “Have a good time, boys. Hoddy, you better get in on some of this grub; I may be inside for quite a while.”</p>
				<p>As soon as the Rangers saw Hoddy, they hastily got things out of their right hands. Hoddy grinned at them.</p>
				<p>“Take it easy, boys,” he said. “I’m protected by the game laws. I’m a diplomat, I am.”</p>
				<p>There were a couple of Rangers lounging outside the door of the President’s office and both of them carried autorifles, implying things I didn’t like.</p>
				<p>I had seen the President of the Solar League wandering around the dome-city of Artemis unattended, looking for all the world like a professor in his academic halls. Since then, maybe before then, I had always had a healthy suspicion of governments whose chiefs had to surround themselves with bodyguards.</p>
				<p>But the President of New Texas, John Hutchinson, was alone in his office when we were shown in. He got up and came around his desk to greet us, a slender, stoop-shouldered man in a black-and-gold laced jacket. He had a narrow compressed mouth and eyes that seemed to be watching every corner of the room at once. He wore a pair of small pistols in crossbody holsters under his coat, and he always kept one hand or the other close to his abdomen.</p>
				<p>He was like, and yet unlike, the Secretary of State. Both had the look of hunted animals; but where Palme was a rabbit, twitching to take flight at the first whiff of danger, Hutchinson was a cat who hears hounds baying⁠—ready to run if he could, or claw if he must.</p>
				<p>“Good day, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” he said, shaking hands with me after the introductions. “I see you’re heeled; you’re smart. You wouldn’t be here today if poor Silas Cumshaw’d been as smart as you are. Great man, though; a wise and farseeing statesman. He and I were real friends.”</p>
				<p>“You know who <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk brought with him as bodyguard?” Palme asked. “Hoddy Ringo!”</p>
				<p>“Oh, my God! I thought this planet was rid of him!” The President turned to me. “You got a good trigger-man, though, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador. Good man to watch your back for you. But lot of folks here won’t thank you for bringing him back to New Texas.”</p>
				<p>He looked at his watch. “We have time for a little drink, before we go outside, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” he said. “Care to join me?”</p>
				<p>I assented and he got a bottle of superbourbon out of his desk, with four glasses. Palme got some water tumblers and brought the pitcher of ice-water from the cooler.</p>
				<p>I noticed that the New Texas Secretary of State filled his three-ounce liquor glass to the top and gulped it down at once. He might act as though he were descended from a long line of maiden aunts, but he took his liquor in blasts that would have floored a spaceport labor-boss.</p>
				<p>We had another drink, a little slower, and chatted for a while, and then Hutchinson said, regretfully that we’d have to go outside and meet the folks. Outside, our guards⁠—Hoddy, the two Marines, the Rangers who had escorted us from Palme’s office, and Hutchinson’s retinue⁠—surrounded us, and we made our way down the plaza, through the crowd. The din⁠—ear-piercing yells, whistles, cowbells, pistol shots, the cacophony of the two dance-bands, and the chorus-singing, of which I caught only the words: <q>The skies of freedom are above you!</q>⁠—was as bad as New Year’s Eve in Manhattan or Nairobi or New Moscow, on Terra.</p>
				<p>“Don’t take all this as a personal tribute, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk!” Hutchinson screamed into my ear. “On this planet, to paraphrase Nietzsche, a good barbecue halloweth any cause!”</p>
				<p>That surprised me, at the moment. Later I found out that John Hutchinson was one of the leading scholars on New Texas and had once been president of one of their universities. New Texas Christian, I believe.</p>
				<p>As we got up onto the platform, close enough to the barbecue pits to feel the heat from them, somebody let off what sounded like a fifty-<abbr>mm</abbr> antitank gun five or six times. Hutchinson grabbed a microphone and bellowed into it: “Ladies and gentlemen! Your attention, please!”</p>
				<p>The noise began to diminish, slowly, until I could hear one voice, in the crowd below:</p>
				<p>“Shut up, you damn fools! We can’t eat till this is over!”</p>
				<p>Hutchinson introduced me, in very few words. I gathered that lengthy speeches at barbecues were not popular on New Texas.</p>
				<p>“Ladies and gentlemen!” I yelled into the microphone. “Appreciative as I am of this honor, there is one here who is more deserving of your notice than I; one to whom I, also, pay homage. He’s over there on the fire, and I want a slice of him as soon as possible!”</p>
				<p>That got a big ovation. There was, beside the water pitcher, a bottle of superbourbon. I ostentatiously threw the water out of the glass, poured a big shot of the corrosive stuff, and downed it.</p>
				<p>“For God’s sake, let’s eat!” I finished. Then I turned to Thrombley, who was looking like a priest who has just seen the bishop spit in the holy-water font. “Stick close to me,” I whispered. “Cue me in on the local notables, and the other members of the Diplomatic Corps.” Then we all got down off the platform, and a band climbed up and began playing one of those raucous “cowboy ballads” which had originated in Manhattan about the middle of the Twentieth Century.</p>
				<p>“The sandwiches’ll be here in a moment, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” Hutchinson screamed⁠—in effect, whispered⁠—in my ear. “Don’t feel any reluctance about shaking hands with a sandwich in your other hand; that’s standard practice, here. You struck just the right note, up there. That business with the liquor was positively inspired!”</p>
				<p>The sandwiches⁠—huge masses of meat and hot relish, wrapped in tortillas of some sort⁠—arrived and I bit into one.</p>
				<p>I’d been eating supercow all my life, frozen or electron-beamed for transportation, and now I was discovering that I had never really eaten supercow before. I finished the first sandwich in surprisingly short order and was starting on my second when the crowd began coming.</p>
				<p>First, the Diplomatic Corps, the usual collection of weirdies, human and otherwise.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>There was the Ambassador from Tara, in a suit of what his planet produced as a substitute for Irish homespuns. His Embassy, if it was like the others I had seen elsewhere, would be an outsize cottage with whitewashed walls and a thatched roof, with a bowl of milk outside the door for the Little People.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>The Ambassador from Alpheratz <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, the South African Nationalist planet, with a full beard, and old fashioned plug hat and tailcoat. They were a frustrated lot. They had gone into space to practice apartheid and had settled on a planet where there was no other intelligent race to be superior to.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>The Mormon Ambassador from Deseret⁠—Delta Camelopardalis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>The Ambassador from Spica <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, a short jolly-looking little fellow, with a head like a seal’s, long arms, short legs and a tail like a kangaroo’s.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>The Ambassador from Beta Cephus <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, who could have passed for human if he hadn’t had blood with a copper base instead of iron. His skin was a dark green and his hair was a bright blue.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>I was beginning to correct my first impression that Thrombley was a complete dithering fool. He stood at my left elbow, whispering the names and governments and home planets of the Ambassadors as they came up, handing me little slips of paper on which he had written phonetically correct renditions of the greetings I would give them in their own language. I was still twittering a reply to the greeting of Nanadabadian, from Beta Cephus <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, when he whispered to me:</p>
				<p>“Here it comes, sir. The z’Srauff!”</p>
				<p>The z’Srauff were reasonably close to human stature and appearance, allowing for the fact that their ancestry had been canine instead of simian. They had, of course, longer and narrower jaws than we have, and definitely carnivorous teeth.</p>
				<p>There were stories floating around that they enjoyed barbecued Terran even better than they did supercow and hot relish.</p>
				<p>This one advanced, extending his three-fingered hand.</p>
				<p>“I am most happy to make connection with Solar League representative,” he said. “I am named Gglafrr Ddespttann Vuvuvu.”</p>
				<p>No wonder Thrombley let him introduce himself. I answered in the Basic English that was all he’d admit to understanding:</p>
				<p>“The name of your great nation has gone before you to me. The stories we tell to our young of you are at the top of our books. I have hope to make great pleasure in you and me to be friends.”</p>
				<p>Gglafrr Vuvuvu’s smile wavered a little at the oblique reference to the couple of trouncings our Space Navy had administered to z’Srauff ships in the past. “We will be in the same place again times with no number,” the alien replied. “I have hope for you that time you are in this place will be long and will put pleasure in your heart.”</p>
				<p>Then the pressure of the line behind him pushed him on. Cabinet Members; Senators and Representatives; prominent citizens, mostly Judge so-and-so, or Colonel this-or-that. It was all a blur, so much so that it was an instant before I recognized the gleaming golden hair and the statuesque figure.</p>
				<p>“Thank you! I have met the Ambassador.” The lovely voice was shaking with restrained anger.</p>
				<p>“Gail!” I exclaimed.</p>
				<p>“Your father coming to the barbecue, Gail?” President Hutchinson was asking.</p>
				<p>“He ought to be here any minute. He sent me on ahead from the hotel. He wants to meet the Ambassador. That’s why I joined the line.”</p>
				<p>“Well, suppose I leave <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk in your hands for a while,” Hutchinson said. “I ought to circulate around a little.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Just leave him in my hands!” she said vindictively.</p>
				<p>“What’s wrong, Gail?” I wanted to know. “I know, I was supposed to meet you at the spaceport, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You made a beautiful fool of me at the spaceport!”</p>
				<p>“Look, I can explain everything. My Embassy staff insisted on hurrying me off⁠—”</p>
				<p>Somebody gave a high-pitched whoop directly behind me and emptied the clip of a pistol. I couldn’t even hear what else I said. I couldn’t hear what she said, either, but it was something angry.</p>
				<p>“You have to listen to me!” I roared in her ear. “I can explain everything!”</p>
				<p>“Any diplomat can explain anything!” she shouted back.</p>
				<p>“Look, Gail, you’re hanging an innocent man!” I yelled back at her. “I’m entitled to a fair trial!”</p>
				<p>Somebody on the platform began firing his pistol within inches of the loudspeakers and it sounded like an H-bomb going off. She grabbed my wrist and dragged me toward a door under the platform.</p>
				<p>“Down here!” she yelled. “And this better be good, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk!”</p>
				<p>We went down a spiral ramp, lighted by widely-scattered overhead lights.</p>
				<p>“Space-attack shelter,” she explained. “And look: what goes on in spaceships is one thing, but it’s as much as a girl’s reputation is worth to come down here during a barbecue.”</p>
				<p>There seemed to be quite few girls at that barbecue who didn’t care what happened to their reputations. We discovered that after looking into a couple of passageways that branched off the entrance.</p>
				<p>“Over this way,” Gail said, “Confederate Courts Building. There won’t be anything going on over here, now.”</p>
				<p>I told her, with as much humorous detail as possible, about how Thrombley had shanghaied me to the Embassy, and about the chase by the Rangers. Before I was half through, she was laughing heartily, all traces of her anger gone. Finally, we came to a stairway, and at the head of it to a small door.</p>
				<p>“It’s been four years that I’ve been away from here,” she said. “I think there’s a reading room of the Law Library up here. Let’s go in and enjoy the quiet for a while.”</p>
				<p>But when we opened the door, there was a Ranger standing inside.</p>
				<p>“Come to see a trial, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk? Oh, hello, Gail. Just in time; they’re going to prepare for the next trial.”</p>
				<p>As he spoke, something clicked at the door. Gail looked at me in consternation.</p>
				<p>“Now we’re locked in,” she said. “We can’t get out till the trial’s over.”</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">V</h3>
				<p>I looked around.</p>
				<p>We were on a high balcony, at the end of a long, narrow room. In front of us, windows rose to the ceiling, and it was evident that the floor of the room was about twenty feet below ground level. Outside, I could see the barbecue still going on, but not a murmur of noise penetrated to us. What seemed to be the judge’s bench was against the outside wall, under the tall windows. To the right of it was a railed stand with a chair in it, and in front, arranged in U-shape, were three tables at which a number of men were hastily conferring. There were nine judges in a row on the bench, all in black gowns. The spectators’ seats below were filled with people, and there were quite a few up here on the balcony.</p>
				<p>“What is this? Supreme Court?” I asked as Gail piloted me to a couple of seats where we could be alone.</p>
				<p>“No, Court of Political Justice,” she told me. “This is the court that’s going to try those three Bonney brothers, who killed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw.”</p>
				<p>It suddenly occurred to me that this was the first time I had heard anything specific about the death of my predecessor.</p>
				<p>“That isn’t the trial that’s going on now, I hope?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no; that won’t be for a couple of days. Not till after you can arrange to attend. I don’t know what this trial is. I only got home today, myself.”</p>
				<p>“What’s the procedure here?” I wanted to know.</p>
				<p>“Well, those nine men are judges,” she began. “The one in the middle is President Judge Nelson. You’ve met his son⁠—the Ranger officer who chased you from the spaceport. He’s a regular jurist. The other eight are prominent citizens who are drawn from a panel, like a jury. The men at the table on the left are the prosecution: friends of the politician who was killed. And the ones on the right are the defense: they’ll try to prove that the dead man got what was coming to him. The ones in the middle are friends of the court: they’re just anybody who has any interest in the case⁠—people who want to get some point of law cleared up, or see some precedent established, or something like that.”</p>
				<p>“You seem to assume that this is a homicide case,” I mentioned.</p>
				<p>“They generally are. Sometimes mayhem, or wounding, or simple assault, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>There had been some sort of conference going on in the open space of floor between the judges’ bench and the three tables. It broke up, now, and the judge in the middle rapped with his gavel.</p>
				<p>“Are you gentlemen ready?” he asked. “All right, then. Court of Political Justice of the Confederate Continents of New Texas is now in session. Case of the friends of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Austin Maverick, deceased, late of James Bowie Continent, versus Wilbur Whately.”</p>
				<p>“My God, did somebody finally kill Aus Maverick?” Gail whispered.</p>
				<p>On the center table, in front of the friends of the court, both sides seemed to have piled their exhibits; among the litter I saw some torn clothing, a big white sombrero covered with blood, and a long machete.</p>
				<p>“The general nature of the case,” the judge was saying, “is that the defendant, Wilbur Whately, of Sam Houston Continent, is here charged with divers offenses arising from the death of the Honorable <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Austin Maverick, whom he killed on the front steps of the Legislative Assembly Building, here in New Austin.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p><q>What goes on here?</q> I thought angrily. <q>This is the rankest instance of a prejudged case I’ve ever seen.</q> I started to say as much to Gail, but she hushed me.</p>
				<p>“I want to hear the specifications,” she said.</p>
				<p>A man at the prosecution table had risen.</p>
				<p>“Please the court,” he began, “the defendant, Wilbur Whately, is here charged with political irresponsibility and excessive atrocity in exercising his constitutional right of criticism of a practicing politician.</p>
				<p>“The specifications are, as follows: That, on the afternoon of May Seventh, Anno Domini 2193, the defendant here present did arm himself with a machete, said machete not being one of his normal and accustomed weapons, and did loiter in wait on the front steps of the Legislative Assembly Building in the city of New Austin, Continent of Sam Houston, and did approach the decedent, addressing him in abusive, obscene, and indecent language, and did set upon and attack him with the machete aforesaid, causing the said decedent, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Austin Maverick, to die.”</p>
				<p>The court wanted to know how the defendant would plead. Somebody, without bothering to rise, said, “Not guilty, Your Honor,” from the defense table.</p>
				<p>There was a brief scraping of chairs; four of five men from the defense and the prosecution tables got up and advanced to confer in front of the bench, comparing sheets of paper. The man who had read the charges, obviously the chief prosecutor, made himself the spokesman.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor, defense and prosecution wish to enter the following stipulations: That the decedent was a practicing politician within the meaning of the Constitution, that he met his death in the manner stated in the coroner’s report, and that he was killed by the defendant, Wilbur Whately.”</p>
				<p>“Is that agreeable to you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vincent?” the judge wanted to know.</p>
				<p>The defense answered affirmatively. I sat back, gaping like a fool. Why, that was practically⁠—no, it <em>was</em>⁠—a confession.</p>
				<p>“All right, gentlemen,” the judge said. “Now we have all that out of the way, let’s get on with the case.”</p>
				<p>As though there were any case to get on with! I fully expected them to take it on from there in song, words by Gilbert and music by Sullivan.</p>
				<p>“Well, Your Honor, we have a number of character witnesses,” the prosecution⁠—prosecution, for God’s sake!⁠—announced.</p>
				<p>“Skip them,” the defense said. “We stipulate.”</p>
				<p>“But you can’t stipulate character testimony,” the prosecution argued. “You don’t know what our witnesses are going to testify to.”</p>
				<p>“Sure we do: they’re going to give us a big long shaggy-dog story about the Life and Miracles of Saint Austin Maverick. We’ll agree in advance to all that; this case is concerned only with his record as a politician. And as he spent the last fifteen years in the Senate, that’s all a matter of public record. I assume that the prosecution is going to introduce all that, too?”</p>
				<p>“Well, naturally.⁠ ⁠…” the prosecutor began.</p>
				<p>“Including his public acts on the last day of his life?” the counsel for the defense demanded. “His actions on the morning of May seventh as chairman of the Finance and Revenue Committee? You going to introduce that as evidence for the prosecution?”</p>
				<p>“Well, no.⁠ ⁠…” the prosecutor began.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor, we ask to have a certified copy of the proceedings of the Senate Finance and Revenue Committee for the morning of May Seventh, 2193, read into the record of this court,” the counsel for the defense said. “And thereafter, we rest our case.”</p>
				<p>“Has the prosecution anything to say before we close the court?” Judge Nelson inquired.</p>
				<p>“Well, Your Honor, this seems⁠ ⁠… that is, we ought to hear both sides of it. My old friend, Aus Maverick, was really a fine man; he did a lot of good for the people of his continent.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“Yeah, we’d of lynched him, when he got back, if somebody hadn’t chopped him up here in New Austin!” a voice from the rear of the courtroom broke in.</p>
				<p>The prosecution hemmed and hawed for a moment, and then announced, in a hasty mumble, that it rested.</p>
				<p>“I will now close the court,” Judge Nelson said. “I advise everybody to keep your seats. I don’t think it’s going to be closed very long.”</p>
				<p>And then, he actually closed the court; pressing a button on the bench, he raised a high black screen in front of him and his colleagues. It stayed up for some sixty seconds, and then dropped again.</p>
				<p>“The Court of Political Justice has reached a verdict,” he announced. “Wilbur Whately, and your attorney, approach and hear the verdict.”</p>
				<p>The defense lawyer motioned a young man who had been sitting beside him to rise. In the silence that had fallen, I could hear the defendant’s boots squeaking as he went forward to hear his fate. The judge picked up a belt and a pair of pistols that had been lying in front of him.</p>
				<p>“Wilbur Whately,” he began, “this court is proud to announce that you have been unanimously acquitted of the charge of political irresponsibility, and of unjustified and excessive atrocity.</p>
				<p>“There was one dissenting vote on acquitting you of the charge of political irresponsibility; one of the associate judges felt that the late unmitigated scoundrel, Austin Maverick, ought to have been skinned alive, an inch at a time. You are, however, acquitted of that charge, too.</p>
				<p>“You all know,” he continued, addressing the entire assemblage, “the reason for which this young hero cut down that monster of political iniquity, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Austin Maverick. On the very morning of his justly-merited death, Austin Maverick, using the powers of his political influence, rammed through the Finance and Revenue Committee a bill entitled ‘An Act for the Taxing of Personal Incomes, and for the Levying of a Withholding Tax.’ Fellow citizens, words fail me to express my horror of this diabolic proposition, this proposed instrument of tyrannical extortion, borrowed from the Dark Ages of the Twentieth Century! Why, if this young nobleman had not taken his blade in hand, I’d have killed the sonofabitch, myself!”</p>
				<p>He leaned forward, extending the belt and holsters to the defendant.</p>
				<p>“I therefore restore to you your weapons, taken from you when, in compliance with the law, you were formally arrested. Buckle them on, and, assuming your weapons again, go forth from this court a free man, Wilbur Whately. And take with you that machete with which you vindicated the liberties and rights of all New Texans. Bear it reverently to your home, hang it among your lares and penates, cherish it, and dying, mention it within your will, bequeathing it as a rich legacy unto your issue! Court adjourned; next session 0900 tomorrow. For Chrissake, let’s get out of here before the barbecue’s over!”</p>
				<p>Some of the spectators, drooling for barbecued supercow, began crowding and jostling toward the exits; more of them were pushing to the front of the courtroom, cheering and waving their hip-flasks. The prosecution and about half of the friends of the court hastily left by a side door, probably to issue statements disassociating themselves from the deceased Maverick.</p>
				<p>“So that’s the court that’s going to try the men who killed Ambassador Cumshaw,” I commented, as Gail and I went out. “Why, the purpose of that court seems to be to acquit murderers.”</p>
				<p>“Murderers?” She was indignant. “That wasn’t murder. He just killed a politician. All the court could do was determine whether or not the politician needed it, and while I never heard about Maverick’s income-tax proposition, I can’t see how they could have brought in any other kind of a verdict. Of all the outrageous things!”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>I was thoughtfully silent as we went out into the plaza, which was still a riot of noise and polychromatic costumes. And my thoughts were as weltered as the scene before me.</p>
				<p>Apparently, on New Texas, killing a politician wasn’t regarded as <i xml:lang="la">mallum in se</i>, and was <i xml:lang="la">mallum prohibitorum</i> only to the extent that what happened to the politician was in excess of what he deserved. I began to understand why Palme was such a scared rabbit, why Hutchinson had that hunted look and kept his hands always within inches of his pistols.</p>
				<p>I began to feel more pity than contempt for Thrombley, too. <q>He’s been on this planet too long and he should never have been sent here in the first place. I’ll rotate him home as soon as possible.⁠ ⁠…</q></p>
				<p>Then the full meaning of what I had seen finally got through to me: if they were going to try the killers of Cumshaw in that court, that meant that on New Texas, foreign diplomats were regarded as practicing politicians.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>That made me a practicing politician too!</p>
				<p>And that’s why, when we got back to the vicinity of the bandstand, I had my right hand close to my pistol, with my thumb on the inconspicuous little spot of silver inlay that operated the secret holster mechanism.</p>
				<p>I saw Hutchinson and Palme and Thrombley ahead. With them was a newcomer, a portly, ruddy-faced gentleman with a white mustache and goatee, dressed in a white suit. Gail broke away from me and ran toward him. This, I thought, would be her father; now I would be introduced and find out just what her last name was. I followed, more slowly, and saw a waiter, with a wheeled serving-table, move in behind the group which she had joined.</p>
				<p>So I saw what none of them did⁠—the waiter suddenly reversed his long carving-knife and poised himself for a blow at President Hutchinson’s back. I simply pressed the little silver stud on my belt, the Krupp-Tatta popped obediently out of the holster into my open hand. I thumbed off the safety and swung up; when my sights closed on the rising hand that held the knife, I fired.</p>
				<p>Hoddy Ringo, who had been holding a sandwich with one hand and a drink with the other, dropped both and jumped on the man whose hand I had smashed. A couple of Rangers closed in and grabbed him, also. The group around President Hutchinson had all turned and were staring from me to the man I had shot, and from him to the knife with the broken handle, lying on the ground.</p>
				<p>Hutchinson spoke first. “Well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador! My Government thanks your Government! That was nice shooting!”</p>
				<p>“Hey, you been holdin’ out on me!” Hoddy accused. “I never knew you was that kinda gunfighter!”</p>
				<p>“There’s a new wrinkle,” the man with the white goatee said. “We’ll have to screen the help at these affairs a little more closely.” He turned to me. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, New Texas owes you a great deal for saving the President’s life. If you’ll get that pistol out of your hand, I’d be proud to shake it, sir.”</p>
				<p>I holstered my automatic, and took his hand. Gail was saying, “Stephen, this is my father,” and at the same time, Palme, the Secretary of State, was doing it more formally:</p>
				<p>“Ambassador Silk, may I present one of our leading citizens and large ranchers, Colonel Andrew Jackson Hickock.”</p>
				<p>Dumbarton Oaks had taught me how to maintain the proper diplomat’s unchanging expression; drinking superbourbon had been a postgraduate course. I needed that training as I finally learned Gail’s last name.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">VI</h3>
				<p>It was early evening before we finally managed to get away from the barbecue. Thrombley had called the Embassy and told them not to wait dinner for us, so the staff had finished eating and were relaxing in the patio when our car came in through the street gate. Stonehenge and another man came over to meet us as we got out⁠—a man I hadn’t met before.</p>
				<p>He was a little fellow, half-Latin, half-Oriental; in New Texas costume and wearing a pair of pistols like mine, in State Department Special Services holsters. He didn’t look like a Dumbarton Oaks product: I thought he was more likely an alumnus of some private detective agency.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Francisco Parros, our Intelligence man,” Stonehenge introduced him.</p>
				<p>“Sorry I wasn’t here when you arrived, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Parros said. “Out checking on some things. But I saw that bit of shooting, on the telecast screen in a bar over town. You know, there was a camera right over the bandstand that caught the whole thing⁠—you and Miss Hickock coming toward the President and his party, Miss Hickock running forward to her father, the waiter going up behind Hutchinson with the knife, and then that beautiful draw and snap shot. They ran it again a couple of times on the half-hourly newscast. Everybody in New Austin, maybe on New Texas, is talking about it, now.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, indeed, sir,” Gomez, the Embassy Secretary, said, joining us. “You’ve made yourself more popular in the eight hours since you landed than poor <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw had been able to do in the ten years he spent here. But, I’m afraid, sir, you’ve given me a good deal of work, answering your fan-mail.”</p>
				<p>We went over and sat down at one of the big tables under the arches at the side of the patio.</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s all to the good,” I said. “I’m going to need a lot of local good will, in the next few weeks. No thanks, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Parros,” I added, as the Intelligence man picked up a bottle and made to pour for me. “I’ve been practically swimming in superbourbon all afternoon. A little black coffee, if you don’t mind. And now, gentlemen, if you’ll all be seated, we’ll see what has to be done.”</p>
				<p>“A council of war, in effect, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador?” Stonehenge inquired.</p>
				<p>“Let’s call it a council to estimate the situation. But I’ll have to find out from you first exactly what the situation here is.”</p>
				<p>Thrombley stirred uneasily. “But sir, I confess that I don’t understand. Your briefing on Luna.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“Was practically nonexistent. I had a total of six hours to get aboard ship, from the moment I was notified that I had been appointed to this Embassy.”</p>
				<p>“Incredible!” Thrombley murmured.</p>
				<p>I wondered what he’d say if I told him that I thought it was deliberate.</p>
				<p>“Naturally, I spent some time on the ship reading up on this planet, but I know practically nothing about what’s been going on here in, say, the last year. And all I know about the death of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw is that he is said to have been killed by three brothers named Bonney.”</p>
				<p>“So you’ll want just about everything, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Thrombley said. “Really, I don’t know where to begin.”</p>
				<p>“Start with why and how <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw was killed. The rest, I believe, will key into that.”</p>
				<p>So they began; Thrombley, Stonehenge and Parros doing the talking. It came to this:</p>
				<p>Ever since we had first established an Embassy on New Texas, the goal of our diplomacy on this planet had been to secure it into the Solar League. And it was a goal which seemed very little closer to realization now than it had been twenty-three years before.</p>
				<p>“You must know, by now, what politics on this planet are like, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Thrombley said.</p>
				<p>“I have an idea. One Ambassador gone native, another gone crazy, the third killed himself, the fourth murdered.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, indeed. I’ve been here fifteen years, myself.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“That’s entirely too long for anybody to be stationed in this place,” I told him. “If I’m not murdered, myself, in the next couple of weeks, I’m going to see that you and any other member of this staff who’s been here over ten years are rotated home for a tour of duty at Department Headquarters.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, would you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk? I would be so happy.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>Thrombley wasn’t much in the way of an ally, but at least he had a sound, selfish motive for helping me stay alive. I assured him I would get him sent back to Luna, and then went on with the discussion.</p>
				<p>Up until six months ago, Silas Cumshaw had modeled himself after the typical New Texas politician. He had always worn at least two faces, and had always managed to place himself on every side of every issue at once. Nothing he ever said could possibly be construed as controversial. Naturally, the cause of New Texan annexation to the Solar League had made no progress whatever.</p>
				<p>Then, one evening, at a banquet, he had executed a complete 180-degree turn, delivering a speech in which he proclaimed that union with the Solar League was the only possible way in which New Texans could retain even a vestige of local sovereignty. He had talked about an invasion as though the enemy’s ships were already coming out of hyperspace, and had named the invader, calling the z’Srauff “our common enemy.” The z’Srauff Ambassador, also present, had immediately gotten up and stalked out, amid a derisive chorus of barking and baying from the New Texans. The New Texans were first shocked and then wildly delighted; they had been so used to hearing nothing but inanities and high-order abstractions from their public figures that the Solar League Ambassador had become a hero overnight.</p>
				<p>“Sounds as though there is a really strong sentiment at what used to be called the grassroots level in favor of annexation,” I commented.</p>
				<p>“There is,” Parros told me. “Of course, there is a very strong isolationist, anti-annexation, sentiment, too. The sentiment in favor of annexation is based on the point <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw made⁠—the danger of conquest by the z’Srauff. Against that, of course, there is fear of higher taxes, fear of loss of local sovereignty, fear of abrogation of local customs and institutions, and chauvinistic pride.”</p>
				<p>“We can deal with some of that by furnishing guarantees of local self-government; the emotional objections can be met by convincing them that we need the great planet of New Texas to add glory and luster to the Solar League,” I said. “You think, then, that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw was assassinated by opponents of annexation?”</p>
				<p>“Of course, sir,” Thrombley replied. “These Bonneys were only hirelings. Here’s what happened, on the day of the murder:</p>
				<p>“It was the day after a holiday, a big one here on New Texas, celebrating some military victory by the Texans on Terra, a battle called San Jacinto. We didn’t have any business to handle, because all the local officials were home nursing hangovers, so when Colonel Hickock called⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Who?” I asked sharply.</p>
				<p>“Colonel Hickock. The father of the young lady you were so attentive to at the barbecue. He and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw had become great friends, beginning shortly before the speech the Ambassador made at that banquet. He called about 0900, inviting <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw out to his ranch for the day, and as there was nothing in the way of official business, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw said he’d be out by 1030.</p>
				<p>“When he got there, there was an aircar circling about, near the ranchhouse. As <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw got out of his car and started up the front steps, somebody in this car landed it on the driveway and began shooting with a twenty-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-rifle. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw was hit several times, and killed instantly.”</p>
				<p>“The fellows who did the shooting were damned lucky,” Stonehenge took over. “Hickock’s a big rancher. I don’t know how much you know about supercow-ranching, sir, but those things have to be herded with tanks and light aircraft, so that every rancher has at his disposal a fairly good small air-armor combat team. Naturally, all the big ranchers are colonels in the Armed Reserve. Hickock has about fifteen fast fighters, and thirty medium tanks armed with fifty-<abbr>mm</abbr> guns. He also has some <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">A.A.</abbr>-guns around his ranch house⁠—every once in a while, these ranchers get to squabbling among themselves.</p>
				<p>“Well, these three Bonney brothers were just turning away when a burst from the ranch house caught their jet assembly, and they could only get as far as Bonneyville, thirty miles away, before they had to land. They landed right in front of the town jail.</p>
				<p>“This Bonneyville’s an awful shantytown; everybody in it is related to everybody else. The mayor, for instance, Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney, is an uncle of theirs.</p>
				<p>“These three boys⁠—Switchblade Joe Bonney, Jack-High Abe Bonney and Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney⁠—immediately claimed sanctuary in the jail, on the grounds that they had been near to⁠—get that; I think that indicates the line they’re going to take at the trial⁠—<em>near</em> to a political assassination. They were immediately given the protection of the jail, which is about the only well-constructed building in the place, practically a fort.”</p>
				<p>“You think that was planned in advance?” I asked.</p>
				<p>Parros nodded emphatically. “I do. There was a hell of a big gang of these Bonneys at the jail, almost the entire able-bodied population of the place. As soon as Switchblade and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzard landed, they were rushed inside and all the doors barred. About three minutes later, the Hickock outfit started coming in, first aircraft and then armor. They gave that town a regular Georgie Patton style blitzing.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. I’m only sorry I wasn’t there to see it,” Stonehenge put in. “They knocked down or burned most of the shanties, and then they went to work on the jail. The aircraft began dumping these firebombs and stun-bombs that they use to stop supercow stampedes, and the tank-guns began to punch holes in the walls. As soon as Kettle-Belly saw what he had on his hands, he radioed a call for Ranger protection. Our friend Captain Nelson went out to see what the trouble was.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. I got the story of that from Nelson,” Parros put in. “Much as he hated to do it, he had to protect the Bonneys. And as soon as he’d taken a hand, Hickock had to call off his gang. But he was smart. He grabbed everything relating to the killing⁠—the aircar and the twenty-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-rifle in particular⁠—and he’s keeping them under cover. Very few people know about that, or about the fact that on physical evidence alone, he has the killing pinned on the Bonneys so well that they’ll never get away with this story of being merely innocent witnesses.”</p>
				<p>“The rest, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk, is up to us,” Thrombley said. “I have Colonel Hickock’s assurance that he will give us every assistance, but we simply must see to it that those creatures with the outlandish names are convicted.”</p>
				<p>I didn’t have a chance to say anything to that: at that moment, one of the servants ushered Captain Nelson toward us.</p>
				<p>“Good evening, Captain,” I greeted the Ranger. “Join us, seeing that you’re on foreign soil and consequently not on duty.”</p>
				<p>He sat down with us and poured a drink.</p>
				<p>“I thought you might be interested,” he said. “We gave that waiter a going-over. We wanted to know who put him up to it. He tried to sell us the line that he was a New Texan patriot, trying to kill a tyrant, but we finally got the truth out of him. He was paid a thousand pesos to do the job, by a character they call Snake-Eyes Sam Bonney. A cousin of the three who killed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw.”</p>
				<p>“Nephew of Kettle-Belly Sam,” Parros interjected. “You pick him up?”</p>
				<p>Nelson shook his head disgustedly. “He’s out in the high grass somewhere. We’re still looking for him. Oh, yes, and I just heard that the trial of Switchblade, and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzard is scheduled for three days from now. You’ll be notified in due form tomorrow, but I thought you might like to know in advance.”</p>
				<p>“I certainly do, and thank you, Captain.⁠ ⁠… We were just talking about you when you arrived,” I mentioned. “About the arrest, or rescue, or whatever you call it, of that trio.”</p>
				<p>“Yeah. One of the jobs I’m not particularly proud of. Pity Hickock’s boys didn’t get hold of them before I got there. It’d of saved everybody a lot of trouble.”</p>
				<p>“Just what impression did you get at the time, Captain?” I asked. “You think Kettle-Belly knew in advance what they were going to do?”</p>
				<p>“Sure he did. They had the whole jail fortified. Not like a jail usually is, to keep people from getting out; but like a fort, to keep people from getting in. There were no prisoners inside. I found out that they had all been released that morning.”</p>
				<p>He stopped, seemed to be weighing his words, then continued, speaking very slowly.</p>
				<p>“Let me tell you first some things I can’t testify to, couple of things that I figure went wrong with their plans.</p>
				<p>“One of Colonel Hickock’s men was on the porch to greet <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw and he recognized the Bonneys. That was lucky; otherwise we might still be lookin’ and wonderin’ who did the shootin,’ which might not have been good for New Texas.”</p>
				<p>He cocked an eyebrow and I nodded. The Solar League, in similar cases, had regarded such planetary governments as due for change without notice and had promptly made the change.</p>
				<p>“Number two,” Captain Nelson continued, “that <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">A.A.</abbr>-shot which hit their aircar. I don’t think they intended to land at the jail⁠—it was just sort of a reserve hiding-hole. But because they’d been hit, they had to land. And they’d been slowed down so much that they couldn’t dispose of the evidence before the Colonel’s boys were tappin’ on the door ’n’ askin,’ couldn’t they come in.”</p>
				<p>“I gather the Colonel’s task-force was becoming insistent,” I prompted him.</p>
				<p>The big Ranger grinned. “Now we’re on things I can testify to.</p>
				<p>“When I got there, what had been the cellblock was on fire, and they were trying to defend the mayor’s office and the warden’s office. These Bonneys gave me the line that they’d been witnesses to the killing of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw by Colonel Hickock and that the Hickock outfit was trying to rub them out to keep them from testifying. I just laughed and started to walk out. Finally, they confessed that they’d shot <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw, but they claimed it was right of action against political malfeasance. When they did that, I had to take them in.”</p>
				<p>“They confessed to you, before you arrested them?” I wanted to be sure of that point.</p>
				<p>“That’s right. I’m going to testify to that, Monday, when the trial is held. And that ain’t all: we got their fingerprints off the car, off the gun, off some shells still in the clip, and we have the gun identified to the shells that killed <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw. We got their confession fully corroborated.”</p>
				<p>I asked him if he’d give <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Parros a complete statement of what he’d seen and heard at Bonneyville. He was more than willing and I suggested that they go into Parros’ office, where they’d be undisturbed. The Ranger and my Intelligence man got up and took a bottle of superbourbon with them. As they were leaving, Nelson turned to Hoddy, who was still with us.</p>
				<p>“You’ll have to look to your laurels, Hoddy,” Nelson said. “Your Ambassador seems to be making quite a reputation for himself as a gunfighter.”</p>
				<p>“Look,” Hoddy said, and though he was facing Nelson, I felt he was really talking to Stonehenge, “before I’d go up against this guy, I’d shoot myself. That way, I could be sure I’d get a nice painless job.”</p>
				<p>After they were gone, I turned to Stonehenge and Thrombley. “This seems to be a carefully prearranged killing.”</p>
				<p>They agreed.</p>
				<p>“Then they knew <em>in advance</em> that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw would be on Colonel Hickock’s front steps at about 1030. <em>How did they find that out?</em>”</p>
				<p>“Why⁠ ⁠… why, I’m sure I don’t know,” Thrombley said. It was most obvious that the idea had never occurred to him before and a side glance told me that the thought was new to Stonehenge also. “Colonel Hickock called at 0900. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw left the Embassy in an aircar a few minutes later. It took an hour and a half to fly out to the Hickock ranch.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“I don’t like the implications, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Stonehenge said. “I can’t believe that was how it happened. In the first place, Colonel Hickock isn’t that sort of man: he doesn’t use his hospitality to trap people to their death. In the second place, he wouldn’t have needed to use people like these Bonneys. His own men would do anything for him. In the third place, he is one of the leaders of the annexation movement here and this was obviously an anti-annexation job. And in the fourth place⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Hold it!” I checked him. “Are you sure he’s really on the annexation side?”</p>
				<p>He opened his mouth to answer me quickly, then closed it, waited a moment, answered me slowly. “I can guess what you are thinking, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk. But, remember, when Colonel Hickock came here as our first Ambassador, he came here as a man with a mission. He had studied the problem and he believed in what he came for. He has never changed.</p>
				<p>“Let me emphasize this, sir: we know he has never changed. For our own protection, we’ve had to check on every real leader of the annexation movement, screening them for crackpots who might do us more harm than good. The Colonel is with us all the way.</p>
				<p>“And now, in the fourth place, underlined by what I’ve just said, the Colonel and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw were really friends.”</p>
				<p>“Now you’re talking!” Hoddy burst in. “I’ve knowed <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A. J.</abbr> ever since I was a kid. Ever since he married old Colonel MacTodd’s daughter. That just ain’t the way <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A. J.</abbr> works!”</p>
				<p>“On the other hand, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” Thrombley said, keeping his gaze fixed on Hoddy’s hands and apparently ready to both duck and shut up if Hoddy moved a finger, “you will recall, I think, that Colonel Hickock did do everything in his power to see that these Bonney brothers did not reach court alive. And, let me add,” he was getting bolder, tilting his chin up a little, “it’s a choice as simple as this: either Colonel Hickock told them, or we have⁠—and this is unbelievable⁠—a traitor in the Embassy itself.”</p>
				<p>That statement rocked even Hoddy. Even though he was probably no more than one of Natalenko’s little men, he still couldn’t help knowing how thoroughly we were screened, indoctrinated, and⁠—let’s face it⁠—mind-conditioned. A traitor among us was unthinkable because we just couldn’t think that way.</p>
				<p>The silence, the sorrow, were palpable. Then I remembered, told them, Hickock himself had been a Department man.</p>
				<p>Stonehenge gripped his head between his hands and squeezed as if trying to bring out an idea. “All right, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, where are we now? Nobody who knew could have told the Bonney boys where <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw would be at 1030, yet the three men were there waiting for him. You take it from there. I’m just a simple military man and I’m ready to go back to the simple military life as soon as possible.”</p>
				<p>I turned to Gomez. “There could be an obvious explanation. Bring us the official telescreen log. Let’s see what calls were made. Maybe <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw himself said something to someone that gave his destination away.”</p>
				<p>“That won’t be necessary,” Thrombley told me. “None of the junior clerks were on duty, and I took the only three calls that came in, myself. First, there was the call from Colonel Hickock. Then, the call about the wrist watch. And then, a couple of hours later, the call from the Hickock ranch, about <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw’s death.”</p>
				<p>“What was the call about the wrist watch?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Oh, that was from the z’Srauff Embassy,” Thrombley said. “For some time, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw had been trying to get one of the very precise watches which the z’Srauff manufacture on their home planet. The z’Srauff Ambassador called, that day, to tell him that they had one for him and wanted to know when it was to be delivered. I told them the Ambassador was out, and they wanted to know where they could call him and I⁠—”</p>
				<p>I had never seen a man look more horror-stricken.</p>
				<p>“Oh, my God! I’m the one who told them!”</p>
				<p>What could I say? Not much, but I tried. “How could you know, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley? You did the natural, the normal, the proper thing, on a call from one Ambassador to another.”</p>
				<p>I turned to the others, who, like me, preferred not to look at Thrombley. “They must have had a spy outside who told them the Ambassador had left the Embassy. Alone, right? And that was just what they’d been waiting for.</p>
				<p>“But what’s this about the watch, though. There’s more to this than a simple favor from one Ambassador to another.”</p>
				<p>“My turn, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” Stonehenge interrupted. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw had been trying to get one of the things at my insistence. Naval Intelligence is very much interested in them and we want a sample. The z’Srauff watches are very peculiar⁠—they’re operated by radium decay, which, of course is a universal constant. They’re uniform to a tenth second and they’re all synchronized with the official time at the capital city of the principal z’Srauff planet. The time used by the z’Srauff Navy.”</p>
				<p>Stonehenge deliberately paused, let that last phrase hang heavily in the air for a moment, then he continued.</p>
				<p>“They’re supposed to be used in religious observances⁠—timing hours of prayer, I believe. They can, of course, have other uses.</p>
				<p>“For example, I can imagine all those watches giving the wearer a light electric shock, or ringing a little bell, all over New Texas, at exactly the same moment. And then I can imagine all the z’Srauff running down into nice deep holes in the ground.”</p>
				<p>He looked at his own watch. “And that reminds me: my gang of pirates are at the spaceport by now, ready to blast off. I wonder if someone could drive me there.”</p>
				<p>“I’ll drive him, boss,” Hoddy volunteered. “I ain’t doin’ nothin’ else.”</p>
				<p>I was wondering how I could break that up, plausibly and without betraying my suspicions, when Parros and Captain Nelson came out and joined us.</p>
				<p>“I have a lot of stuff here,” Parros said. “Stuff we never seemed to have noticed. For instance⁠—”</p>
				<p>I interrupted. “Commander Stonehenge’s going to the spaceport, now,” I said. “Suppose you ride with him, and brief him on what you learned, on the way. Then, when he’s aboard, come back and tell us.”</p>
				<p>Hoddy looked at me for a long ten seconds. His expression started by being exasperated and ended by betraying grudging admiration.</p>

			<section id="lone-star-planet-7" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">VII</h3>
				<p>The next morning, which was Saturday, I put Thrombley in charge of the routine work of the Embassy, but first instructed him to answer all inquiries about me with the statement, literally true, that I was too immersed in work of clearing up matters left unfinished after the death of the former Ambassador for any social activities. Then I called the Hickock ranch in the west end of Sam Houston Continent, mentioning an invitation the Colonel and his daughter had extended me, and told them I would be out to see them before noon that same day. With Hoddy Ringo driving the car, I arrived about 1000, and was welcomed by Gail and her father, who had flown out the evening before, after the barbecue.</p>
				<p>Hoddy, accompanied by a Ranger and one of Hickock’s ranch hands, all three disguised in shabby and grease-stained cast-offs borrowed at the ranch, and driving a dilapidated aircar from the ranch junkyard, were sent to visit the slum village of Bonneyville. They spent all day there, posing as a trio of range tramps out of favor with the law.</p>
				<p>I spent the day with Gail, flying over the range, visiting Hickock’s herd camps and slaughtering crews. It was a pleasant day and I managed to make it constructive as well.</p>
				<p>Because of their huge size⁠—they ran to a live weight of around fifteen tons⁠—and their uncertain disposition, supercows are not really domesticated. Each rancher owned the herds on his own land, chiefly by virtue of constant watchfulness over them. There were always a couple of helicopters hovering over each herd, with fast fighter planes waiting on call to come in and drop firebombs or stun-bombs in front of them if they showed a disposition to wander too far. Naturally, things of this size could not be shipped live to the market; they were butchered on the range, and the meat hauled out in big ’copter-trucks.</p>
				<p>Slaughtering was dangerous and exciting work. It was done with medium tanks mounting fifty-<abbr>mm</abbr> guns, usually working at the rear of the herd, although a supercow herd could change directions almost in a second and the killing-tanks would then find themselves in front of a stampede. I saw several such incidents. Once Gail and I had to dive in with our car and help turn such a stampede.</p>
				<p>We got back to the ranch house shortly before dinner. Gail went at once to change clothes; Colonel Hickock and I sat down together for a drink in his library, a beautiful room. I especially admired the walls, panelled in plastic-hardened supercow-leather.</p>
				<p>“What do you think of our planet now, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk?” Colonel Hickock asked.</p>
				<p>“Well, Colonel, your final message to the State was part of the briefing I received,” I replied. “I must say that I agree with your opinions. Especially with your opinion of local political practices. Politics is nothing, here, if not exciting and exacting.”</p>
				<p>“You don’t understand it though.” That was about half-question and half-statement. “Particularly our custom of using politicians as clay pigeons.”</p>
				<p>“Well, it is rather unusual.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“Yes.” The dryness in his tone was a paragraph of comment on my understatement. “And it’s fundamental to our system of government.</p>
				<p>“You were out all afternoon with Gail; you saw how we have to handle the supercow herds. Well, it is upon the fact that every rancher must have at his disposal a powerful force of aircraft and armor, easily convertible to military uses, that our political freedom rests. You see, our government is, in effect, an oligarchy of the big landowners and ranchers, who, in combination, have enough military power to overturn any Planetary government overnight. And, on the local level, it is a paternalistic feudalism.</p>
				<p>“That’s something that would have stood the hair of any Twentieth Century ‘Liberal’ on end. And it gives us the freest government anywhere in the galaxy.</p>
				<p>“There were a number of occasions, much less frequent now than formerly, when coalitions of big ranches combined their strength and marched on the Planetary government to protect their rights from government encroachment. This sort of thing could only be resorted to in defense of some inherent right, and never to infringe on the rights of others. Because, in the latter case, other armed coalitions would have arisen, as they did once or twice during the first three decades of New Texan history, to resist.</p>
				<p>“So the right of armed intervention by the people when the government invaded or threatened their rights became an acknowledged part of our political system.</p>
				<p>“And⁠—this arises as a natural consequence⁠—you can’t give a man with five hundred employees and a force of tanks and aircraft the right to resist the government, then at the same time deny that right to a man who has only his own pistol or machete.”</p>
				<p>“I notice the President and the other officials have themselves surrounded by guards to protect them from individual attack,” I said. “Why doesn’t the government, as such, protect itself with an army and air force large enough to resist any possible coalition of the big ranchers?”</p>
				<p>“<em>Because we won’t let the government get that strong!</em>” the Colonel said forcefully. “That’s one of the basic premises. We have no standing army, only the New Texas Rangers. And the legislature won’t authorize any standing army, or appropriate funds to support one. Any member of the legislature who tried it would get what Austin Maverick got, a couple of weeks ago, or what Sam Saltkin got, eight years ago, when he proposed a law for the compulsory registration and licensing of firearms. The opposition to that tax scheme of Maverick’s wasn’t because of what it would cost the public in taxes, but from fear of what the government could do with the money after they got it.</p>
				<p>“Keep a government poor and weak and it’s your servant; let it get rich and powerful and it’s your master. We don’t want any masters here on New Texas.”</p>
				<p>“But the President has a bodyguard,” I noted.</p>
				<p>“Casualty rate was too high,” Hickock explained. “Remember, the President’s job is inherently impossible: he has to represent <em>all</em> the people.”</p>
				<p>I thought that over, could see the illogical logic, but.⁠ ⁠… “How about your rancher oligarchy?”</p>
				<p>He laughed. “Son, if I started acting like a master around this ranch in the morning, they’d find my body in an irrigation ditch before sunset.</p>
				<p>“Sure, if you have a real army, you can keep the men under your thumb⁠—use one regiment or one division to put down mutiny in another. But when you have only five hundred men, all of whom know everybody else and all of them armed, you just act real considerate of them if you want to keep on living.”</p>
				<p>“Then would you say that the opposition to annexation comes from the people who are afraid that if New Texas enters the Solar League, there will be League troops sent here and this⁠ ⁠… this interesting system of insuring government responsibility to the public would be brought to an end?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. If you can show the people of this planet that the League won’t interfere with local political practices, you’ll have a 99.95 percent majority in favor of annexation. We’re too close to the z’Srauff star-cluster, out here, not to see the benefits of joining the Solar League.”</p>
				<p>We left the Hickock ranch on Sunday afternoon and while Hoddy guided our aircar back to New Austin, I had a little time to revise some of my ideas about New Texas. That is, I had time to think during those few moments when Hoddy wasn’t taking advantage of our diplomatic immunity to invent new air-ground traffic laws.</p>
				<p>My thoughts alternated between the pleasure of remembering Gail’s gay company and the gloom of understanding the complete implications of the Colonel’s clarifying lectures. Against the background of his remarks, I could find myself appreciating the Ghopal-Klüng-Natalenko reasoning: the only way to cut the Gordian knot was to have another Solar League Ambassador killed.</p>
				<p>And, whenever I could escape thinking about the fact that the next Ambassador to be the clay pigeon was me, I found myself wondering if I wanted the League to take over. Annexation, yes; New Texas customs would be protected under a treaty of annexation. But the “justified conquest” urged by Machiavelli, <abbr>Jr.</abbr>? No.</p>
				<p>I was still struggling with the problem when we reached the Embassy about 1700. Everyone was there, including Stonehenge, who had returned two hours earlier with the good news that the fleet had moved into position only sixty light-minutes off Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>. I had reached the point in my thinking where I had decided it was useless to keep Hoddy and Stonehenge apart except as an exercise in mental agility. Inasmuch as my brain was already weightlifting, swinging from a flying trapeze to elusive flying rings while doing triple somersaults and at the same time juggling seven Indian clubs, I skipped the whole matter.</p>
				<p>But I’m fairly certain that it wasn’t till then that Hoddy had a chance to deliver his letter-of-credence to Stonehenge.</p>
				<p>After dinner, we gathered in my office for our coffee and a final conference before the opening of the trial the next morning.</p>
				<p>Stonehenge spoke first, looking around the table at everyone except me.</p>
				<p>“No matter what happens, we have the fleet within call. Sir Rodney’s been active picking up those z’Srauff meteor-mining boats. They no longer have a tight screen around the system. We do. I don’t think that anyone, except us, knows that the fleet’s where it is.”</p>
				<p><q>No matter what happens</q>, I thought glumly, and the phrase explained why he hadn’t been able to look at me.</p>
				<p>“Well, boss, I gave you my end of it, comin’ in,” Hoddy said. “Want me to go over it again? All right. In Bonneyville, we found half a dozen people who can swear that Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney was making preparations to protect those three brothers an hour before Ambassador Cumshaw was shot. The whole town’s sorer than hell at Kettle-Belly for antagonizing the Hickock outfit and getting the place shot up the way it was. And we have witnesses that Kettle-Belly was in some kind of deal with the z’Srauff, too. The Rangers gathered up eight of them, who can swear to the preparations and to the fact that Kettle-Belly had z’Srauff visitors on different occasions before the shooting.”</p>
				<p>“That’s what we want,” Stonehenge said. “Something that’ll connect this murder with the z’Srauff.”</p>
				<p>“Well, wait till you hear what I’ve got,” Parros told him. “In the first place, we traced the gun and the aircar. The Bonney brothers bought them both from z’Srauff merchants, for ridiculously nominal prices. The merchant who sold the aircar is normally in the drygoods business, and the one who sold the auto-rifle runs a toy shop. In their whole lives, those three boys never had enough money among them to pay the list price of the gun, let alone the car. That is, not until a week before the murder.”</p>
				<p>“They got prosperous, all of a sudden?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Yes. Two weeks before the shooting, Kettle-Belly Sam’s bank account got a sudden transfusion: some anonymous benefactor deposited 250,000 pesos⁠—about a hundred thousand dollars⁠—to his credit. He drew out 75,000 of it and some of the money turned up again in the hands of Switchblade and Jack-High and Turkey-Buzzard. Then, a week before you landed here, he got another hundred thousand from the same anonymous source and he drew out twenty thousand of that. We think that was the money that went to pay for the attempted knife-job on Hutchinson. Two days before the barbecue, the waiter deposited a thousand at the New Austin Packers’ and Shippers’ Trust.”</p>
				<p>“Can you get that introduced as evidence at the trial?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Sure. Kettle-Belly banks at a town called Crooked Creek, about forty miles from Bonneyville. We have witnesses from the bank.</p>
				<p>“I also got the dope on the line the Bonney brothers are going to take at the trial. They have a lawyer, Clement <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Sidney, a member of what passes for the Socialist Party on this planet. The defense will take the line of full denial of everything. The Bonneys are just three poor but honest boys who are being framed by the corrupt tools of the Big Ranching Interests.”</p>
				<p>Hoddy made an impolite noise. “Whatta we got to worry about, then?” he demanded. “They’re a cinch for conviction.”</p>
				<p>“I agree with that,” Stonehenge said. “If they tried to base their defense on political conviction and opposition by the Solar League, they might have a chance. This way, they haven’t.”</p>
				<p>“All right, gentlemen,” I said, “I take it that we’re agreed that we must all follow a single line of policy and not work at cross-purposes to each other?”</p>
				<p>They all agreed to that instantly, but with a questioning note in their voices.</p>
				<p>“Well, then, I trust you all realize that we cannot, under any circumstances, allow those three brothers to be convicted in this court,” I added.</p>
				<p>There was a moment of startled silence, while Hoddy and Stonehenge and Parros and Thrombley were understanding what they had just heard. Then Stonehenge cleared his throat and said:</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador! I’m sure that you have some excellent reasons for that remarkable statement, but I must say⁠—”</p>
				<p>“It was a really colossal error on somebody’s part,” I said, “that this case was allowed to get into the Court of Political Justice. It never should have. And if we take a part in the prosecution, or allow those men to be convicted, we will establish a precedent to support the principle that a foreign Ambassador is, on this planet, defined as a practicing local politician.</p>
				<p>“I will invite you to digest that for a moment.”</p>
				<p>A moment was all they needed. Thrombley was horrified and dithered incoherently. Stonehenge frowned and fidgeted with some papers in front of him. I could see several thoughts gathering behind his eyes, including, I was sure, a new view of his instructions from Klüng.</p>
				<p>Even Hoddy got at least part of it. “Why, that means that anybody can bump off any diplomat he doesn’t like.⁠ ⁠…” he began.</p>
				<p>“That is only part of it, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ringo,” Thrombley told him. “It also means that a diplomat, instead of being regarded as the representative of his own government, becomes, in effect, a functionary of the government of New Texas. Why, all sorts of complications could arise.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“It certainly would impair, shall we say, the principle of extraterritoriality of Embassies,” Stonehenge picked it up. “And it would practically destroy the principle of diplomatic immunity.”</p>
				<p>“Migawd!” Hoddy looked around nervously, as though he could already hear an army of New Texas Rangers, each with a warrant for Hoddy Ringo, battering at the gates.</p>
				<p>“We’ll have to do something!” Gomez, the Secretary of the Embassy, said.</p>
				<p>“I don’t know what,” Stonehenge said. “The obvious solution would be, of course, to bring charges against those Bonney Boys on simple first-degree murder, which would be tried in an ordinary criminal court. But it’s too late for that now. We wouldn’t have time to prevent their being arraigned in this Political Justice court, and once a defendant is brought into court, on this planet, he cannot be brought into court again for the same act. Not the same <em>crime</em>, the same <em>act</em>.”</p>
				<p>I had been thinking about this and I was ready. “Look, we must bring those Bonney brothers to trial. It’s the only effective way of demonstrating to the public the simple fact that Ambassador Cumshaw was murdered at the instigation of the z’Srauff. We dare not allow them to be convicted in the Court of Political Justice, for the reasons already stated. And to maintain the prestige of the Solar League, we dare not allow them to go unpunished.”</p>
				<p>“We can have it one way,” Parros said, “and maybe we can have it two ways. But I’m damned if I can see how we can have it all three ways.”</p>
				<p>I wasn’t surprised that he didn’t see it; he hadn’t had the same urgency goading him which had forced me to find the answer. It wasn’t an answer that I liked, but I was in the position where I had no choice.</p>
				<p>“Well, here’s what we have to do, gentlemen,” I began, and from the respectful way they regarded me, from the attention they were giving my words, I got a sudden thrill of pride. For the first time since my scrambled arrival, I was really <em>Ambassador</em> Stephen Silk.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">VIII</h3>
				<p>A couple of New Texas Ranger tanks met the Embassy car four blocks from the Statehouse and convoyed us into the central plaza, where the barbecue had been held on the Friday afternoon that I had arrived on New Texas. There was almost as dense a crowd as the last time I had seen the place; but they were quieter, to the extent that there were no bands, and no shooting, no cowbells or whistles. The barbecue pits were going again, however, and hawkers were pushing or propelling their little wagons about, vending sandwiches. I saw a half a dozen big twenty-foot teleview screens, apparently wired from the courtroom.</p>
				<p>As soon as the Embassy car and its escorting tanks reached the plaza, an ovation broke out. I was cheered, with the high-pitched <em>yipeee!</em> of New Texans and adjured and implored not to let them so-and-sos get away with it.</p>
				<p>There was a veritable army of Rangers on guard at the doors of the courtroom. The only spectators being admitted to the courtroom seemed to be prominent citizens with enough pull to secure passes.</p>
				<p>Inside, some of the spectators’ benches had been removed to clear the front of the room. In the cleared space, there was one bulky shape under a cloth cover that seemed to be the aircar and another cloth-covered shape that looked like a fifty-<abbr>mm</abbr> dual-purpose gun. Smaller exhibits, including a twenty-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-rifle, were piled on the friends-of-the-court table. The prosecution table was already occupied⁠—Colonel Hickock, who waved a greeting to me, three or four men who looked like well-to-do ranchers, and a delegation of lawyers.</p>
				<p>“Samuel Goodham,” Parros, beside me, whispered, indicating a big, heavyset man with white hair, dressed in a dark suit of the cut that had been fashionable on Terra seventy-five years ago. “Best criminal lawyer on the planet. Hickock must have hired him.”</p>
				<p>There was quite a swarm at the center table, too. Some of them were ranchers, a couple in aggressively shabby workclothes, and there were several members of the Diplomatic Corps. I shook hands with them and gathered that they, like myself, were worried about the precedent that might be established by this trial. While I was introducing Hoddy Ringo as my attaché extraordinary, which was no less than the truth, the defense party came in.</p>
				<p>There were only three lawyers⁠—a little, rodent-faced fellow, whom Parros pointed out as Clement Sidney, and two assistants. And, guarded by a Ranger and a couple of court-bailiffs, the three defendants, Switchblade Joe, Jack-High Abe and Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney. There was probably a year or so age different from one to another, but they certainly had a common parentage. They all had pale eyes and narrow, loose-lipped faces. Subnormal and probably psychopathic, I thought. Jack-High Abe had his left arm in a sling and his left shoulder in a plaster cast. The buzz of conversation among the spectators altered its tone subtly and took on a note of hostility as they entered and seated themselves.</p>
				<p>The balcony seemed to be crowded with press representatives. Several telecast cameras and sound pickups had been rigged to cover the front of the room from various angles, a feature that had been missing from the trial I had seen with Gail on Friday.</p>
				<p>Then the judges entered from a door behind the bench, which must have opened from a passageway under the plaza, and the court was called to order.</p>
				<p>The President Judge was the same Nelson who had presided at the Whately trial and the first thing on the agenda seemed to be the selection of a new board of associate judges. Parros explained in a whisper that the board which had served on the previous trial would sit until that could be done.</p>
				<p>A slip of paper was drawn from a box and a name was called. A man sitting on one of the front rows of spectators’ seats got up and came forward. One of Sidney’s assistants rummaged through a card file he had in front of him and handed a card to the chief of the defense. At once, Sidney was on his feet.</p>
				<p>“Challenged, for cause!” he called out. “This man is known to have declared, in conversation at the bar of the Silver Peso Saloon, here in New Austin, that these three boys, my clients, ought all to be hanged higher than Haman.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, I said that!” the venireman declared. “I’ll repeat it right here: all three of these murdering skunks ought to be hanged higher than⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Your Honor!” Sidney almost screamed. “If, after hearing this man’s brazen declaration of bigoted class hatred against my clients, he is allowed to sit on that bench⁠—”</p>
				<p>Judge Nelson pounded with his gavel. “You don’t have to instruct me in my judicial duties, Counselor,” he said. “The venireman has obviously disqualified himself by giving evidence of prejudice. Next name.”</p>
				<p>The next man was challenged: he was a retired packinghouse operator in New Austin, and had once expressed the opinion that Bonneyville and everybody in it ought to be <abbr>H</abbr>-bombed off the face of New Texas.</p>
				<p>This Sidney seemed to have gotten the name of everybody likely to be called for court duty and had something on each one of them, because he went on like that all morning.</p>
				<p>“You know what I think,” Stonehenge whispered to me, leaning over behind Parros. “I think he’s just stalling to keep the court in session until the z’Srauff fleet gets here. I wish we could get hold of one of those wrist watches.”</p>
				<p>“I can get you one, before evening,” Hoddy offered, “if you don’t care what happens to the mutt that’s wearin’ it.”</p>
				<p>“Better not,” I decided. “Might tip them off to what we suspect. And we don’t really need one: Sir Rodney will have patrols out far enough to get warning in time.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>We took an hour, at noon, for lunch, and then it began again. By 1647, fifteen minutes before court should be adjourned, Judge Nelson ordered the bailiff to turn the clock back to 1300. The clock was turned back again when it reached 1645. By this time, Clement Sidney was probably the most unpopular man on New Texas.</p>
				<p>Finally, Colonel Andrew <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> Hickock rose to his feet.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor: the present court is not obliged to retire from the bench until another court has been chosen as they are now sitting as a court in being. I propose that the trial begin, with the present court on the bench.”</p>
				<p>Sidney began yelling protests. Hoddy Ringo pulled his neckerchief around under his left ear and held the ends above his head. Nanadabadian, the Ambassador from Beta Cephus <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, drew his biggest knife and began trying the edge on a sheet of paper.</p>
				<p>“Well, Your Honor, I certainly do not wish to act in an obstructionist manner. The defense agrees to accept the present court,” Sidney decided.</p>
				<p>“Prosecution agrees to accept the present court,” Goodham parroted.</p>
				<p>“The present court will continue on the bench, to try the case of the Friends of Silas Cumshaw, deceased, versus Switchblade Joe Bonney, Jack-High Abe Bonney, Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney, et als.” Judge Nelson rapped with his gavel. “Court is herewith adjourned until 0900 tomorrow.”</p>
			</section>
			<section id="lone-star-planet-9" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">IX</h3>
				<p>The trial got started the next morning with a minimum amount of objections from Sidney. The charges and specifications were duly read, the three defendants pleaded not guilty, and then Goodham advanced with a paper in his hand to address the court. Sidney scampered up to take his position beside him.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor, the prosecution wishes, subject to agreement of the defense, to enter the following stipulations, to wit: First, that the late Silas Cumshaw was a practicing politician within the meaning of the law. Second, that he is now dead, and came to his death in the manner attested to by the coroner of Sam Houston Continent. Third, that he came to his death at the hands of the defendants here present.”</p>
				<p>In all my planning, I’d forgotten that. I couldn’t let those stipulations stand without protest, and at the same time, if I protested the characterization of Cumshaw as a practicing politician, the trial could easily end right there. So I prayed for a miracle, and Clement Sidney promptly obliged me.</p>
				<p>“Defense won’t stipulate anything!” he barked. “My clients, here, are victims of a monstrous conspiracy, a conspiracy to conceal the true facts of the death of Silas Cumshaw. They ought never to have been arrested or brought here, and if the prosecution wants to establish anything, they can do it by testimony, in the regular and lawful way. This practice of freewheeling stipulation is only one of the many devices by which the courts of this planet are being perverted to serve the corrupt and unjust ends of a gang of reactionary landowners!”</p>
				<p>Judge Nelson’s gavel hit the bench with a crack like a rifle shot.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney! In justice to your clients, I would hate to force them to change lawyers in the middle of their trial, but if I hear another remark like that about the courts of New Texas, that’s exactly what will happen, because you’ll be in jail for contempt! Is that clear, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney?”</p>
				<p>I settled back with a deep sigh of relief which got me, I noticed, curious stares from my fellow Ambassadors. I disregarded the questions in their glances; I had what I wanted.</p>
				<p>They began calling up the witnesses.</p>
				<p>First, the doctor who had certified Ambassador Cumshaw’s death. He gave a concise description of the wounds which had killed my predecessor. Sidney was trying to make something out of the fact that he was Hickock’s family physician, and consuming more time, when I got up.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor, I am present here as amicus curiae, because of the obvious interest which the Government of the Solar League has in this case.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“Objection!” Sidney yelled.</p>
				<p>“Please state it,” Nelson invited.</p>
				<p>“This is a court of the people of the planet of New Texas. This foreign emissary of the Solar League, sent here to conspire with New Texan traitors to the end that New Texans shall be reduced to a supine and ravished satrapy of the all-devouring empire of the Galaxy⁠—”</p>
				<p>Judge Nelson rapped sharply.</p>
				<p>“Friends of the court are defined as persons having a proper interest in the case. As this case arises from the death of the former Ambassador of the Solar League, I cannot see how the present Ambassador and his staff can be excluded. Overruled.” He nodded to me. “Continue, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador.”</p>
				<p>“As I understand, I have the same rights of cross-examination of witnesses as counsel for the prosecution and defense; is that correct, Your Honor?” It was, so I turned to the witness. “I suppose, Doctor, that you have had quite a bit of experience, in your practice, with gunshot wounds?”</p>
				<p>He chuckled. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador, it is gunshot-wound cases which keep the practice of medicine and surgery alive on this planet. Yes, I definitely have.”</p>
				<p>“Now, you say that the deceased was hit by six different projectiles: right shoulder almost completely severed, right lung and right ribs blown out of the chest, spleen and kidneys so intermingled as to be practically one, and left leg severed by complete shattering of the left pelvis and hip-joint?”</p>
				<p>“That’s right.”</p>
				<p>I picked up the 20-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-rifle⁠—it weighed a good sixty pounds⁠—from the table, and asked him if this weapon could have inflicted such wounds. He agreed that it both could and had.</p>
				<p>“This the usual type of weapon used in your New Texas political liquidations?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Certainly not. The usual weapons are pistols; sometimes a hunting-rifle or a shotgun.”</p>
				<p>I asked the same question when I cross-examined the ballistics witness.</p>
				<p>“Is this the usual type of weapon used in your New Texas political liquidations?”</p>
				<p>“No, not at all. That’s a very expensive weapon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador. Wasn’t even manufactured on this planet; made by the z’Srauff star-cluster. A weapon like that sells for five, six hundred pesos. It’s used for shooting really big game⁠—supermastodon, and things like that. And, of course, for combat.”</p>
				<p>“It seems,” I remarked, “that the defense is overlooking an obvious point there. I doubt if these three defendants ever, in all their lives, had among them the price of such a weapon.”</p>
				<p>That, of course, brought Sidney to his feet, sputtering objections to this attempt to disparage the honest poverty of his clients, which only helped to call attention to the point.</p>
				<p>Then the prosecution called in a witness named David Crockett Longfellow. I’d met him at the Hickock ranch; he was Hickock’s butler. He limped from an old injury which had retired him from work on the range. He was sworn in and testified to his name and occupation.</p>
				<p>“Do you know these three defendants?” Goodham asked him.</p>
				<p>“Yeah. I even marked one of them for future identification,” Longfellow replied.</p>
				<p>Sidney was up at once, shouting objections. After he was quieted down, Goodham remarked that he’d come to that point later, and began a line of questioning to establish that Longfellow had been on the Hickock ranch on the day when Silas Cumshaw was killed.</p>
				<p>“Now,” Goodham said, “will you relate to the court the matters of interest which came to your personal observation on that day.”</p>
				<p>Longfellow began his story. “At about 0900, I was dustin’ up and straightenin’ things in the library while the Colonel was at his desk. All of a sudden, he said to me, ‘Davy, suppose you call the Solar Embassy and see if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw is doin’ anything today; if he isn’t, ask him if he wants to come out.’ I was workin’ right beside the telescreen. So I called the Solar League Embassy. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley took the call, and I asked him was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw around. By this time, the Colonel got through with what he was doin’ at the desk and came over to the screen. I went back to my work, but I heard the Colonel askin’ <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw could he come out for the day, an’ <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw sayin,’ yes, he could; he’d be out by about 1030.</p>
				<p>“Well, ’long about 1030, his aircar came in and landed on the drive. Little single-seat job that he drove himself. He landed it about a hundred feet from the outside veranda, like he usually did, and got out.</p>
				<p>“Then, this other car came droppin’ in from outa nowhere. I didn’t pay it much attention; thought it might be one of the other Ambassadors that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw’d brung along. But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw turned around and looked at it, and then he started to run for the veranda. I was standin’ in the doorway when I seen him startin’ to run. I jumped out on the porch, quick-like, and pulled my gun, and then this auto-rifle begun firin’ outa the other car. There was only eight or ten shots fired from this car, but most of them hit <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw.”</p>
				<p>Goodham waited a few moments. Longfellow’s voice had choked and there was a twitching about his face, as though he were trying to suppress tears.</p>
				<p>“Now, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Longfellow,” Goodham said, “did you recognize the people who were in the car from which the shots came?”</p>
				<p>“Yeah. Like I said, I cut a mark on one of them. That one there: Jack-High Abe Bonney. He was handlin’ the gun, and from where I was, he had his left side to me. I was tryin’ for his head, but I always overshoot, so I have the habit of holdin’ low. This time I held too low.” He looked at Jack-High in coldly poisonous hatred. “I’ll be sorry about that as long as I live.”</p>
				<p>“And who else was in the car?”</p>
				<p>“The other two curs outa the same litter: Switchblade an’ Turkey-Buzzard, over there.”</p>
				<p>Further questioning revealed that Longfellow had had no direct knowledge of the pursuit, or the siege of the jail in Bonneyville. Colonel Hickock had taken personal command of that, and had left Longfellow behind to call the Solar League Embassy and the Rangers. He had made no attempt to move the body, but had left it lying in the driveway until the doctor and the Rangers arrived.</p>
				<p>Goodham went to the middle table and picked up a heavy automatic pistol.</p>
				<p>“I call the court’s attention to this pistol. It is an eleven-<abbr>mm</abbr> automatic, manufactured by the Colt Firearms Company of New Texas, a licensed subsidiary of the Colt Firearms Company of Terra.” He handed it to Longfellow. “Do you know this pistol?” he asked.</p>
				<p>Longfellow was almost insulted by the question. Of course he knew his own pistol. He recited the serial number, and pointed to different scars and scratches on the weapon, telling how they had been acquired.</p>
				<p>“The court accepts that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Longfellow knows his own weapon,” Nelson said. “I assume that this is the weapon with which you claim to have shot Jack-High Abe Bonney?”</p>
				<p>It was, although Longfellow resented the qualification.</p>
				<p>“That’s all. Your witness, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney,” Goodham said.</p>
				<p>Sidney began an immediate attack.</p>
				<p>Questioning Longfellow’s eyesight, intelligence, honesty and integrity, he tried to show personal enmity toward the Bonneys. He implied that Longfellow had been conspiring with Cumshaw to bring about the conquest of New Texas by the Solar League. The verbal exchange became so heated that both witness and attorney had to be admonished repeatedly from the bench. But at no point did Sidney shake Longfellow from his one fundamental statement, that the Bonney brothers had shot Silas Cumshaw and that he had shot Jack-High Abe Bonney in the shoulder.</p>
				<p>When he was finished, I got up and took over.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Longfellow, you say that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley answered the screen at the Solar League Embassy,” I began. “You know <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley?”</p>
				<p>“Sure, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk. He’s been out at the ranch with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw a lotta times.”</p>
				<p>“Well, beside yourself and Colonel Hickock and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw and, possibly, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley, who else knew that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw would be at the ranch at 1030 on that morning?”</p>
				<p>Nobody. But the aircar had obviously been waiting for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw; the Bonneys must have had advance knowledge. My questions made that point clear despite the obvious⁠—and reluctantly court-sustained⁠—objections from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney.</p>
				<p>“That will be all, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Longfellow; thank you. Any questions from anybody else?”</p>
				<p>There being none, Longfellow stepped down. It was then a few minutes before noon, so Judge Nelson recessed court for an hour and a half.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>In the afternoon, the surgeon who had treated Jack-High Abe Bonney’s wounded shoulder testified, identifying the bullet which had been extracted from Bonney’s shoulder. A ballistics man from Ranger crime-lab followed him to the stand and testified that it had been fired from Longfellow’s Colt. Then Ranger Captain Nelson took the stand. His testimony was about what he had given me at the Embassy, with the exception that the Bonneys’ admission that they had shot Ambassador Cumshaw was ruled out as having been made under duress.</p>
				<p>However, Captain Nelson’s testimony didn’t need the confessions.</p>
				<p>The cover was stripped off the aircar, and a couple of men with a power-dolly dragged it out in front of the bench. The Ranger Captain identified it as the car which he had found at the Bonneyville jail. He went over it with an ultraviolet flashlight and showed where he had written his name and the date on it with fluorescent ink. The effects of <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">A.A.</abbr>-fire were plainly evident on it.</p>
				<p>Then the other shrouded object was unveiled and identified as the gun which had disabled the aircar. Colonel Hickock identified the gun as the one with which he had fired on the aircar. Finally, the ballistics expert was brought back to the stand again, to link the two by means of fragments found in the car.</p>
				<p>Then Goodham brought Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney to the stand.</p>
				<p>The Mayor of Bonneyville was a man of fifty or so, short, partially bald, dressed in faded blue Levis, a frayed white shirt, and a grease-spotted vest. There was absolutely no mystery about how he had acquired his nickname. He disgorged a cud of tobacco into a spittoon, took the oath with unctuous solemnity, then reloaded himself with another chew and told his version of the attack on the jail.</p>
				<p>At about 1045 on the day in question, he testified, he had been in his office, hard at work in the public service, when an aircar, partially disabled by gunfire, had landed in the street outside and the three defendants had rushed in, claiming sanctuary. From then on, the story flowed along smoothly, following the lines predicted by Captain Nelson and Parros. Of course he had given the fugitives shelter; they had claimed to have been near to a political assassination and were in fear of their lives.</p>
				<p>Under Sidney’s cross-examination, and coaching, he poured out the story of Bonneyville’s wrongs at the hands of the reactionary landowners, and the atrocious behavior of the Hickock goon-gang. Finally, after extracting the last drop of class-hatred venom out of him, Sidney turned him over to me.</p>
				<p>“How many men were inside the jail when the three defendants came claiming sanctuary?” I asked.</p>
				<p>He couldn’t rightly say, maybe four or five.</p>
				<p>“Closer twenty-five, according to the Rangers. How many of them were prisoners in the jail?”</p>
				<p>“Well, none. The prisoners was all turned out that mornin.’ They was just common drunks, disorderly conduct cases, that kinda thing. We turned them out so’s we could make some repairs.”</p>
				<p>“You turned them out because you expected to have to defend the jail; because you knew in advance that these three would be along claiming sanctuary, and that Colonel Hickock’s ranch hands would be right on their heels, didn’t you?” I demanded.</p>
				<p>It took a good five minutes before Sidney stopped shouting long enough for Judge Nelson to sustain the objection.</p>
				<p>“You knew these young men all their lives, I take it. What did you know about their financial circumstances, for instance?”</p>
				<p>“Well, they’ve been ground down an’ kept poor by the big ranchers an’ the money-guys.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“Then weren’t you surprised to see them driving such an expensive aircar?”</p>
				<p>“I don’t know as it’s such an expensive⁠—” he shut his mouth suddenly.</p>
				<p>“You know where they got the money to buy that car?” I pressed.</p>
				<p>Kettle-Belly Sam didn’t answer.</p>
				<p>“From the man who paid them to murder Ambassador Silas Cumshaw?” I kept pressing. “Do you know how much they were paid for that job? Do you know where the money came from? Do you know who the go-between was, and how much he got, and how much he kept for himself? Was it the same source that paid for the recent attempt on President Hutchinson’s life?”</p>
				<p>“I refuse to answer!” the witness declared, trying to shove his chest out about half as far as his midriff. “On the grounds that it might incriminate or degrade me!”</p>
				<p>“You can’t degrade a Bonney!” a voice from the balcony put in.</p>
				<p>“So then,” I replied to the voice, “what he means is, incriminate.” I turned to the witness. “That will be all. Excused.”</p>
				<p>As Bonney left the stand and was led out the side door, Goodham addressed the bench.</p>
				<p>“Now, Your Honor,” he said, “I believe that the prosecution has succeeded in definitely establishing that these three defendants actually did fire the shot which, on <time datetime="2193-04-22">April 22, 2193</time>, deprived Silas Cumshaw of his life. We will now undertake to prove.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>Followed a long succession of witnesses, each testifying to some public or private act of philanthropy, some noble trait of character. It was the sort of thing which the defense lawyer in the Whately case had been so willing to stipulate. Sidney, of course, tried to make it all out to be part of a sinister conspiracy to establish a Solar League fifth column on New Texas. Finally, the prosecution rested its case.</p>
				<p>I entertained Gail and her father at the Embassy, that evening. The street outside was crowded with New Texans, all of them on our side, shouting slogans like, “Death to the Bonneys!” and “Vengeance for Cumshaw!” and “Annexation Now!” Some of it was entirely spontaneous, too. The Hickocks, father and daughter, were given a tremendous ovation, when they finally left, and followed to their hotel by cheering crowds. I saw one big banner, lettered: <b>Don’t Let New Texas Go to the Dogs</b> and bearing a crude picture of a z’Srauff. I seemed to recall having seen a couple of our Marines making that banner the evening before in the Embassy patio, but.⁠ ⁠…</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">X</h3>
				<p>The next morning, the third of the trial, opened with the defense witnesses, character-witnesses for the three killers and witnesses to the political iniquities of Silas Cumshaw.</p>
				<p>Neither Goodham nor I bothered to cross-examine the former. I couldn’t see how any lawyer as shrewd as Sidney had shown himself to be would even dream of getting such an array of thugs, cutthroats, sluts and slatterns into court as character witnesses for anybody.</p>
				<p>The latter, on the other hand, we went after unmercifully, revealing, under their enmity for Cumshaw, a small, hard core of bigoted xenophobia and selfish fear. Goodham did a beautiful job on that; he seemed able, at a glance, to divine exactly what each witness’s motivation was, and able to make him or her betray that motivation in its least admirable terms. Finally the defense rested, about a quarter-hour before noon.</p>
				<p>I rose and addressed the court:</p>
				<p>“Your Honor, while both the prosecution and the defense have done an admirable job in bringing out the essential facts of how my predecessor met his death, there are many features about this case which are far from clear to me. They will be even less clear to my government, which is composed of men who have never set foot on this planet. For this reason, I wish to call, or recall, certain witnesses to clarify these points.”</p>
				<p>Sidney, who had begun shouting objections as soon as I had gotten to my feet, finally managed to get himself recognized by the court.</p>
				<p>“This Solar League Ambassador, Your Honor, is simply trying to use the courts of the Planet of New Texas as a sounding-board for his imperialistic government’s propaganda.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>“You may reassure yourself, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney,” Judge Nelson said. “This court will not allow itself to be improperly used, or improperly swayed, by the Ambassador of the Solar League. This court is interested only in determining the facts regarding the case before it. You may call your witnesses, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador.” He glanced at his watch. “Court will now recess for an hour and a half; can you have them here by 1330?”</p>
				<p>I assured him I could after glancing across the room at Ranger Captain Nelson and catching his nod.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>My first witness, that afternoon was Thrombley. After the formalities of getting his name and connection with the Solar League Embassy on the record, I asked him, “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Thrombley, did you, on the morning of April 22, receive a call from the Hickock ranch for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, indeed, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador. The call was from <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Longfellow, Colonel Hickock’s butler. He asked if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw were available. It happened that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw was in the same room with me, and he came directly to the screen. Then Colonel Hickock appeared in the screen, and inquired if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw could come out to the ranch for the day; he said something about superdove shooting.”</p>
				<p>“You heard <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw tell Colonel Hickock that he would be out at the ranch at about 1030?” Thrombley said he had. “And, to your knowledge, did anybody else at the Embassy hear that?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no, sir; we were in the Ambassador’s private office, and the screen there is tap-proof.”</p>
				<p>“And what other calls did you receive, prior to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw’s death?”</p>
				<p>“About fifteen minutes after <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw had left, the z’Srauff Ambassador called, about a personal matter. As he was most anxious to contact <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw, I told him where he had gone.”</p>
				<p>“Then, to your knowledge, outside of yourself, Colonel Hickock, and his butler, the z’Srauff Ambassador was the only person who could have known that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw’s car would be landing on Colonel Hickock’s drive at or about 1030. Is that correct?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, plus anybody whom the z’Srauff Ambassador might have told.”</p>
				<p>“Exactly!” I pounced. Then I turned and gave the three Bonney brothers a sweeping glance. “Plus anybody the z’Srauff Ambassador might have told.⁠ ⁠… That’s all. Your witness, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney.”</p>
				<p>Sidney got up, started toward the witness stand, and then thought better of it.</p>
				<p>“No questions,” he said.</p>
				<p>The next witness was a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> James Finnegan; he was identified as cashier of the Crooked Creek National Bank. I asked him if Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney did business at his bank; he said yes.</p>
				<p>“Anything unusual about Mayor Bonney’s account?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Well, it’s been unusually active lately. Ordinarily, he carries around two-three thousand pesos, but about the first of April, that took a big jump. Quite a big jump; two hundred and fifty thousand pesos, all in a lump.”</p>
				<p>“When did Kettle-Belly Sam deposit this large sum?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“He didn’t. The money came to us in a cashier’s check on the Ranchers’ Trust Company of New Austin with an anonymous letter asking that it be deposited to Mayor Bonney’s account. The letter was typed on a sheet of yellow paper in Basic English.”</p>
				<p>“Do you have that letter now?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“No, I don’t. After we’d recorded the new balance, Kettle-Belly came storming in, raising hell because we’d recorded it. He told me that if we ever got another deposit like that, we were to turn it over to him in cash. Then he wanted to see the letter, and when I gave it to him, he took it over to a telescreen booth, and drew the curtains. I got a little busy with some other matters, and the next time I looked, Kettle-Belly was gone and some girl was using the booth.”</p>
				<p>“That’s very interesting, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Finnegan. Was that the last of your unusual business with Mayor Bonney?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no. Then, about two weeks before <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cumshaw was killed, Kettle-Belly came in and wanted 50,000 pesos, in a big hurry, in small bills. I gave it to him, and he grabbed at the money like a starved dog at a bone, and upset a bottle of red perma-ink, the sort we use to refill our bank seals. Three of the bills got splashed. I offered to exchange them, but he said, ‘Hell with it; I’m in a hurry,’ and went out. The next day, Switchblade Joe Bonney came in to make payment on a note we were holding on him. He used those three bills in the payment.</p>
				<p>“Then, about a week ago, there was another cashier’s check came in for Kettle-Belly. This time, there was no letter; just one of our regular deposit-slips. No name of depositor. I held the check, and gave it to Kettle-Belly. I remember, when it came in, I said to one of the clerks, ‘Well, I wonder who’s going to get bumped off this time.’ And sure enough.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
				<p>Sidney’s yell of, “Objection!” was all his previous objections gathered into one.</p>
				<p>“You say the letter accompanying the first deposit, the one in Basic English, was apparently taken away by Kettle-Belly Sam Bonney. If you saw another letter of the same sort, would you be able to say whether or not it might be like the one you mentioned?”</p>
				<p>Sidney vociferating more objections; I was trying to get expert testimony without previous qualification.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>“Not at all, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney,” Judge Nelson ruled. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk has merely asked if <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Finnegan could say whether one document bore any resemblance to another.”</p>
				<p>I asked permission to have another witness sworn in while Finnegan was still on the stand, and called in a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Boone, the cashier of the Packers’ and Brokers’ Trust Company of New Austin. He had with him a letter, typed on yellow paper, which he said had accompanied an anonymous deposit of two hundred thousand pesos. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Finnegan said that it was exactly like the one he had received, in typing, grammar and wording, all but the name of the person to whose account the money was to be deposited.</p>
				<p>“And whose account received this anonymous benefaction, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Boone?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“The account,” Boone replied, “of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Clement Sidney.”</p>
				<p>I was surprised that Judge Nelson didn’t break the handle of his gavel, after that. Finally, after a couple of threats to clear the court, order was restored. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Sidney had no questions to ask this time, either.</p>
				<p>The bailiff looked at the next slip of paper I gave him, frowned over it, and finally asked the court for assistance.</p>
				<p>“I can’t pronounce this-here thing, at all,” he complained.</p>
				<p>One of the judges finally got out a mouthful of growls and yaps, and gave it to the clerk of the court to copy into the record. The next witness was a z’Srauff, and in the New Texan garb he was wearing, he was something to open my eyes, even after years on the Hooligan Diplomats.</p>
				<p>After he took the stand, the clerk of the court looked at him blankly for a moment. Then he turned to Judge Nelson.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor, how am I gonna go about swearing him in?” he asked. “What does a z’Srauff swear by, that’s binding?”</p>
				<p>The President Judge frowned for a moment. “Does anybody here know Basic well enough to translate the oath?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“I think I can,” I offered. “I spent a great many years in our Consular Service, before I was sent here. We use Basic with a great many alien peoples.”</p>
				<p>“Administer the oath, then,” Nelson told me.</p>
				<p>“Put up right hand,” I told the z’Srauff. “Do you truly say, in front of Great One who made all worlds, who has knowledge of what is in the hearts of all persons, that what you will say here will be true, all true, and not anything that is not true, and will you so say again at time when all worlds end? Do you so truly say?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. I so truly say.”</p>
				<p>“Say your name.”</p>
				<p>“Ppmegll Kkuvtmmecc Cicici.”</p>
				<p>“What is your business?”</p>
				<p>“I put things made of cloth into this world, and I take meat out of this world.”</p>
				<p>“Where do you have your house?”</p>
				<p>“Here in New Austin, over my house of business, on Coronado Street.”</p>
				<p>“What people do you see in this place that you have made business with?”</p>
				<p>Ppmegll Kkuvtmmecc Cicici pointed a three-fingered hand at the Bonney brothers.</p>
				<p>“What business did you make with them?”</p>
				<p>“I gave them for money a machine which goes on the ground and goes in the air very fast, to take persons and things about.”</p>
				<p>“Is that the thing you gave them for money?” I asked, pointing at the exhibit aircar.</p>
				<p>“Yes, but it was new then. It has been made broken by things from guns now.”</p>
				<p>“What money did they give you for the machine?”</p>
				<p>“One hundred pesos.”</p>
				<p>That started another uproar. There wasn’t a soul in that courtroom who didn’t know that five thousand pesos would have been a giveaway bargain price for that car.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ambassador,” one of the associate judges interrupted. “I used to be in the used-car business. Am I expected to believe that this⁠ ⁠… this being⁠ ⁠… sold that aircar for a hundred pesos?”</p>
				<p>“Here’s a notarized copy of the bill of sale, from the office of the Vehicles Registration Bureau,” I said. “I introduce it as evidence.”</p>
				<p>There was a disturbance at the back of the room, and then the z’Srauff Ambassador, Gglafrr Ddespttann Vuvuvu, came stalking down the aisle, followed by a couple of Rangers and two of his attachés. He came forward and addressed the court.</p>
				<p>“May you be happy, sir, but I am in here so quickly not because I have desire to make noise, but because it is only short time since it got in my knowledge that one of my persons is in this place. I am here to be of help to him that he not get in trouble, and to be of help to you. The name for what I am to do in this place is not part of my knowledge. Please say it for me.”</p>
				<p>“You are a friend of the court,” Judge Nelson told him. “An amicus curiae.”</p>
				<p>“You make me happy. Please go on; I have no desire to put stop to what you do in this place.”</p>
				<p>“From what person did you get this machine that you gave to these persons for one hundred pesos?” I asked.</p>
				<p>Gglafrr immediately began barking and snarling and yelping at my witness. The drygoods importer looked startled, and Judge Nelson banged with his gavel.</p>
				<p>“That’s enough of that! There’ll be nothing spoken in this court but English, except through an interpreter!”</p>
				<p>“Yow! I am sad that what I did was not right,” the z’Srauff Ambassador replied contritely. “But my person here has not as part of his knowledge that you will make him say what may put him in trouble.”</p>
				<p>Nelson nodded in agreement.</p>
				<p>“You are right: this person who is here has no need to make answer to any question if it may put him in trouble or make him seem less than he is.”</p>
				<p>“I will not make answer,” the witness said.</p>
				<p>“No further questions.”</p>
				<p>I turned to Goodham, and then to Sidney; they had no questions, either. I handed another slip of paper to the bailiff, and another z’Srauff, named Bbrarkk Jjoknyyegg Kekeke took the stand.</p>
				<p>He put into this world things for small persons to make amusement with; he took out of this world meat and leather. He had his house of business in New Austin, and he pointed out the three Bonneys as persons in this place that he saw that he had seen before.</p>
				<p>“And what business did you make with them?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“I gave them for money a gun which sends out things of twenty-millimeters very fast, to make death or hurt come to men and animals and does destruction to machines and things.”</p>
				<p>“Is this the gun?” I showed it to him.</p>
				<p>“It could be. The gun was made in my world; many guns like it are made there. I am certain that this is the very gun.”</p>
				<p>I had a notarized copy of a customs house bill in which the gun was described and specified by serial number. I introduced it as evidence.</p>
				<p>“How much money did these three persons give you for this gun?” I asked.</p>
				<p>“Five pesos.”</p>
				<p>“The customs appraisal on this gun is six hundred pesos,” I mentioned.</p>
				<p>Immediately, Ambassador Vuvuvu was on his feet. “My person here has not as part of his knowledge that he may put himself in trouble by what he says to answer these questions.”</p>
				<p>That put a stop to that. Bbrarkk Jjoknyyegg Kekeke immediately took refuge in refusal to answer on grounds of self-incrimination.</p>
				<p>“That is all, Your Honor,” I said, “And now,” I continued, when the witness had left the stand, “I have something further to present to the court, speaking both as amicus curiae and as Ambassador of the Solar League. This court cannot convict the three men who are here on trial. These men should have never been brought to trial in this court: it has no jurisdiction over this case. This was a simple case of first-degree murder, by hired assassins, committed against the Ambassador of one government at the instigation of another, not an act of political protest within the meaning of New Texan law.”</p>
				<p>There was a brief silence; both the court and the spectators were stunned, and most stunned of all were the three Bonney brothers, who had been watching, fear-sick, while I had been putting a rope around their necks. The uproar from the rear of the courtroom gave Judge Nelson a needed minute or so to collect his thoughts. After he had gotten order restored, he turned to me, grim-faced.</p>
				<p>“Ambassador Silk, will you please elaborate on the extraordinary statement you have just made,” he invited, as though every word had sharp corners that were sticking in his throat.</p>
				<p>“Gladly, Your Honor.” My words, too, were gouging and scraping my throat as they came out; I could feel my knees getting absurdly weak, and my mouth tasted as though I had an old copper penny in it.</p>
				<p>“As I understand it, the laws of New Texas do not extend their ordinary protection to persons engaged in the practice of politics. An act of personal injury against a politician is considered criminal only to the extent that the politician injured has not, by his public acts, deserved the degree of severity with which he has been injured, and the Court of Political Justice is established for the purpose of determining whether or not there has been such an excess of severity in the treatment meted out by the accused to the injured or deceased politician. This gives rise, of course, to some interesting practices; for instance, what is at law a trial of the accused is, in substance, a trial of his victim. But in any case tried in this court, the accused must be a person who has injured or killed a man who is definable as a practicing politician under the government of New Texas.</p>
				<p>“Speaking for my government, I must deny that these men should have been tried in this court for the murder of Silas Cumshaw. To do otherwise would establish the principle and precedent that our Ambassador, or any other Ambassador here, is a practicing politician under⁠—mark that well, Your Honor⁠—under the laws and government of New Texas. This would not only make of any Ambassador a permissable target for any marksman who happened to disapprove of the policies of another government, but more serious, it would place the Ambassador and his government in a subordinate position relative to the government of New Texas. This the government of the Solar League simply cannot tolerate, for reasons which it would be insulting to the intelligence of this court to enumerate.”</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” Judge Nelson said gravely. “This court takes full cognizance of the force of your arguments. However, I’d like to know why you permitted this trial to run to this length before entering this objection. Surely you could have made clear the position of your government at the beginning of this trial.”</p>
				<p>“Your Honor,” I said, “had I done so, these defendants would have been released, and the facts behind their crime would have never come to light. I grant that the important function of this court is to determine questions of relative guilt and innocence. We must not lose sight, however, of the fact that the primary function of any court is to determine the truth, and only by the process of the trial of these depraved murderers-for-hire could the real author of the crime be uncovered.</p>
				<p>“This was important, both for the government of the Solar League and the government of New Texas. My government now knows who procured the death of Silas Cumshaw, and we will take appropriate action. The government of New Texas has now had spelled out, in letters anyone can read, the fact that this beautiful planet is in truth a <em>battleground</em>. Awareness of this may save New Texas from being the scene of a larger and more destructive battle. New Texas also knows who are its enemies, and who can be counted upon to stand as its friends.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vuvuvu, I haven’t heard any comment from you.⁠ ⁠… No comment? Well, we’ll have to close the court, to consider this phase of the question.”</p>
				<p>The black screen slid up, for the second time during the trial. There was silence for a moment, and then the room became a bubbling pot of sound. At least six fights broke out among the spectators within three minutes; the Rangers and court bailiffs were busy restoring order.</p>
				<p>Gail Hickock, who had been sitting on the front row of the spectators’ seats, came running up while I was still receiving the congratulations of my fellow diplomats.</p>
				<p>“Stephen! How <em>could</em> you?” she demanded. “You know what you’ve done? You’ve gotten those murdering snakes turned loose!”</p>
				<p>Andrew Jackson Hickock left the prosecution table and approached.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk! You’ve just secured the freedom of three men who murdered one of my best friends!”</p>
				<p>“Colonel Hickock, I believe I knew Silas Cumshaw before you did. He was one of my instructors at Dumbarton Oaks, and I have always had the deepest respect and admiration for him. But he taught me one thing, which you seem to have forgotten since you expatriated yourself⁠—that in the Diplomatic Service, personal feelings don’t count. The only thing of importance is the advancement of the policies of the Solar League.”</p>
				<p>“Silas and I were attachés together, at the old Embassy at Drammool, on Altair <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>,” Colonel Hickock said. What else he might have said was lost in the sudden exclamation as the black screen slid down. In front of Judge Nelson, I saw, there were three pistol-belts, and three pairs of automatics.</p>
				<p>“Switchblade Joe Bonney, Jack-High Abe Bonney, Turkey-Buzzard Tom Bonney, together with your counsel, approach the court and hear the verdict,” Judge Nelson said.</p>
				<p>The three defendants and their lawyer rose. The Bonneys were swaggering and laughing, but for a lawyer whose clients had just emerged from the shadow of the gallows, Sidney was looking remarkably unhappy. He probably had imagination enough to see what would be waiting for him outside.</p>
				<p>“It pains me inexpressibly,” Judge Nelson said, “to inform you three that this court cannot convict you of the cowardly murder of that learned and honorable old man, Silas Cumshaw, nor can you be brought to trial in any other court on New Texas again for that dastardly crime. Here are your weapons, which must be returned to you. Sort them out yourselves, because I won’t dirty my fingers on them. And may you regret and feel shame for your despicable act as long as you live, which I hope won’t be more than a few hours.”</p>
				<p>With that, he used the end of his gavel to push the three belts off the bench and onto the floor at the Bonneys’ feet. They stood laughing at him for a few moments, then stopped, picked the belts up, drew the pistols to check magazines and chambers, and then began slapping each others’ backs and shouting jubilant congratulations at one another. Sidney’s two assistants and some of his friends came up and began pumping Sidney’s hands.</p>
				<p>“There!” Gail flung at me. “Now look at your masterpiece! Why don’t you go up and congratulate him, too?”</p>
				<p>And with that, she slapped me across the face. It hurt like the devil; she was a lot stronger than I’d expected.</p>
				<p>“In about two minutes,” I told her, “you can apologize to me for that, or weep over my corpse. Right now, though, you’d better be getting behind something solid.”</p>
			</section>
			<section id="lone-star-planet-11" epub:type="z3998:subchapter">
				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">XI</h3>
				<p>I turned and stepped forward to confront the Bonneys, mentally thanking Gail. Up until she’d slapped me, I’d been weak-kneed and dry-mouthed with what I had to do. Now I was just plain angry, and I found that I was thinking a lot more clearly. Jack-High Bonney’s wounded left shoulder, I knew, wouldn’t keep him from using his gun hand, but his shoulder muscles would be stiff enough to slow his draw. I’d intended saving him until I’d dealt with his brothers. Now, I remembered how he’d gotten that wound in the first place: he’d been the one who’d used the auto-rifle, out at the Hickock ranch. So I changed my plans and moved him up to top priority.</p>
				<p>“Hold it!” I yelled at them. “You’ve been cleared of killing a politician, but you still have killing a Solar League Ambassador to answer for. Now get your hands full of guns, if you don’t want to die with them empty!”</p>
				<p>The crowd of sympathizers and felicitators simply exploded away from the Bonney brothers. Out of the corner of my eye, I saw Sidney and a fat, blowsy woman with brass-colored hair as they both tried to dive under the friends-of-the-court table at the same place. The Bonney brothers simply stood and stared at me, for an instant, unbelievingly, as I got my thumbs on the release-studs of my belt. Judge Nelson’s gavel was hammering, and he was shouting:</p>
				<p>“Court⁠–⁠of⁠–⁠Political⁠–⁠Justice⁠–⁠Confederate⁠–⁠Continent⁠–⁠of⁠–⁠New⁠–⁠Texas⁠–⁠is⁠–⁠herewith⁠–⁠adjourned⁠–⁠reconvene⁠–⁠0900⁠–⁠tomorrow. <em>Hit the floor!</em>”</p>
				<p>“Damn! He means it!” Switchblade Joe Bonney exclaimed.</p>
				<p>Then they all reached for their guns. They were still reaching when I pressed the studs and the Krupp-Tattas popped up into my hands, and I swung up my right-hand gun and shot Jack-High through the head. After that, I just let my subconscious take over. I saw gun flames jump out at me from the Bonneys’ weapons, and I felt my own pistols leap and writhe in my hands, but I don’t believe I was aware of hearing the shots, not even from my own weapons. The whole thing probably lasted five seconds, but it seemed like twenty minutes to me. Then there was nobody shooting at me, and nobody for me to shoot at; the big room was silent, and I was aware that Judge Nelson and his eight associates were rising cautiously from behind the bench.</p>
				<p>I holstered my left-hand gun, removed and replaced the magazine of the right-hand gun, then holstered it and reloaded the other one. Hoddy Ringo and Francisco Parros and Commander Stonehenge were on their feet, their pistols drawn, covering the spectators’ seats. Colonel Hickock had also drawn a pistol and he was covering Sidney with it, occasionally moving the muzzle to the left to include the z’Srauff Ambassador and his two attachés.</p>
				<p>By this time, Nelson and the other eight judges were in their seats, trying to look calm and judicial.</p>
				<p>“Your Honor,” I said, “I fully realize that no judge likes to have his court turned into a shooting gallery. I can assure you, however, that my action here was not the result of any lack of respect for this court. It was pure necessity. Your Honor can see that: my government could not permit this crime against its Ambassador to pass unpunished.”</p>
				<p>Judge Nelson nodded solemnly. “Court was adjourned when this little incident happened, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk,” he said.</p>
				<p>He leaned forward and looked to where the three Bonney brothers were making a mess of blood on the floor. “I trust that nobody will construe my unofficial and personal comments here as establishing any legal precedent, and I wouldn’t like to see this sort of thing become customary⁠ ⁠… but⁠ ⁠… you did that all by yourself, with those little beanshooters.⁠ ⁠… Not bad, not bad at all, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Silk.”</p>
				<p>I thanked him, then turned to the z’Srauff Ambassador. I didn’t bother putting my remarks into Basic. He understood, as well as I did, what I was saying.</p>
				<p>“Look, Fido,” I told him, “my government is quite well aware of the source from which the orders for the murder of my predecessor came. These men I just killed were only the tools.</p>
				<p>“We’re going to get the brains behind them, if we have to send every warship we own into the z’Srauff star-cluster and devastate every planet in it. We don’t let dogs snap at us. And when they do, we don’t kick them, we shoot them!”</p>
				<p>That, of course, was not exactly striped-pants diplomatic language. I wondered, for a moment, what Norman Gazarian, the protocol man, would think if he heard an Ambassador calling another Ambassador Fido.</p>
				<p>But it seemed to be the kind of language that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Vuvuvu understood. He skinned back his upper lip at me and began snarling and growling. Then he turned on his hind paws and padded angrily down the aisle away from the front of the courtroom.</p>
				<p>The spectators around him and above him began barking, baying, yelping at him: “Tie a can to his tail!” “Git for home, Bruno!”</p>
				<p>Then somebody yelled, “Hey, look! Even his wrist watch is blushing!”</p>
				<p>That was perfectly true. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gglafrr Ddespttann Vuvuvu’s watch-face, normally white, was now glowing a bright ruby-red.</p>
				<p>I looked at Stonehenge and found him looking at me. It would be full dark in four or five hours; there ought to be something spectacular to see in the cloudless skies of Capella <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> tonight.</p>
				<p>Fleet Admiral Sir Rodney Tregaskis would see to that.</p>
				<hr/>
				<blockquote>

					<p>… so the measures considered by yourself and Secretary of State Ghopal Singh and Security Coordinator Natalenko, as transmitted to me by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hoddy Ringo, were not, I am glad to say, needed. Ambassador Silk, alive, handled the thing much better than Ambassador Silk, dead, could possibly have.</p>
					<p>… to confirm Sir Rodney Tregaskis’ report from the tales of the few survivors, the z’Srauff attack came as the Ambassador had expected. They dropped out of hyperspace about seventy light-minutes outside the Capella system, apparently in complete ignorance of the presence of our fleet.</p>

By a curious coincidence, the richest branch bank in the city was held up by a lone bandit about half an hour before he boarded the spaceship.⁠ ⁠…</p>

					<p>Please note that the guarantees of nonintervention in local political institutions are the very minimum which are acceptable to the people of New Texas.

				</blockquote>
				<p>Natalenko reread the addendum, pursed his thick lips and sighed. There were so many ways he could be using <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Stephen Silk.⁠ ⁠…</p>
				<p>For example⁠—he looked at the tri-di star-map, both usefully and beautifully decorating his walls⁠—over there, where Hoddy Ringo had gone, near Alderbaran <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>.</p>
				<p>Those were twin planets, one apparently settled by the equivalent descendants of the Edwards and the other inhabited by the children of a Jukes-Kallikak union.

				<p>Curious problem⁠ ⁠… and, how would Stephen Silk have handled it?</p>
				<p>The Security Coordinator scrawled a note comprehensible only to himself.⁠ ⁠…</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Ministry of Disturbance</h2>
			<p>The symphony was ending, the final triumphant paean soaring up and up, beyond the limit of audibility. For a moment, after the last notes had gone away, Paul sat motionless, as though some part of him had followed. Then he roused himself and finished his coffee and cigarette, looking out the wide window across the city below⁠—treetops and towers, roofs and domes and arching skyways, busy swarms of aircars glinting in the early sunlight. Not many people cared for João Coelho’s music, now, and least of all for the Eighth Symphony. It was the music of another time, a thousand years ago, when the Empire was blazing into being out of the long night and hammering back the Neobarbarians from world after world. Today people found it perturbing.</p>
			<p>He smiled faintly at the vacant chair opposite him, and lit another cigarette before putting the breakfast dishes on the serving-robot’s tray, and, after a while, realized that the robot was still beside his chair, waiting for dismissal. He gave it an instruction to summon the cleaning robots and sent it away. He could as easily have summoned them himself, or let the guards who would be in checking the room do it for him, but maybe it made a robot feel trusted and important to relay orders to other robots.</p>
			<p>Then he smiled again, this time in self-derision. A robot couldn’t feel important, or anything else. A robot was nothing but steel and plastic and magnetized tape and photo-micro-positronic circuits, whereas a man⁠—His Imperial Majesty Paul <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXII</span>, for instance⁠—was nothing but tissues and cells and colloids and electro-neuronic circuits. There was a difference; anybody knew that. The trouble was that he had never met anybody⁠—which included physicists, biologists, psychologists, psionicists, philosophers and theologians⁠—who could define the difference in satisfactorily exact terms. He watched the robot pivot on its treads and glide away, trailing steam from its coffee pot. It might be silly to treat robots like people, but that wasn’t as bad as treating people like robots, an attitude which was becoming entirely too prevalent. If only so many people didn’t act like robots!</p>
			<p>He crossed to the elevator and stood in front of it until a tiny electroencephalograph inside recognized his distinctive brainwave pattern. Across the room, another door was popping open in response to the robot’s distinctive wave pattern. He stepped inside and flipped a switch⁠—there were still a few things around that had to be manually operated⁠—and the door closed behind him and the elevator gave him an instant’s weightlessness as it started to drop forty floors.</p>
			<p>When it opened, Captain-General Dorflay of the Household Guard was waiting for him, with a captain and ten privates. General Dorflay was human. The captain and his ten soldiers weren’t. They wore helmets, emblazoned with the golden sun and superimposed black cogwheel of the Empire, and red kilts and black ankle boots and weapons belts, and the captain had a narrow gold-laced cape over his shoulders, but for the rest, their bodies were covered with a stiff mat of black hair, and their faces were slightly like terriers.’ (For all his humanity, Captain-General Dorflay’s face was more like a bulldog’s.) They were hillmen from the southern hemisphere of Thor, and as a people they made excellent mercenaries. They were crack shots, brave and crafty fighters, totally uninterested in politics off their own planet, and, because they had grown up in a patriarchial-clan society, they were fanatically loyal to anybody whom they accepted as their chieftain. Paul stepped out and gave them an inclusive nod.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Good morning, gentlemen.”</p>
			<p>“Good morning, Your Imperial Majesty,” General Dorflay said, bowing the couple of inches consistent with military dignity. The Thoran captain saluted by touching his forehead, his heart, which was on the right side, and the butt of his pistol. Paul complimented him on the smart appearance of his detail, and the captain asked how it could be otherwise, with the example and inspiration of his imperial majesty. Compliment and response could have been a playback from every morning of the ten years of his reign. So could Dorflay’s question: “Your Majesty will proceed to his study?”</p>
			<p>He wanted to say, “No, to Niffelheim with it; let’s get an aircar and fly a million miles somewhere,” and watch the look of shocked incomprehension on the captain-general’s face. He couldn’t do that, though; poor old Harv Dorflay might have a heart attack. He nodded slowly.</p>
			<p>“If you please, general.”</p>
			<p>Dorflay nodded to the Thoran captain, who nodded to his men. Four of them took two paces forward; the rest, unslinging weapons, went scurrying up the corridor, some posting themselves along the way and the rest continuing to the main hallway. The captain and two of his men started forward slowly; after they had gone twenty feet, Paul and General Dorflay fell in behind them, and the other two brought up the rear.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty,” Dorflay said, in a low voice, “let me beg you to be most cautious. I have just discovered that there exists a treasonous plot against your life.”</p>
			<p>Paul nodded. Dorflay was more than due to discover another treasonous plot; it had been ten days since the last one.</p>
			<p>“I believe you mentioned it, general. Something about planting loose strontium-90 in the upholstery of the Audience Throne, wasn’t it?”</p>
			<p>And before that, somebody had been trying to smuggle a fission bomb into the Palace in a wine cask, and before that, it was a booby trap in the elevator, and before that, somebody was planning to build a submachine gun into the viewscreen in the study, and⁠—</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, Your Majesty; that was⁠—Well, the persons involved in that plot became alarmed and fled the planet before I could arrest them. This is something different, Your Majesty. I have learned that unauthorized alterations have been made on one of the cooking-robots in your private kitchen, and I am positive that the object is to poison Your Majesty.”</p>
			<p>They were turning into the main hallway, between the rows of portraits of past emperors, Paul and Rodrik, Paul and Rodrik, alternating over and over on both walls. He felt a smile growing on his face, and banished it.</p>
			<p>“The robot for the meat sauces, wasn’t it?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Why⁠—! Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry, general. I should have warned you. Those alterations were made by roboticists from the Ministry of Security; they were installing an adaptation of a device used in the criminalistics-labs, to insure more uniform measurements. They’d done that already for Prince Travann, the Minister, and he’d recommended it to me.”</p>
			<p>That was a shame, spoiling poor Harv Dorflay’s murder plot. It had been such a nice little plot, too; he must have had a lot of fun inventing it. But a line had to be drawn somewhere. Let him turn the Palace upside down hunting for bombs; harass ladies-in-waiting whose lovers he suspected of being hired assassins; hound musicians into whose instruments he imagined firearms had been built; the emperor’s private kitchen would have to be off limits.</p>
			<p>Dorflay, who should have been looking crestfallen but relieved, stopped short⁠—shocking breach of Court etiquette⁠—and was staring in horror.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty! Prince Travann did that openly and with your consent? But, Your Majesty, I am convinced that it is Prince Travann himself who is the instigator of every one of these diabolical schemes. In the case of the elevator, I became suspicious of a man named Samml Ganner, one of Prince Travann’s secret police agents. In the case of the gun in the viewscreen, it was a technician whose sister is a member of the household of Countess Yirzy, Prince Travann’s mistress. In the case of the fission bomb⁠—”</p>
			<p>The two Thorans and their captain had kept on for some distance before they had discovered that they were no longer being followed, and were returning. He put his hand on General Dorflay’s shoulder and urged him forward.</p>
			<p>“Have you mentioned this to anybody?”</p>
			<p>“Not a word, Your Majesty. This Court is so full of treachery that I can trust no one, and we must never warn the villain that he is suspected⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Good. Say nothing to anybody.” They had reached the door of the study, now. “I think I’ll be here until noon. If I leave earlier, I’ll flash you a signal.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He entered the big oval room, lighted from overhead by the great star-map in the ceiling, and crossed to his desk, with the viewscreens and reading screens and communications screens around it, and as he sat down, he cursed angrily, first at Harv Dorflay and then, after a moment’s reflection, at himself. He was the one to blame; he’d known Dorflay’s paranoid condition for years. Have to do something about it. Any psycho-medic would certify him; be no problem at all to have him put away. But be blasted if he’d do that. That was no way to repay loyalty, even insane loyalty. Well, he’d find a way.</p>
			<p>He lit a cigarette and leaned back, looking up at the glowing swirl of billions of billions of tiny lights in the ceiling. At least, there were supposed to be billions of billions of them; he’d never counted them, and neither had any of the seventeen Rodriks and sixteen Pauls before him who had sat under them. His hand moved to a control button on his chair arm, and a red patch, roughly the shape of a pork chop, appeared on the western side.</p>
			<p>That was the Empire. Every one of the thousand three hundred and sixty-five inhabited worlds, a trillion and a half intelligent beings, fourteen races⁠—fifteen if you counted the Zarathustran Fuzzies, who were almost able to qualify under the talk-and-build-a-fire rule. And that had been the Empire when Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> had seen the map completed, and when Paul <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> had built the Palace, and when Stevan <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, the grandfather of Paul I, had proclaimed Odin the Imperial planet and Asgard the capital city. There had been some excuse for staying inside that patch of stars then; a newly won Empire must be consolidated within before it can safely be expanded. But that had been over eight centuries ago.</p>
			<p>He looked at the Daily Schedule, beautifully embossed and neatly slipped under his desk glass. Luncheon on the South Upper Terrace, with the Prime Minister and the Bench of Imperial Counselors. Yes, it was time for that again; that happened as inevitably and regularly as Harv Dorflay’s murder plots. And in the afternoon, a Plenary Session, Cabinet and Counselors. Was he going to have to endure the Bench of Counselors twice in the same day? Then the vexation was washed out of his face by a spreading grin. Bench of Counselors; that was the answer! Elevate Harv Dorflay to the Bench. That was what the Bench was for, a gold-plated dustbin for the disposal of superannuated dignitaries. He’d do no harm there, and a touch of outright lunacy might enliven and even improve the Bench.</p>
			<p>And in the evening, a banquet, and a reception and ball, in honor of His Majesty Ranulf <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, Planetary King of Durendal, and First Citizen Zhorzh Yaggo, People’s Manager-in-Chief of and for the Planetary Commonwealth of Aditya. Bargain day; two planetary chiefs of state in one big combination deal. He wondered what sort of prizes he had drawn this time, and closed his eyes, trying to remember. Durendal, of course, was one of the Sword-Worlds, settled by refugees from the losing side of the System States War in the time of the old Terran Federation, who had reappeared in Galactic history a few centuries later as the Space Vikings. They all had monarchial and rather picturesque governments; Durendal, he seemed to recall, was a sort of quasi-feudalism. About Aditya he was less sure. Something unpleasant, he thought; the titles of the government and its head were suggestive.</p>
			<p>He lit another cigarette and snapped on the reading screen to see what they had piled onto him this morning, and then swore when a graph chart, with jiggling red and blue and green lines, appeared. Chart day, too. Everything happens at once.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was the interstellar trade situation chart from Economics. Red line for production, green line for exports, blue for imports, sectioned vertically for the ten Viceroyalties and sub-sectioned for the Prefectures, and with the magnification and focus controls he could even get data for individual planets. He didn’t bother with that, and wondered why he bothered with the charts at all. The stuff was all at least twenty days behind date, and not uniformly so, which accounted for much of the jiggling. It had been transmitted from Planetary Proconsulate to Prefecture, and from Prefecture to Viceroyalty, and from there to Odin, all by ship. A ship on hyperdrive could log light-years an hour, but radio waves still had to travel 186,000 <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">m.p.s.</abbr> The supplementary chart for the past five centuries told the real story⁠—three perfectly level and perfectly parallel lines.</p>
			<p>It was the same on all the other charts. Population fluctuating slightly at the moment, completely static for the past five centuries. A slight decrease in agriculture, matched by an increase in synthetic food production. A slight population movement toward the more urban planets and the more densely populated centers. A trend downward in employment⁠—nonworking population increasing by about .0001 percent annually. Not that they were building better robots; they were just building them faster than they wore out. They all told the same story⁠—a stable economy, a static population, a peaceful and undisturbed Empire; eight centuries, five at least, of historyless tranquility. Well, that was what everybody wanted, wasn’t it?</p>
			<p>He flipped through the rest of the charts, and began getting summarized Ministry reports. Economics had denied a request from the Mining Cartel to authorize operations on a couple of uninhabited planets; danger of local market gluts and overstimulation of manufacturing. Permission granted to Robotics Cartel to⁠—Request from planetary government of Durendal for increase of cereal export quotas under consideration⁠—they wouldn’t want to turn that down while King Ranulf was here. Impulsively, he punched out a combination on the communication screen and got Count Duklass, Minister of Economics.</p>
			<p>Count Duklass had thinning red hair and a plump, agreeable, extrovert’s face. He smiled and waited to be addressed.</p>
			<p>“Sorry to bother Your Lordship,” Paul greeted him. “What’s the story on this export quota request from Durendal? We have their king here, now. Think he’s come to lobby for it?”</p>
			<p>Count Duklass chuckled. “He’s not doing anything about it, himself. Have you met him yet, sir?”</p>
			<p>“Not yet. He’s to be presented this evening.”</p>
			<p>“Well, when you see him⁠—I think the masculine pronoun is permissible⁠—you’ll see what I mean, sir. It’s this Lord Koreff, the Marshal. He came here on business, and had to bring the king along, for fear somebody else would grab him while he was gone. The whole object of Durendalian politics, as I understand, is to get possession of the person of the king. Koreff was on my screen for half an hour; I just got rid of him. Planet’s pretty heavily agricultural, they had a couple of very good crop years in a row, and now they have grain running out their ears, and they want to export it and cash in.”</p>
			<p>“Well?”</p>
			<p>“Can’t let them do it, Your Majesty. They’re not suffering any hardship; they’re just not making as much money as they think they ought to. If they start dumping their surplus into interstellar trade, they’ll cause all kinds of dislocations on other agricultural planets. At least, that’s what our computers all say.”</p>
			<p>And that, of course, was gospel. He nodded.</p>
			<p>“Why don’t they turn their surplus into whisky? Age it five or six years and it’d be on the luxury goods schedule and they could sell it anywhere.”</p>
			<p>Count Duklass’ eyes widened. “I never thought of that, Your Majesty. Just a microsec; I want to make a note of that. Pass it down to somebody who could deal with it. That’s a wonderful idea, Your Majesty!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He finally got the conversation to an end, and went back to the reports. Security, as usual, had a few items above the dead level of bureaucratic procedure. The planetary king of Excalibur had been assassinated by his brother and two nephews, all three of whom were now fighting among themselves. As nobody had anything to fight with except small arms and a few light cannon, there would be no intervention. There had been intervention on Behemoth, however, where a whole continent had tried to secede from the planetary republic and the Imperial Navy had been requested to send a task force. That was all right, in both cases. No interference with anything that passed for a planetary government, but only one sovereignty on any planet with nuclear weapons, and only one supreme sovereignty in a galaxy with hyperdrive ships.</p>
			<p>And there was rioting on Amaterasu, because of public indignation over a fraudulent election. He looked at that in incredulous delight. Why, here on Odin there hadn’t been an election in the past six centuries that hadn’t been utterly fraudulent. Nobody voted except the nonworkers, whose votes were bought and sold wholesale, by gangster bosses to pressure groups, and no decent person would be caught within a hundred yards of a polling place on an election day. He called the Minister of Security.</p>
			<p>Prince Travann was a man of his own age⁠—they had been classmates at the University⁠—but he looked older. His thin face was lined, and his hair was almost completely white. He was at his desk, with the Sun and Cogwheel of the Empire on the wall behind him, but on the breast of his black tunic he wore the badge of his family, a silver planet with three silver moons. Unlike Count Duklass, he didn’t wait to be spoken to.</p>
			<p>“Good morning, Your Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“Good morning, Your Highness; sorry to bother you. I just caught an interesting item in your report. This business on Amaterasu. What sort of a planet is it, politically? I don’t seem to recall.”</p>
			<p>“Why, they have a republican government, sir; a very complicated setup. Really, it’s a junk heap. When anything goes badly, they always build something new into the government, but they never abolish anything. They have a president, a premier, and an executive cabinet, and a tricameral legislature, and two complete and distinct judiciaries. The premier is always the presidential candidate getting the next highest number of votes. In the present instance, the president, who controls the planetary militia, is accusing the premier, who controls the police, of fraud in the election of the middle house of the legislature. Each is supported by the judiciary he controls. Practically every citizen belongs either to the militia or the police auxiliaries. I am looking forward to further reports from Amaterasu,” he added dryly.</p>
			<p>“I daresay they’ll be interesting. Send them to me in full, and red-star them, if you please, Prince Travann.”</p>
			<p>He went back to the reports. The Ministry of Science and Technology had sent up a lengthy one. The only trouble with it was that everything reported was duplication of work that had been done centuries before. Well, no. A <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dandrik, of the physics department of the Imperial University here in Asgard announced that a definite limit of accuracy in measuring the velocity of accelerated subnucleonic particles had been established⁠—16.067543333⁠—times light-speed. That seemed to be typical; the frontiers of science, now, were all decimal points. The Ministry of Education had a little to offer; historical scholarship was still active, at least. He was reading about a new trove of source-material that had come to light on Uller, from the Sixth Century Atomic Era, when the door screen buzzed and flashed.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He lit it, and his son Rodrik appeared in it, with Snooks, the little red hound, squirming excitedly in the Crown Prince’s arms. The dog began barking at once, and the boy called through the phone:</p>
			<p>“Good morning, father; are you busy?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, not at all.” He pressed the release button. “Come on in.”</p>
			<p>Immediately, the little hound leaped out of the princely arms and came dashing into the study and around the desk, jumping onto his lap. The boy followed more slowly, sitting down in the deskside chair and drawing his foot up under him. Paul greeted Snooks first⁠—people can wait, but for little dogs everything has to be right now⁠—and rummaged in a drawer until he found some wafers, holding one for Snooks to nibble. Then he became aware that his son was wearing leather shorts and tall buskins.</p>
			<p>“Going out somewhere?” he asked, a trifle enviously.</p>
			<p>“Up in the mountains, for a picnic. Olva’s going along.”</p>
			<p>And his tutor, and his esquire, and Olva’s companion-lady, and a dozen Thoran riflemen, of course, and they’d be in continuous screen-contact with the Palace.</p>
			<p>“That ought to be a lot of fun. Did you get all your lessons done?”</p>
			<p>“Physics and math and galactiography,” Rodrik told him. “And Professor Guilsan’s going to give me and Olva our history after lunch.”</p>
			<p>They talked about lessons, and about the picnic. Of course, Snooks was going on the picnic, too. It was evident, though, that Rodrik had something else on his mind. After a while, he came out with it.</p>
			<p>“Father, you know I’ve been a little afraid, lately,” he said.</p>
			<p>“Well, tell me about it, son. It isn’t anything about you and Olva, is it?”</p>
			<p>Rod was fourteen; the little Princess Olva thirteen. They would be marriageable in six years. As far as anybody could tell, they were both quite happy about the marriage which had been arranged for them years ago.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no; nothing like that. But Olva’s sister and a couple others of mother’s ladies-in-waiting were to a psi-medium, and the medium told them that there were going to be changes. Great and frightening changes was what she said.”</p>
			<p>“She didn’t specify?”</p>
			<p>“No. Just that: great and frightening changes. But the only change of that kind I can think of would be⁠ ⁠… well, something happening to you.”</p>
			<p>Snooks, having eaten three wafers, was trying to lick his ear. He pushed the little dog back into his lap and pummeled him gently with his left hand.</p>
			<p>“You mustn’t let mediums’ gabble worry you, son. These psi-mediums have real powers, but they can’t turn them off and on like a water tap. When they don’t get anything, they don’t like to admit it, and they invent things. Always generalities like that; never anything specific.”</p>
			<p>“I know all that.” The boy seemed offended, as though somebody were explaining that his mother hadn’t really found him out in the rose garden. “But they talked about it to some of their friends, and it seems that other mediums are saying the same thing. Father, do you remember when the Haval Valley reactor blew up? All over Odin, the mediums had been talking about a terrible accident, for a month before that happened.”</p>
			<p>“I remember that.” Harv Dorflay believed that somebody had been falsely informed that the emperor would visit the plant that day. “These great and frightening changes will probably turn out to be a new fad in abstract sculpture. Any change frightens most people.”</p>
			<p>They talked more about mediums, and then about aircars and aircar racing, and about the Emperor’s Cup race that was to be flown in a month. The communications screen began flashing and buzzing, and after he had silenced it with the busy-button for the third time, Rodrik said that it was time for him to go, came around to gather up Snooks, and went out, saying that he’d be home in time for the banquet. The screen began to flash again as he went out.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was Prince Ganzay, the Prime Minister. He looked as though he had a persistent low-level toothache, but that was his ordinary expression.</p>
			<p>“Sorry to bother Your Majesty. It’s about these chiefs-of-state. Count Gadvan, the Chamberlain, appealed to me, and I feel I should ask your advice. It’s the matter of precedence.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we have a fixed rule on that. Which one arrived first?”</p>
			<p>“Why, the Adityan, but it seems King Ranulf insists that he’s entitled to precedence, or, rather, his Lord Marshal does. This Lord Koreff insists that his king is not going to yield precedence to a commoner.”</p>
			<p>“Then he can go home to Durendal!” He felt himself growing angry⁠—all the little angers of the morning were focusing on one spot. He forced the harshness out of his voice. “At a court function, somebody has to go first, and our rule is order of arrival at the Palace. That rule was established to avoid violating the principle of equality to all civilized peoples and all planetary governments. We’re not going to set it aside for the King of Durendal, or anybody else.”</p>
			<p>Prince Ganzay nodded. Some of the toothache expression had gone out of his face, now that he had been relieved of the decision.</p>
			<p>“Of course, Your Majesty.” He brightened a little. “Do you think we might compromise? Alternate the precedence, I mean?”</p>
			<p>“Only if this First Citizen Yaggo consents. If he does, it would be a good idea.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll talk to him, sir.” The toothache expression came back. “Another thing, Your Majesty. They’ve both been invited to attend the Plenary Session, this afternoon.”</p>
			<p>“Well, no trouble there; they can enter by different doors and sit in visitors’ boxes at opposite ends of the hall.”</p>
			<p>“Well, sir, I wasn’t thinking of precedence. But this is to be an Elective Session⁠—new Ministers to replace Prince Havaly, of Defense, deceased, and Count Frask, of Science and Technology, elevated to the Bench. There seems to be some difference of opinion among some of the Ministers and Counselors. It’s very possible that the Session may degenerate into an outright controversy.”</p>
			<p>“Horrible,” Paul said seriously. “I think, though, that our distinguished guests will see that the Empire can survive difference of opinion, and even outright controversy. But if you think it might have a bad effect, why not postpone the election?”</p>
			<p>“Well⁠—It’s been postponed three times, already, sir.”</p>
			<p>“Postpone it permanently. Advertise for bids on two robot Ministers, Defense, and Science and Technology. If they’re a success, we can set up a project to design a robot emperor.”</p>
			<p>The Prime Minister’s face actually twitched and blanched at the blasphemy. “Your Majesty is joking,” he said, as though he wanted to be reassured on the point.</p>
			<p>“Unfortunately, I am. If my job could be robotized, maybe I could take my wife and my son and our little dog and go fishing for a while.”</p>
			<p>But, of course, he couldn’t. There were only two alternatives: the Empire or Galactic anarchy. The galaxy was too big to hold general elections, and there had to be a supreme ruler, and a positive and automatic⁠—which meant hereditary⁠—means of succession.</p>
			<p>“Whose opinion seems to differ from whose, and about what?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, Count Duklass and Count Tammsan want to have the Ministry of Science and Technology abolished, and its functions and personnel distributed. Count Duklass means to take over the technological sections under Economics, and Count Tammsan will take over the science part under Education. The proposal is going to be introduced at this Session by Count Guilfred, the Minister of Health and Sanity. He hopes to get some of the bio- and psycho-science sections for his own Ministry.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. Duklass gets the hide, Tammsan gets the head and horns, and everybody who hunts with them gets a cut of the meat. That’s good sound law of the chase. I’m not in favor of it, myself. Prince Ganzay, at this session, I wish you’d get Captain-General Dorflay nominated for the Bench. I feel that it is about time to honor him with elevation.”</p>
			<p>“General Dorflay? But why, Your Majesty?”</p>
			<p>“Great galaxy, do you have to ask? Why, because the man’s a raving lunatic. He oughtn’t even to be trusted with a sidearm, let alone five companies of armed soldiers. Do you know what he told me this morning?”</p>
			<p>“That somebody is training a Nidhog swamp-crawler to crawl up the Octagon Tower and bite you at breakfast, I suppose. But hasn’t that been going on for quite a while, sir?”</p>
			<p>“It was a gimmick in one of the cooking robots, but that’s aside from the question. He’s finally named the master mind behind all these nightmares of his, and who do you think it is? Yorn Travann!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Prime Minister’s face grew graver than usual. Well, it was something to look grave about; some of these days⁠—</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, I couldn’t possibly agree more about the general’s mental condition, but I really should say that, crazy or not, he is not alone in his suspicions of Prince Travann. If sharing them makes me a lunatic, too, so be it, but share them I do.”</p>
			<p>Paul felt his eyebrows lift in surprise. “That’s quite too much and too little, Prince Ganzay,” he said.</p>
			<p>“With your permission, I’ll elaborate. Don’t think that I suspect Prince Travann of any childish pranks with elevators or viewscreens or cooking-robots,” the Prime Minister hastened to disclaim, “but I definitely do suspect him of treasonous ambitions. I suppose Your Majesty knows that he is the first Minister of Security in centuries who has assumed personal control of both the planetary and municipal police, instead of delegating his ex officio powers.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty may not know, however, of some of the peculiar uses he has been making of those authorities. Does Your Majesty know that he has recruited the Security Guard up to at least ten times the strength needed to meet any conceivable peace-maintenance problem on this planet, and that he has been piling up huge quantities of heavy combat equipment⁠—guns up to 200-millimeter, heavy contragravity, even gun-cutters and bomb-and-rocket boats? And does Your Majesty know that most of this armament is massed within fifteen minutes’ flight-time of this Palace? Or that Prince Travann has at his disposal from two and a half to three times, in men and firepower, the combined strength of the Planetary Militia and the Imperial Army on this planet?”</p>
			<p>“I know. It has my approval. He’s trying to salvage some of the young nonworkers through exposing them to military discipline. A good many of them, I believe, have gone off-planet on their discharge from the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">S.G.</abbr> and hired as mercenaries, which is a far better profession than vote selling.”</p>
			<p>“Quite a plausible explanation: Prince Travann is nothing if not plausible,” the Prime Minister agreed. “And does Your Majesty know that, because of repeated demands for support from the Ministry of Security, the Imperial Navy has been scattered all over the Empire, and that there is not a naval craft bigger than a scout-boat within fifteen hundred light-years of Odin?”</p>
			<p>That was absolutely true. Paul could only nod agreement. Prince Ganzay continued:</p>
			<p>“He has been doing some peculiar things as Police Chief of Asgard, too. For instance, there are two powerful nonworkers’ voting-bloc bosses, Big Moogie Blisko and Zikko the Nose⁠—I assure Your Majesty that I am not inventing these names; that’s what the persons are actually called⁠—who have been enjoying the favor and support of Prince Travann. On a number of occasions, their smaller rivals, leaders of less important gangs, have been arrested, often on trumped-up charges, and held incommunicado until either Moogie or Zikko could move into their territories and annex their nonworker followers. These two bloc-bosses are subsidized, respectively, by the Steel and Shipbuilding Cartels and by the Reaction Products and Chemical Cartels, but actually, they are controlled by Prince Travann. They, in turn, control between them about seventy percent of the nonworkers in Asgard.”</p>
			<p>“And you think this adds up to a plot against the Throne?”</p>
			<p>“A plot to seize the Throne, Your Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, come, Prince Ganzay! You’re talking like Dorflay!”</p>
			<p>“Hear me out, Your Majesty. His Imperial Highness is fourteen years old; it will be eleven years before he will be legally able to assume the powers of emperor. In the dreadful event of your immediate death, it would mean a regency for that long. Of course, your Ministers and Counselors would be the ones to name the Regent, but I know how they would vote with Security Guard bayonets at their throats. And regency might not be the limit of Prince Travann’s ambitions.”</p>
			<p>“In your own words, quite plausible, Prince Ganzay. It rests, however, on a very questionable foundation. The assumption that Prince Travann is stupid enough to want the Throne.”</p>
			<p>He had to terminate the conversation himself and blank the screen. Viktor Ganzay was still staring at him in shocked incredulity when his image vanished. Viktor Ganzay could not imagine anybody not wanting the Throne, not even the man who had to sit on it.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He sat, for a while, looking at the darkened screen, a little worried. Viktor Ganzay had a much better intelligence service than he had believed. He wondered how much Ganzay had found out that he hadn’t mentioned. Then he went back to the reports. He had gotten down to the Ministry of Fine Arts when the communications screen began calling attention to itself again.</p>
			<p>When he flipped the switch, a woman smiled out of it at him. Her blond hair was rumpled, and she wore a dressing gown; her smile brightened as his face appeared in her screen.</p>
			<p>“Hi!” she greeted him.</p>
			<p>“Hi, yourself. You just get up?”</p>
			<p>She raised a hand to cover a yawn. “I’ll bet you’ve been up reigning for hours. Were Rod and Snooks in to see you yet?”</p>
			<p>He nodded. “They just left. Rod’s going on a picnic with Olva in the mountains.” How long had it been since he and Marris had been on a picnic⁠—a real picnic, with less than fifty guards and as many courtiers along? “Do you have much reigning to do, this afternoon?”</p>
			<p>She grimaced. “Flower Festivals. I have to make personal tri-di appearances, live, with messages for the loving subjects. Three minutes on, and a two-minute break between. I have forty for this afternoon.”</p>
			<p>“Ugh! Well, have a good time, sweetheart. All I have is lunch with the Bench, and then this Plenary Session.” He told her about Ganzay’s fear of outright controversy.</p>
			<p>“Oh, fun! Maybe somebody’ll pull somebody’s whiskers, or something. I’m in on that, too.”</p>
			<p>The call-indicator in front of him began glowing with the code-symbol of the Minister of Security.</p>
			<p>“We can always hope, can’t we? Well, Yorn Travann’s trying to get me, now.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t keep him waiting. Maybe I can see you before the Session.” She made a kissing motion with her lips at him, and blanked the screen.</p>
			<p>He flipped the switch again, and Prince Travann was on the screen. The Security Minister didn’t waste time being sorry to bother him.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, a report’s just come in that there’s a serious riot at the University; between five and ten thousand students are attacking the Administration Center, lobbing stench bombs into it, and threatening to hang Chancellor Khane. They have already overwhelmed and disarmed the campus police, and I’ve sent two companies of the Gendarme riot brigade, under an officer I can trust to handle things firmly but intelligently. We don’t want any indiscriminate stunning or tear-gassing or shooting; all sorts of people can have sons and daughters mixed up in a student riot.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. I seem to recall student riots in which the sons of his late Highness Prince Travann and his late Majesty Rodrik <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXI</span> were involved.” He deliberated the point for a moment, and added: “This scarcely sounds like a frat-fight or a panty-raid, though. What seems to have triggered it?”</p>
			<p>“The story I got⁠—a rather hysterical call for help from Khane himself⁠—is that they’re protesting an action of his in dismissing a faculty member. I have a couple of undercovers at the University, and I’m trying to contact them. I sent more undercovers, who could pass for students, ahead of the Gendarmes to get the student side of it and the names of the ringleaders.” He glanced down at the indicator in front of him, which had begun to glow. “If you’ll pardon me, sir, Count Tammsan’s trying to get me. He may have particulars. I’ll call Your Majesty back when I learn anything more.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There hadn’t been anything like that at the University within the memory of the oldest old grad. Chancellor Khane, he knew, was a stupid and arrogant old windbag with a swollen sense of his own importance. He made a small bet with himself that the whole thing was Khane’s fault, but he wondered what lay behind it, and what would come out of it. Great plagues from little microbes start. Great and frightening changes⁠—</p>
			<p>The screen got itself into an uproar, and he flipped the switch. It was Viktor Ganzay again. He looked as though his permanent toothache had deserted him for the moment.</p>
			<p>“Sorry to bother Your Majesty, but it’s all fixed up,” he reported. “First Citizen Yaggo agreed to alternate in precedence with King Ranulf, and Lord Koreff has withdrawn all his objections. As far as I can see, at present, there should be no trouble.”</p>
			<p>“Fine. I suppose you heard about the excitement at the University?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, Your Majesty. Disgraceful affair!”</p>
			<p>“Simply shocking. What seems to have started it, have you heard?” he asked. “All I know is that the students were protesting the dismissal of a faculty member. He must have been exceptionally popular, or else he got a more than ordinary raw deal from Khane.”</p>
			<p>“Well, as to that, sir, I can’t say. All I learned was that it was the result of some faculty squabble in one of the science departments; the grounds for the dismissal were insubordination and contempt for authority.”</p>
			<p>“I always thought that when authority began inspiring contempt, it had stopped being authority. Did you say science? This isn’t going to help Duklass and Tammsan any.”</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid not, Your Majesty.” Ganzay didn’t look particularly regretful. “The News Cartel’s gotten hold of it and are using it; it’ll be all over the Empire.”</p>
			<p>He said that as though it meant something. Well, maybe it did; a lot of Ministers and almost all the Counselors spent most of their time worrying about what people on planets like Chermosh and Zarathustra and Deirdre and Quetzalcoatl might think, in ignorance of the fact that interest in Empire politics varied inversely as the square of the distance to Odin and the level of corruption and inefficiency of the local government.</p>
			<p>“I notice you’ll be at the Bench luncheon. Do you think you could invite our guests, too? We could have an informal presentation before it starts. Can do? Good. I’ll be seeing you there.”</p>
			<p>When the screen was blanked, he returned to the reports, ran them off hastily to make sure that nothing had been red-starred, and called a robot to clear the projector. After a while, Prince Travann called again.</p>
			<p>“Sorry to bother Your Majesty, but I have most of the facts on the riot, now. What happened was that Chancellor Khane sacked a professor, physics department, under circumstances which aroused resentment among the science students. Some of them walked out of class and went to the stadium to hold a protest meeting, and the thing snowballed until half the students were in it. Khane lost his head and ordered the campus police to clear the stadium; the students rushed them and swamped them. I hope, for their sakes, that none of my men ever let anything like that happen. The man I sent, a Colonel Handrosan, managed to talk the students into going back to the stadium and continuing the meeting under Gendarme protection.”</p>
			<p>“Sounds like a good man.”</p>
			<p>“Very good, Your Majesty. Especially in handling disturbances. I have complete confidence in him. He’s also investigating the background of the affair. I’ll give Your Majesty what he’s learned, to date. It seems that the head of the physics department, a Professor Nelse Dandrik, had been conducting an experiment, assisted by a Professor Klenn Faress, to establish more accurately the velocity of subnucleonic particles, beta micropositos, I believe. Dandrik’s story, as relayed to Handrosan by Khane, is that he reached a limit and the apparatus began giving erratic results.”</p>
			<p>Prince Travann stopped to light a cigarette. “At this point, Professor Dandrik ordered the experiment stopped, and Professor Faress insisted on continuing. When Dandrik ordered the apparatus dismantled, Faress became rather emotional about it⁠—obscenely abusive and threatening, according to Dandrik. Dandrik complained to Khane, Khane ordered Faress to apologize, Faress refused, and Khane dismissed Faress. Immediately, the students went on strike. Faress confirmed the whole story, and he added one small detail that Dandrik hadn’t seen fit to mention. According to him, when these micropositos were accelerated beyond sixteen and a fraction times light-speed, they began registering at the target before the source registered the emission.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I⁠—<em>What did you say</em>?”</p>
			<p>Prince Travann repeated it slowly, distinctly and tonelessly.</p>
			<p>“That was what I thought you said. Well, I’m going to insist on a complete investigation, including a repetition of the experiment. Under direction of Professor Faress.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Your Majesty. And when that happens, I mean to be on hand personally. If somebody is just before discovering time-travel, I think Security has a very substantial interest in it.”</p>
			<p>The Prime Minister called back to confirm that First Citizen Yaggo and King Ranulf would be at the luncheon. The Chamberlain, Count Gadvan, called with a long and dreary problem about the protocol for the banquet. Finally, at noon, he flashed a signal for General Dorflay, waited five minutes, and then left his desk and went out, to find the mad general and his wirehaired soldiers drawn up in the hall.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were more Thorans on the South Upper Terrace, and after a flurry of porting and presenting and ordering arms and hand-saluting, the Prime Minister advanced and escorted him to where the Bench of Counselors, all thirty of them, total age close to twenty-eight hundred years, were drawn up in a rough crescent behind the three distinguished guests. The King of Durendal wore a cloth-of-silver leotard and pink tights, and a belt of gold links on which he carried a jeweled dagger only slightly thicker than a knitting needle. He was slender and willowy, and he had large and soulful eyes, and the royal beautician must have worked on him for a couple of hours. Wait till Marris sees this; oh, brother!</p>
			<p>Koreff, the Lord Marshal, wore what was probably the standard costume of Durendal, a fairly long jerkin with short sleeves, and knee-boots, and his dress dagger looked as though it had been designed for use. Lord Koreff looked as though he would be quite willing and able to use it; he was fleshy and full-faced, with hard muscles under the flesh.</p>
			<p>First Citizen Yaggo, People’s Manager-in-Chief of and for the Planetary Commonwealth of Aditya, wore a one-piece white garment like a mechanic’s coveralls, with the emblem of his government and the numeral 1 on his breast. He carried no dagger; if he had worn a dress weapon, it would probably have been a slide rule. His head was completely shaven, and he had small, pale eyes and a rattrap mouth. He was regarding the Durendalians with a distaste that was all too evidently reciprocated.</p>
			<p>King Ranulf appeared to have won the toss for first presentation. He squeezed the Imperial hand in both of his and looked up adoringly as he professed his deep honor and pleasure. Yaggo merely clasped both his hands in front of the emblem on his chest and raised them quickly to the level of his chin, saying: “At the service of the Imperial State,” and adding, as though it hurt him, “Your Imperial Majesty.” Not being a chief of state, Lord Koreff came third; he merely shook hands and said, “A great honor, Your Imperial Majesty, and the thanks, both of myself and my royal master, for a most gracious reception.” The attempt to grab first place having failed, he was more than willing to forget the whole subject. There was a chance that finding a way to dispose of the grain surplus might make the difference between his staying in power at home or not.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, the three guests had already met the Bench of Counselors. Immediately after the presentation of Lord Koreff, they all started the two hundred yards march to the luncheon pavilion, the King of Durendal clinging to his left arm and First Citizen Yaggo stumping dourly on his right, with Prince Ganzay beyond him and Lord Koreff on Ranulf’s left.</p>
			<p>“Do you plan to stay long on Odin?” he asked the king.</p>
			<p>“Oh. I’d <em>love</em> to stay for simply <em>months</em>! Everything is so <em>wonderful</em>, here in Asgard; it makes our little capital of Roncevaux seem so <em>utterly</em> provincial. I’m going to tell Your Imperial Majesty a secret. I’m going to see if I can lure some of your <em>wonderful</em> ballet dancers back to Durendal with me. Aren’t I <em>naughty</em>, raiding Your Imperial Majesty’s theaters?”</p>
			<p>“In keeping with the traditions of your people,” he replied gravely. “You Sword-Worlders used to raid everywhere you went.”</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid those bad old days are long past, Your Imperial Majesty,” Lord Koreff said. “But we Sword-Worlders got around the galaxy, for a while. In fact, I seem to remember reading that some of our brethren from Morglay or Flamberge even occupied Aditya for a couple of centuries. Not that you’d guess it to look at Aditya now.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was First Citizen Yaggo’s turn to take precedence⁠—the seat on the right of the throne chair. Lord Koreff sat on Ranulf’s left, and, to balance him, Prince Ganzay sat beyond Yaggo and dutifully began inquiring of the People’s Manager-in-Chief about the structure of his government, launching him on a monologue that promised to last at least half the luncheon. That left the King of Durendal to Paul; for a start, he dropped a compliment on the cloth-of-silver leotard.</p>
			<p>King Ranulf laughed dulcetly, brushed the garment with his fingertips, and said that it was just a simple thing patterned after the Durendalian peasant costume.</p>
			<p>“You have peasants on Durendal?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, <em>dear</em>, yes! Such quaint, <em>charming</em> people. Of course, they’re all poor, and they wear such <em>funny</em> ragged clothes, and travel about in rackety old aircars, it’s a wonder they don’t fall apart in the air. But they’re so <em>wonderfully</em> happy and carefree. I often wish I were one of them, instead of king.”</p>
			<p>“Nonworking class, Your Imperial Majesty,” Lord Koreff explained.</p>
			<p>“On Aditya,” First Citizen Yaggo declared, “there are no classes, and on Aditya everybody works. ‘From each according to his ability; to each according to his need.’ ”</p>
			<p>“On Aditya,” an elderly Counselor four places to the right of him said loudly to his neighbor, “they don’t call them classes, they call them sociological categories, and they have nineteen of them. And on Aditya, they don’t call them nonworkers, they call them occupational reservists, and they have more of them than we do.”</p>
			<p>“But of course, I was born a king,” Ranulf said sadly and nobly. “I have a duty to my people.”</p>
			<p>“No, they don’t vote at all,” Lord Koreff was telling the Counselor on his left. “On Durendal, you have to pay taxes before you can vote.”</p>
			<p>“On Aditya the crime of taxation does not exist,” the First Citizen told the Prime Minister.</p>
			<p>“On Aditya,” the Counselor four places down said to his neighbor, “there’s nothing to tax. The state owns all the property, and if the Imperial Constitution and the Space Navy let them, the State would own all the people, too. Don’t tell me about Aditya. First big-ship command I had was the old <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Invictus</i>, 374, and she was based on Aditya for four years, and I’d sooner have spent that time in orbit around Niffelheim.”</p>
			<p>Now Paul remembered who he was; old Admiral⁠—now Prince-Counselor⁠—Gaklar. He and Prince-Counselor Dorflay would get along famously. The Lord Marshal of Durendal was replying to some objection somebody had made:</p>
			<p>“No, nothing of the sort. We hold the view that every civil or political right implies a civil or political obligation. The citizen has a right to protection from the Realm, for instance; he therefore has the obligation to defend the Realm. And his right to participate in the government of the Realm includes his obligation to support the Realm financially. Well, we tax only property; if a nonworker acquires taxable property, he has to go to work to earn the taxes. I might add that our nonworkers are very careful to avoid acquiring taxable property.”</p>
			<p>“But if they don’t have votes to sell, what do they live on?” a Counselor asked in bewilderment.</p>
			<p>“The nobility supports them; the landowners, the trading barons, the industrial lords. The more nonworking adherents they have, the greater their prestige.” And the more rifles they could muster when they quarreled with their fellow nobles, of course. “Beside, if we didn’t do that, they’d turn brigand, and it costs less to support them than to have to hunt them out of the brush and hang them.”</p>
			<p>“On Aditya, brigandage does not exist.”</p>
			<p>“On Aditya, all the brigands belong to the Secret Police, only on Aditya they don’t call them Secret Police, they call them Servants of the People, Ninth Category.”</p>
			<p>A shadow passed quickly over the pavilion, and then another. He glanced up quickly, to see two long black troop carriers, emblazoned with the Sun and Cogwheel and armored fist of Security, pass back of the Octagon Tower and let down on the north landing stage. A third followed. He rose quickly.</p>
			<p>“Please remain seated, gentlemen, and continue with the luncheon. If you will excuse me for a moment, I’ll be back directly.” I hope, he added mentally.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Captain-General Dorflay, surrounded by a dozen officers, Thoran and human, had arrived on the lower terrace at the base of the Octagon Tower. They had a full Thoran rifle company with them. As he went down to them, Dorflay hurried forward.</p>
			<p>“It has come, Your Majesty!” he said, as soon as he could make himself heard without raising his voice. “We are all ready to die with Your Majesty!”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I doubt it’ll come quite to that, Harv,” he said. “But just to be on the safe side, take that company and the gentlemen who are with you and get up to the mountains and join the Crown Prince and his party. Here.” He took a notepad from his belt pouch and wrote rapidly, sealing the note and giving it to Dorflay. “Give this to His Highness, and place yourself under his orders. I know; he’s just a boy, but he has a good head. Obey him exactly in everything, but under no circumstances return to the Palace or allow him to return until I call you.”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty is ordering me away?” The old soldier was aghast.</p>
			<p>“An emperor who has a son can be spared. An emperor’s son who is too young to marry can’t. You know that.”</p>
			<p>Harv Dorflay was only mad on one subject, and even within the frame of his madness he was intensely logical. He nodded. “Yes, Your Imperial Majesty. We both serve the Empire as best we can. And I will guard the little Princess Olva, too.” He grasped Paul’s hand, said, “Farewell, Your Majesty!” and dashed away, gathering his staff and the company of Thorans as he went. In an instant, they had vanished down the nearest rampway.</p>
			<p>The emperor watched their departure, and, at the same time, saw a big black aircar, bearing the three-mooned planet, argent on sable, of Travann, let down onto the south landing stage, and another troop carrier let down after it. Four men left the aircar⁠—Yorn, Prince Travann, and three officers in the black of the Security Guard. Prince Ganzay had also left the table: he came from one direction as Prince Travann advanced from the other. They converged on the emperor.</p>
			<p>“What’s happening here, Prince Travann?” Prince Ganzay demanded. “Why are you bringing all these troops to the Palace?”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty,” Prince Travann said smoothly, “I trust that you will pardon this disturbance. I’m sure nothing serious will happen, but I didn’t dare take chances. The students from the University are marching on the Palace⁠—perfectly peaceful and loyal procession; they’re bringing a petition for Your Majesty⁠—but on the way, while passing through a nonworkers’ district, they were attacked by a gang of hooligans connected with a voting-bloc boss called Nutchy the Knife. None of the students were hurt, and Colonel Handrosan got the procession out of the district promptly, and then dropped some of his men, who have since been reinforced, to deal with the hooligans. That’s still going on, and these riots are like forest fires; you never know when they’ll shift and get out of control. I hope the men I brought won’t be needed here. Really, they’re a reserve for the riot work; I won’t commit them, though, until I’m sure the Palace is safe.”</p>
			<p>He nodded. “Prince Travann, how soon do you estimate that the student procession will arrive here?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“They’re coming on foot, Your Majesty. I’d give them an hour, at least.”</p>
			<p>“Well, Prince Travann, will you have one of your officers see that the public-address screen in front is ready; I’ll want to talk to them when they arrive. And meanwhile, I’ll want to talk to Chancellor Khane, Professor Dandrik, Professor Faress and Colonel Handrosan, together. And Count Tammsan, too; Prince Ganzay, will you please screen him and invite him here immediately?”</p>
			<p>“Now, Your Majesty?” At first, the Prime Minister was trying to suppress a look of incredulity; then he was trying to keep from showing comprehension. “Yes, Your Majesty; at once.” He frowned slightly when he saw two of the Security Guard officers salute Prince Travann instead of the emperor before going away. Then he turned and hurried toward the Octagon Tower.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The officer who had gone to the aircar to use the radio returned and reported that Colonel Handrosan was bringing the Chancellor and both professors from the University in his command-car, having anticipated that they would be wanted. Paul nodded in pleasure.</p>
			<p>“You have a good man there, Prince,” he said. “Keep an eye on him.”</p>
			<p>“I know it, Your Majesty. To tell the truth, it was he who organized this march. Thought they’d be better employed coming here to petition you than milling around the University getting into further mischief.”</p>
			<p>The other officer also returned, bringing a portable viewscreen with him on a contragravity-lifter. By this time, the Bench of Counselors and the three off-planet guests had become anxious and left the luncheon pavilion in a body. The Counselors were looking about uneasily, noticing the black uniformed Security Guards who had left the troop carrier and were taking position by squads all around the emperor. First Citizen Yaggo, and King Ranulf and Lord Koreff, also seemed uneasy. They were avoiding the proximity of Paul as though he had the green death.</p>
			<p>The viewscreen came on, and in it the city, as seen from an aircar at two thousand feet, spread out with the Palace visible in the distance, the golden pile of the Octagon Tower jutting up from it. The car carrying the pickup was behind the procession, which was moving toward the Palace along one of the broad skyways, with Gendarmes and Security Guards leading, following and flanking. There were a few Imperial and planetary and school flags, but none of the quantity-made banners and placards which always betray a planned demonstration.</p>
			<p>Prince Ganzay had been gone for some time, now. When he returned, he drew Paul aside.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty,” he whispered softly, “I tried to summon Army troops, but it’ll be hours before any can get here. And the Militia can’t be mobilized in anything less than a day. There are only five thousand Army Regulars on Odin, now, anyhow.”</p>
			<p>And half of them officers and noncoms of skeleton regiments. Like the Navy, the Army had been scattered all over the Empire⁠—on Behemoth and Amida and Xipetotec and Astarte and Jotunnheim⁠—in response to calls for support from Security.</p>
			<p>“Let’s have a look at this rioting, Prince Travann,” one of the less decrepit Counselors, a retired general, said. “I want to see how your people are handling it.”</p>
			<p>The officers who had come with Prince Travann consulted briefly, and then got another pickup on the screen. This must have been a regular public pickup, on the front of a tall building. It was a couple of miles farther away; the Palace was visible only as a tiny glint from the Octagon Tower, on the skyline. Half a dozen Security aircars were darting about, two of them chasing a battered civilian vehicle and firing at it. On rooftops and terraces and skyways, little clumps of Security Guards were skirmishing, dodging from cover to cover, and sometimes individuals or groups in civilian clothes fired back at them. There was a surprising absence of casualties.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty!” the old general hissed in a scandalized whisper. “That’s nothing but a big fake! Look, they’re all firing blanks! The rifles hardly kick at all, and there’s too much smoke for propellant-powder.”</p>
			<p>“I noticed that.” This riot must have been carefully prepared, long in advance. Yet the student riot seemed to have been entirely spontaneous. That puzzled him; he wished he knew just what Yorn Travann was up to. “Just keep quiet about it,” he advised.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>More aircars were arriving, big and luxurious, emblazoned with the arms of some of the most distinguished families in Asgard. One of the first to let down bore the device of Duklass, and from it the Minister of Economics, the Minister of Education, and a couple of other Ministers, alighted. Count Duklass went at once to Prince Travann, drawing him away from King Ranulf and Lord Koreff and talking to him rapidly and earnestly. Count Tammsan approached at a swift half-run.</p>
			<p>“Save Your Majesty!” he greeted, breathlessly. “What’s going on, sir? We heard something about some petty brawl at the University, that Prince Ganzay had become alarmed about, but now there seems to be fighting all over the city. I never saw anything like it; on the way here we had to go up to ten thousand feet to get over a battle, and there’s a vast crowd on the Avenue of the Arts, and⁠—” He took in the Security Guards. “Your Majesty, just what <em>is</em> going on?”</p>
			<p>“Great and frightening changes.” Count Tammsan started; he must have been to a psi-medium, too. “But I think the Empire is going to survive them. There may even be a few improvements, before things are done.”</p>
			<p>A blue-uniformed Gendarme officer approached Prince Travann, drawing him away from Count Duklass and speaking briefly to him. The Minister of Security nodded, then turned back to the Minister of Economics. They talked for a few moments longer, then clasped hands, and Travann left Duklass with his face wreathed in smiles. The Gendarme officer accompanied him as he approached.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, this is Colonel Handrosan, the officer who handled the affair at the University.”</p>
			<p>“And a very good piece of work, colonel.” He shook hands with him. “Don’t be surprised if it’s remembered next Honors Day. Did you bring Khane and the two professors?”</p>
			<p>“They’re down on the lower landing-stage, Your Majesty. We’re delaying the students, to give Your Majesty time to talk to them.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll see them now. My study will do.” The officer saluted and went away. He turned to Count Tammsan. “That’s why I asked Prince Ganzay to invite you here. This thing’s become too public to be ignored; some sort of action will have to be taken. I’m going to talk to the students; I want to find out just what happened before I commit myself to anything. Well, gentlemen, let’s go to my study.”</p>
			<p>Count Tammsan looked around, bewildered. “But I don’t understand⁠—” He fell into step with Paul and the Minister of Security; a squad of Security Guards fell in behind them. “I don’t understand what’s happening,” he complained.</p>
			<p>An emperor about to have his throne yanked out from under him, and a minister about to stage a coup d’etat, taking time out to settle a trifling academic squabble. One thing he did understand, though, was that the Ministry of Education was getting some very bad publicity at a time when it could be least afforded. Prince Travann was telling him about the hooligans’ attack on the marching students, and that worried him even more. Nonworking hooligans acted as voting-bloc bosses ordered; voting-bloc bosses acted on orders from the political manipulators of Cartels and pressure-groups, and action downward through the nonworkers was usually accompanied by action upward through influences to which ministers were sensitive.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were a dozen Security Guards in black tunics, and as many Household Thorans in red kilts, in the hall outside the study, fraternizing amicably. They hurried apart and formed two ranks, and the Thoran officer with them saluted.</p>
			<p>Going into the study, he went to his desk; Count Tammsan lit a cigarette and puffed nervously, and sat down as though he were afraid the chair would collapse under him. Prince Travann sank into another chair and relaxed, closing his eyes. There was a bit of wafer on the floor by Paul’s chair, dropped by the little dog that morning. He stooped and picked it up, laying it on his desk, and sat looking at it until the door screen flashed and buzzed. Then he pressed the release button.</p>
			<p>Colonel Handrosan ushered the three University men in ahead of him⁠—Khane, with a florid, arrogant face that showed worry under the arrogance; Dandrik, gray-haired and stoop-shouldered, looking irritated; Faress, young, with a scrubby red mustache, looking bellicose. He greeted them collectively and invited them to sit, and there was a brief uncomfortable silence which everybody expected him to break.</p>
			<p>“Well, gentlemen,” he said, “we want to get the facts about this affair in some kind of order. I wish you’d tell me, as briefly and as completely as possible, what you know about it.”</p>
			<p>“There’s the man who started it!” Khane declared, pointing at Faress.</p>
			<p>“Professor Faress had nothing to do with it,” Colonel Handrosan stated flatly. “He and his wife were in their apartment, packing to move out, when it started. Somebody called him and told him about the fighting at the stadium, and he went there at once to talk his students into dispersing. By that time, the situation was completely out of hand; he could do nothing with the students.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I think we ought to find out, first of all, why Professor Faress was dismissed,” Prince Travann said. “It will take a good deal to convince me that any teacher able to inspire such loyalty in his students is a bad teacher, or deserves dismissal.”</p>
			<p>“As I understand,” Paul said, “the dismissal was the result of a disagreement between Professor Faress and Professor Dandrik about an experiment on which they were working. I believe, an experiment to fix more exactly the velocity of accelerated subnucleonic particles. Beta micropositos, wasn’t it, Chancellor Khane?”</p>
			<p>Khane looked at him in surprise. “Your Majesty, I know nothing about that. Professor Dandrik is head of the physics department; he came to me, about six months ago, and told me that in his opinion this experiment was desirable. I simply deferred to his judgment and authorized it.”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty has just stated the purpose of the experiment,” Dandrik said. “For centuries, there have been inaccuracies in mathematical descriptions of subnucleonic events, and this experiment was undertaken in the hope of eliminating these inaccuracies.” He went into a lengthy mathematical explanation.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I understand that, professor. But just what was the actual experiment, in terms of physical operations?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Dandrik looked helpless for a moment. Faress, who had been choking back a laugh, interrupted:</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, we were using the big turbo-linear accelerator to project fast micropositos down an evacuated tube one kilometer in length, and clocking them with light, the velocity of which has been established almost absolutely. I will say that with respect to the light, there were no observable inaccuracies at any time, and until the micropositos were accelerated to 16.067543333⅓ times light-speed, they registered much as expected. Beyond that velocity, however, the target for the micropositos began registering impacts before the source registered emission, although the light target was still registering normally. I notified Professor Dandrik about this, and⁠—”</p>
			<p>“You notified him. Wasn’t he present at the time?”</p>
			<p>“No, Your Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, I am head of the physics department of the University. I have too much administrative work to waste time on the technical aspects of experiments like this,” Dandrik interjected.</p>
			<p>“I understand. Professor Faress was actually performing the experiment. You told Professor Dandrik what had happened. What then?”</p>
			<p>“Why, Your Majesty, he simply declared that the limit of accuracy had been reached, and ordered the experiment dropped. He then reported the highest reading before this anticipation effect was observed as the newly established limit of accuracy in measuring the velocity of accelerated micropositos, and said nothing whatever in his report about the anticipation effect.”</p>
			<p>“I read a summary of the report. Why, Professor Dandrik, did you omit mentioning this slightly unusual effect?”</p>
			<p>“Why, because the whole thing was utterly preposterous, that’s why!” Dandrik barked; and then hastily added, “Your Imperial Majesty.” He turned and glared at Faress; professors do not glare at galactic emperors. “Your Majesty, the limit of accuracy had been reached. After that, it was only to be expected that the apparatus would give erratic reports.”</p>
			<p>“It might have been expected that the apparatus would stop registering increased velocity relative to the light-speed standard, or that it would begin registering disproportionately,” Faress said. “But, Your Majesty, I’ll submit that it was not to be expected that it would register impacts before emissions. And I’ll add this. After registering this slight apparent jump into the future, there was no proportionate increase in anticipation with further increase of acceleration. I wanted to find out why. But when Professor Dandrik saw what was happening, he became almost hysterical, and ordered the accelerator shut down as though he were afraid it would blow up in his face.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“I think it has blown up in his face,” Prince Travann said quietly. “Professor, have you any theory, or supposition, or even any wild guess, as to how this anticipation effect occurs?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Your Highness. I suspect that the apparent anticipation is simply an observational illusion, similar to the illusion of time-reversal experienced when it was first observed, though not realized, that positrons sometimes exceeded light-speed.”</p>
			<p>“Why, that’s what I’ve been saying all along!” Dandrik broke in. “The whole thing is an illusion, due⁠—”</p>
			<p>“To having reached the limit of observational accuracy; I understand, Professor Dandrik. Go on, Professor Faress.”</p>
			<p>“I think that beyond 16.067543333⅓ times light-speed, the micropositos ceased to have any velocity at all, velocity being defined as rate of motion in four-dimensional space-time. I believe they moved through the three spatial dimensions without moving at all in the fourth, temporal, dimension. They made that kilometer from source to target, literally, in nothing flat. Instantaneity.”</p>
			<p>That must have been the first time he had actually come out and said it. Dandrik jumped to his feet with a cry that was just short of being a shriek.</p>
			<p>“He’s crazy! Your Majesty, you mustn’t⁠ ⁠… that is, well, I mean⁠—Please, Your Majesty, don’t listen to him. He doesn’t know what he’s saying. He’s raving!”</p>
			<p>“He knows perfectly well what he’s saying, and it probably scares him more than it does you. The difference is that he’s willing to face it and you aren’t.”</p>
			<p>The difference was that Faress was a scientist and Dandrik was a science teacher. To Faress, a new door had opened, the first new door in eight hundred years. To Dandrik, it threatened invalidation of everything he had taught since the morning he had opened his first class. He could no longer say to his pupils, “You are here to learn from me.” He would have to say, more humbly, “<em>We</em> are here to learn from the Universe.”</p>
			<p>It had happened so many times before, too. The comfortable and established Universe had fitted all the known facts⁠—and then new facts had been learned that wouldn’t fit it. The third planet of the Sol system had once been the center of the Universe, and then Terra, and Sol, and even the galaxy, had been forced to abdicate centricity. The atom had been indivisible⁠—until somebody divided it. There had been intangible substance that had permeated the Universe, because it had been necessary for the transmission of light⁠—until it was demonstrated to be unnecessary and nonexistent. And the speed of light had been the ultimate velocity, once, and could be exceeded no more than the atom could be divided. And light-speed had been constant, regardless of distance from source, and the Universe, to explain certain observed phenomena, had been believed to be expanding simultaneously in all directions. And the things that had happened in psychology, when psi-phenomena had become too obvious to be shrugged away.</p>
			<p>“And then, when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dandrik ordered you to drop this experiment, just when it was becoming interesting, you refused?”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, I couldn’t stop, not then. But <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dandrik ordered the apparatus dismantled and scrapped, and I’m afraid I lost my head. Told him I’d punch his silly old face in, for one thing.”</p>
			<p>“You admit that?” Chancellor Khane cried.</p>
			<p>“I think you showed admirable self-restraint in not doing it. Did you explain to Chancellor Khane the importance of this experiment?”</p>
			<p>“I tried to, Your Majesty, but he simply wouldn’t listen.”</p>
			<p>“But, Your Majesty!” Khane expostulated. “Professor Dandrik is head of the department, and one of the foremost physicists of the Empire, and this young man is only one of the junior assistant-professors. Isn’t even a full professor, and he got his degree from some school away off-planet. University of Brannerton on Gimli.”</p>
			<p>“Were you a pupil of Professor Vann Evaratt?” Prince Travann asked sharply.</p>
			<p>“Why, yes, sir. I⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Ha, no wonder!” Dandrik crowed. “Your Majesty, that man’s an out-and-out charlatan! He was kicked out of the University here ten years ago, and I’m surprised he could even get on the faculty of a school like Brannerton, on a planet like Gimli.”</p>
			<p>“Why, you stupid old fool!” Faress yelled at him. “You aren’t enough of a physicist to oil robots in Vann Evaratt’s lab!”</p>
			<p>“There, Your Majesty,” Khane said. “You see how much respect for authority this hooligan has!”</p>
			<p>On Aditya, such would be unthinkable; on Aditya, everybody respects authority. Whether it’s respectable or not.</p>
			<p>Count Tammsan laughed, and he realized that he must have spoken aloud. Nobody else seemed to have gotten the joke.</p>
			<p>“Well, how about the riot, now?” he asked. “Who started that?”</p>
			<p>“Colonel Handrosan made an investigation on the spot,” Prince Travann said. “May I suggest that we hear his report?”</p>
			<p>“Yes indeed. Colonel?”</p>
			<p>Handrosan rose and stood with his hands behind his back, looking fixedly at the wall behind the desk.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty, the students of Professor Faress’ advanced subnuclear physics class, postgraduate students, all of them, were told of Professor Faress’ dismissal by a faculty member who had taken over the class this morning. They all got up and walked out in a body, and gathered outdoors on the campus to discuss the matter. At the next class break, they were joined by other science students, and they went into the stadium, where they were joined, half an hour later, by more students who had learned of the dismissal in the meantime. At no time was the gathering disorderly. The stadium is covered by a viewscreen pickup which is fitted with a recording device; there is a complete audiovisual of the whole thing, including the attack on them by the campus police.</p>
			<p>“This attack was ordered by Chancellor Khane, at about 1100; the chief of the campus police was told to clear the stadium, and when he asked if he was to use force, Chancellor Khane told him to use anything he wanted to.”</p>
			<p>“I did not! I told him to get the students out of the stadium, but⁠—”</p>
			<p>“The chief of campus police carries a personal wire recorder,” Handrosan said, in his flat monotone. “He has a recording of the order, in Chancellor Khane’s own voice. I heard it myself. The police,” he continued, “first tried to use gas, but the wind was against them. They then tried to use sono-stunners, but the students rushed them and overwhelmed them. If Your Majesty will permit a personal opinion, while I do not sympathize with their subsequent attack on the Administration Center, they were entirely within their rights in defending themselves in the stadium, and it’s hard enough to stop trained and disciplined troops when they are winning. After defeating the police, they simply went on by what might be called the momentum of victory.”</p>
			<p>“Then you’d say that it’s positively established that the students were behaving in a peacable and orderly manner in the stadium when they were attacked, and that Chancellor Khane ordered the attack personally?”</p>
			<p>“I would, emphatically, Your Majesty.”</p>
			<p>“I think we’ve done enough here, gentlemen.” He turned to Count Tammsan. “This is, jointly, the affair of Education and Security. I would suggest that you and Prince Travann join in a formal and public inquiry, and until all the facts have been established and recorded and action decided upon, the dismissal of Professor Faress be reversed and he be restored to his position on the faculty.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Your Majesty,” Tammsan agreed. “And I think it would be a good idea for Chancellor Khane to take a vacation till then, too.”</p>
			<p>“I would further suggest that, as this microposito experiment is crucial to the whole question, it should be repeated. Under the personal direction of Professor Faress.”</p>
			<p>“I agree with that, Your Majesty,” Prince Travann said. “If it’s as important as I think it is, Professor Dandrik is greatly to be censured for ordering it stopped and for failing to report this anticipation effect.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll consult about the inquiry, including the experiment, tomorrow, Your Highness,” Tammsan told Travann.</p>
			<p>Paul rose, and everybody rose with him. “That being the case, you gentlemen are all excused. The students’ procession ought to be arriving, now, and I want to tell them what’s going to be done. Prince Travann, Count Tammsan; do you care to accompany me?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Going up to the central terrace in front of the Octagon Tower, he turned to Count Tammsan.</p>
			<p>“I notice you laughed at that remark of mine about Aditya,” he said. “Have you met the First Citizen?”</p>
			<p>“Only on screen, sir. He was at me for about an hour, this morning. It seems that they are reforming the educational system on Aditya. On Aditya, everything gets reformed every ten years, whether it needs it or not. He came here to find somebody to take charge of the reformation.”</p>
			<p>He stopped short, bringing the others to a halt beside him, and laughed heartily.</p>
			<p>“Well, we’ll send First Citizen Yaggo away happy; we’ll make him a present of the most distinguished educator on Odin.”</p>
			<p>“Khane?” Tammsan asked.</p>
			<p>“Khane. Isn’t it wonderful; if you have a few problems, you have trouble, but if you have a whole lot of problems, they start solving each other. We get a chance to get rid of Khane and create a vacancy that can be filled by somebody big enough to fill it; the Ministry of Education gets out from under a nasty situation; First Citizen Yaggo gets what he thinks he wants⁠—”</p>
			<p>“And if I know Khane and if I know the People’s Commonwealth of Aditya, it won’t be a year before Yaggo has Khane shot or stuffs him into jail, and then the Space Navy will have an excuse to visit Aditya, and Aditya’ll never be the same afterward,” Prince Travann added.</p>
			<p>The students massed on the front lawns were still cheering as they went down after addressing them. The Security Guards were conspicuously absent and it was a detail of red-kilted Thoran riflemen who met them as they entered the hall to the Session Chamber. Prince Ganzay approached, attended by two Household Guard officers, a human and a Thoran. Count Tammsan looked from one to the other of his companions, bewildered. The bewildering thing was that everything was as it should be.</p>
			<p>“Well, gentlemen,” Paul said, “I’m sure that both of you will want to confer for a moment with your colleagues in the Rotunda before the Session. Please don’t feel obliged to attend me further.”</p>
			<p>Prince Ganzay approached as they went down the hall. “Your Majesty, what <em>is</em> going on here?” he demanded querulously. “Just who is in control of the Palace⁠—you or Prince Travann? And where is His Imperial Highness, and where is General Dorflay?”</p>
			<p>“I sent Dorflay to join Prince Rodrik’s picnic party. If you’re upset about this, you can imagine what he might have done here.”</p>
			<p>Prince Ganzay looked at him curiously for a moment. “I thought I understood what was happening,” he said. “Now I⁠—This business about the students, sir; how did it come out?”</p>
			<p>Paul told him. They talked for a while, and then the Prime Minister looked at his watch, and suggested that the Session ought to be getting started. Paul nodded, and they went down the hall and into the Rotunda.</p>
			<p>The big semicircular lobby was empty, now, except for a platoon of Household Guards, and the Empress Marris and her ladies-in-waiting. She advanced as quickly as her sheath gown would permit, and took his arm; the ladies-in-waiting fell in behind her, and Prince Ganzay went ahead, crying: “My Lords, Your Venerable Highnesses, gentlemen; His Imperial Majesty!”</p>
			<p>Marris tightened her grip on his arm as they started forward. “Paul!” she hissed into his ear. “What is this silly story about Yorn Travann trying to seize the Throne?”</p>
			<p>“Isn’t it? Yorn’s been too close the Throne for too long not to know what sort of a seat it is. He’d commit any crime up to and including genocide to keep off it.”</p>
			<p>She gave a quick skip to get into step with him. “Then why’s he filled the Palace with these blackcoats? Is Rod all right?”</p>
			<p>“Perfectly all right; he’s somewhere out in the mountains, keeping Harv Dorflay out of mischief.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They crossed the Session Hall and took their seats on the double throne; everybody sat down, and the Prime Minister, after some formalities, declared the Plenary Session in being. Almost at once, one of the Prince-Counselors was on his feet begging His Majesty’s leave to interrogate the Government.</p>
			<p>“I wish to ask His Highness the Minister of Security the meaning of all this unprecedented disturbance, both here in the Palace and in the city,” he said.</p>
			<p>Prince Travann rose at once. “Your Majesty, in reply to the question of His Venerable Highness,” he began, and then launched himself into an account of the student riot, the march to petition the emperor, and the clash with the nonworking class hooligans. “As to the affair at the University, I hesitate to speak on what is really the concern of His Lordship the Minister of Education, but as to the fighting in the city, if it is still going on, I can assure His Venerable Highness that the Gendarmes and Security Guards have it well in hand; the persons responsible are being rounded up, and, if the Minister of Justice concurs, an inquiry will be started tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>The Minister of Justice assured the Minister of Security that his Ministry would be quite ready to cooperate in the inquiry. Count Tammsan then got up and began talking about the riot at the University.</p>
			<p>“What did happen, Paul?” Marris whispered.</p>
			<p>“Chancellor Khane sacked a science professor for being too interested in science. The students didn’t like it. I think Khane’s successor will rectify that. Have a good time at the Flower Festivals?”</p>
			<p>She raised her fan to hide a grimace. “I made my schedule,” she said. “Tomorrow, I have fifty more booked.”</p>
			<p>“Your Imperial Majesty!” The Counselor who had risen paused, to make sure that he had the Imperial attention, before continuing: “Inasmuch as this question also seems to involve a scientific experiment, I would suggest that the Ministry of Science and Technology is also interested and since there is at present no Minister holding that portfolio, I would suggest that the discussion be continued after a Minister has been elected.”</p>
			<p>The Minister of Health and Sanity jumped to his feet.</p>
			<p>“Your Imperial Majesty; permit me to concur with the proposal of His Venerable Highness, and to extend it with the subproposal that the Ministry of Science and Technology be abolished, and its functions and personnel divided among the other Ministries, specifically those of Education and of Economics.”</p>
			<p>The Minister of Fine Arts was up before he was fully seated.</p>
			<p>“Your Imperial Majesty; permit me to concur with the proposal of Count Guilfred, and to extend it further with the proposal that the Ministry of Defense, now also vacant, be likewise abolished, and its functions and personnel added to the Ministry of Security under His Highness Prince Travann.”</p>
			<p>So that was it! Marris, beside him, said, “Well!” He had long ago discovered that she could pack more meaning into that monosyllable than the average counselor could into a half-hour’s speech. Prince Ganzay was thunderstruck, and from the Bench of Counselors six or eight voices were babbling loudly at once. Four Ministers were on their feet clamoring for recognition; Count Duklass of Economics was yelling the loudest, so he got it.</p>

			<p>“Your Imperial Majesty; it would have been most unseemly in me to have spoken in favor of the proposal of Count Guilfred, being an interested party, but I feel no such hesitation in concurring with the proposal of Baron Garatt, the Minister of Fine Arts. Indeed, I consider it a most excellent proposal⁠—”</p>
			<p>“And I consider it the most diabolically dangerous proposal to be made in this Hall in the last six centuries!” old Admiral Gaklar shouted. “This is a proposal to concentrate all the armed force of the Empire in the hands of one man. Who can say what unscrupulous use might be made of such power?”</p>
			<p>“Are you intimating, Prince-Counselor, that Prince Travann is contemplating some tyrannical or subversive use of such power?” Count Tammsan, of all people, demanded.</p>
			<p>There was a concerted gasp at that; about half the Plenary Session were absolutely sure that he was. Admiral Geklar backed quickly away from the question.</p>
			<p>“Prince Travann will not be the last Minister of Security,” he said.</p>
			<p>“What I was about to say, Your Majesty, is that as matters stand, Security has a virtual monopoly on armed power on this planet. When these disorders in the city⁠—which Prince Travann’s men are now bringing under control⁠—broke out, there was, I am informed, an order sent out to bring Regular Army and Planetary Militia into Asgard. It will be hours before any of the former can arrive, and at least a day before the latter can even be mobilized. By the time any of them get here, there will be nothing for them to do. Is that not correct, Prince Ganzay?”</p>
			<p>The Prime Minister looked at him angrily, stung by the realization that somebody else had a personal intelligence service as good as his own, then swallowed his anger and assented.</p>
			<p>“Furthermore,” Count Duklass continued, “the Ministry of Defense, itself, is an anachronism, which no doubt accounts for the condition in which we now find it. The Empire has no external enemies whatever; all our defense problems are problems of internal security. Let us therefore turn the facilities over to the Ministry responsible for the tasks.”</p>
			<p>The debate went on and on; he paid less and less attention to it, and it became increasingly obvious that opposition to the proposition was dwindling. Cries of, “Vote! Vote!” began to be heard from its supporters. Prince Ganzay rose from his desk and came to the throne.</p>
			<p>“Your Imperial Majesty,” he said softly. “I am opposed to this proposition, but I am convinced that enough favor it to pass it, even over Your Majesty’s veto. Before the vote is called, does Your Majesty wish my resignation?”</p>
			<p>He rose and stepped down beside the Prime Minister, putting an arm over Prince Ganzay’s shoulder.</p>
			<p>“Far from it, old friend,” he said, in a distinctly audible voice. “I will have too much need for you. But, as for the proposal, I don’t oppose it. I think it an excellent one; it has my approval.” He lowered his voice. “As soon as it’s passed, place General Dorflay’s name in nomination.”</p>
			<p>The Prime Minister looked at him sadly for a moment, then nodded, returning to his desk, where he rapped for order and called for the vote.</p>
			<p>“Well, if you can’t lick them, join them,” Marris said as he sat down beside her. “And if they start chasing you, just yell, ‘There he goes; follow me!’ ”</p>
			<p>The proposal carried, almost unanimously. Prince Ganzay then presented the name of Captain-General Dorflay for elevation to the Bench of Counselors, and the emperor decreed it. As soon as the Session was adjourned and he could do so, he slipped out the little door behind the throne, into an elevator.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>In the room at the top of the Octagon Tower, he laid aside his belt and dress dagger and unfastened his tunic, than sat down in his deep chair and called a serving robot. It was the one which had brought him his breakfast, and he greeted it as a friend; it lit a cigarette for him, and poured a drink of brandy. For a long time he sat, smoking and sipping and looking out the wide window to the west, where the orange sun was firing the clouds behind the mountains, and he realized that he was abominably tired. Well, no wonder; more Empire history had been made today than in the years since he had come to the Throne.</p>
			<p>Then something behind him clicked. He turned his head, to see Yorn Travann emerge from the concealed elevator. He grinned and lifted his drink in greeting.</p>
			<p>“I thought you’d be a little late,” he said. “Everybody trying to climb onto the bandwagon?”</p>
			<p>Yorn Travann came forward, unbuckling his belt and laying it with Paul’s; he sank into the chair opposite, and the robot poured him a drink.</p>
			<p>“Well, do you blame them? What would it have looked like to you, in their place?”</p>
			<p>“A coup d’etat. For that matter, wasn’t that what it was? Why didn’t you tell me you were springing it?”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t spring it; it was sprung on me. I didn’t know a thing about it till Max Duklass buttonholed me down by the landing stage. I’d intended fighting this proposal to partition Science and Technology, but this riot blew up and scared Duklass and Tammsan and Guilfred and the rest of them. They weren’t too sure of their majority⁠—that’s why they had the election postponed a couple of times⁠—but they were sure that the riot would turn some of the undecided Counselors against them. So they offered to back me to take over Defense in exchange for my supporting their proposal. It looked too good to pass up.”</p>
			<p>“Even at the price of wrecking Science and Technology?”</p>
			<p>“It was wrecked, or left to rust into uselessness, long ago. The main function of Technology has been to suppress anything that might threaten this state of economic rigor mortis that Duklass calls stability, and the function of Science has been to let muttonheads like Khane and Dandrik dominate the teaching of science. Well, Defense has its own scientific and technical sections, and when we come to carving the bird, Duklass and Tammsan are going to see a lot of slices going onto my plate.”</p>
			<p>“And when it’s all cut up, it will be discovered that there is no provision for original research. So it will please My Majesty to institute an Imperial Office of Scientific Research, independent of any Ministry, and guess who’ll be named to head it.”</p>
			<p>“Faress. And, by the way, we’re all set on Khane, too. First Citizen Yaggo is as delighted to have him as we are to get rid of him. Why don’t we get Vann Evaratt back, and give him the job?”</p>
			<p>“Good. If he takes charge there at the opening of the next academic year, in ten years we’ll have a thousand young men, maybe ten times that many, who won’t be afraid of new things and new ideas. But the main thing is that now you have Defense, and now the plan can really start firing all jets.”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” Yorn Travann got out his cigarettes and lit one. Paul glanced at the robot, hoping that its feelings hadn’t been hurt. “All these native uprisings I’ve been blowing up out of inter-tribal knife fights, and all these civil wars my people have been manufacturing; there’ll be more of them, and I’ll start yelling my head off for an adequate Space Navy, and after we get it, these local troubles will all stop, and then what’ll we be expected to do? Scrap the ships?”</p>
			<p>They both knew what would be done with some of them. It would have to be done stealthily, while nobody was looking, but some of those ships would go far beyond the boundaries of the Empire, and new things would happen. New worlds, new problems. Great and frightening changes.</p>
			<p>“Paul, we agreed upon this long ago, when we were still boys at the University. The Empire stopped growing, and when things stop growing, they start dying, the death of petrifaction. And when petrifaction is complete, the cracking and the crumbling starts, and there’s no way of stopping it. But if we can get people out onto new planets, the Empire won’t die; it’ll start growing again.”</p>
			<p>“You didn’t start that thing at the University, this morning, yourself, did you?”</p>
			<p>“Not the student riot, no. But the hooligan attack, yes. That was some of my own men. The real hooligans began looting after Handrosan had gotten the students out of the district. We collared all of them, including their boss, Nutchy the Knife, right away, and as soon as we did that, Big Moogie and Zikko the Nose tried to move in. We’re cleaning them up now. By tomorrow morning there won’t be one of these nonworkers’ voting blocks left in Asgard, and by the end of the week they’ll be cleaned up all over Odin. I have discovered a plot, and they’re all involved in it.”</p>
			<p>“Wait a moment.” Paul got to his feet. “That reminds me; Harv Dorflay’s hiding Rod and Olva out in the mountains. I wanted him out of here while things were happening. I’ll have to call him and tell him it’s safe to come in, now.”</p>
			<p>“Well, zip up your tunic and put your dagger on; you look as though you’d been arrested, disarmed and searched.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right.” He hastily repaired his appearance and went to the screen across the room, punching out the combination of the screen with Rodrik’s picnic party.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A young lieutenant of the Household Troops appeared in it, and had to be reassured. He got General Dorflay.</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty! You are all right?”</p>
			<p>“Perfectly all right, general, and it’s quite safe to bring His Imperial Highness in. The conspiracy against the Throne has been crushed.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, thank the gods! Is Prince Travann a prisoner?”</p>
			<p>“Quite the contrary, general. It was our loyal and devoted subject, Prince Travann, who crushed the conspiracy.”</p>
			<p>“But⁠—But, Your Majesty⁠—!”</p>
			<p>“You aren’t to be blamed for suspecting him, general. His agents were working in the very innermost councils of the conspirators. Every one of the people whom you suspected⁠—with excellent reason⁠—was actually working to defeat the plot. Think back, general; the scheme to put the gun in the viewscreen, the scheme to sabotage the elevator, the scheme to introduce assassins into the orchestra with guns built into their trumpets⁠—every one came to your notice because of what seemed to be some indiscretion of the plotters, didn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“Why⁠ ⁠… why, yes, Your Majesty!” By this time tomorrow, he would have a complete set of memories for each one of them. “You mean, the indiscretions were deliberate?”</p>
			<p>“Your vigilance and loyalty made it necessary for them to resort to these fantastic expedients, and your vigilance defeated them as fast as they came to your notice. Well, today, Prince Travann and I struck back. I may tell you, in confidence, that every one of the conspirators is dead. Killed in this afternoon’s rioting⁠—which was incited for that purpose by Prince Travann.”</p>
			<p>“Then⁠—Then there will be no more plots against your life?” There was a note of regret in the old man’s voice.</p>
			<p>“No more, Your Venerable Highness.”</p>
			<p>“But⁠—What did Your Majesty call me?” he asked incredulously.</p>
			<p>“I took the honor of being the first to address you by your new title, Prince-Counselor Dorflay.”</p>
			<p>He left the old man overcome, and blubbering happily on the shoulder of the Crown Prince, who winked at his father out of the screen. Prince Travann had gotten a couple of fresh drinks from the robot and handed one to him when he returned to his chair.</p>
			<p>“He’ll be finding the Bench of Counselors riddled with treason inside a week,” Travann said. “You handled that just right, though. Another case of making problems solve each other.”</p>
			<p>“You were telling me about a plot you’d discovered.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes: this is one to top Dorflay’s best efforts. All the voting-bloc bosses on Odin are in a conspiracy to start a civil war to give them a chance to loot the planet. There isn’t a word of truth in it, of course, but it’ll do to arrest and hold them for a few days, and by that time some of my undercovers will be in control of every nonworker vote on the planet. After all, the Cartels put an end to competition in every other business; why not a Voting Cartel, too? Then, whenever there’s an election, we just advertise for bids.”</p>
			<p>“Why, that would mean absolute control⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Of the nonworking vote, yes. And I’ll guarantee, personally, that in five years the politics of Odin will have become so unbearably corrupt and abusive that the intellectuals, the technicians, the business people, even the nobility, will be flocking to the polls to vote, and if only half of them turn out, they’ll snow the nonworkers under. And that’ll mean, eventually, an end to vote-selling, and the nonworkers’ll have to find work. We’ll find it for them.”</p>
			<p>“Great and frightening changes.” Yorn Travann laughed; he recognized the phrase. Probably started it himself. Paul lifted his glass. “To the Minister of Disturbance!”</p>
			<p>“Your Majesty!” They drank to each other, and then Yorn Travann said, “We had a lot of wild dreams, when we were boys; it looks as though we’re starting to make some of them come true. You know, when we were in the University, the students would never have done what they did today. They didn’t even do it ten years ago, when Vann Evaratt was dismissed.”</p>
			<p>“And Van Evaratt’s pupil came back to Odin and touched this whole thing off.” He thought for a moment. “I wonder what Faress has, in that anticipation effect.”</p>
			<p>“I think I can see what can come out of it. If he can propagate a wave that behaves like those micropositos, we may not have to depend on ships for communication. We may be able, some day, to screen Baldur or Vishnu or Aton or Thor as easily as you screened Dorflay, up in the mountains.” He thought silently for a moment. “I don’t know whether that would be good or bad. But it would be new, and that’s what matters. That’s the only thing that matters.”</p>
			<p>“Flower Festivals,” Paul said, and, when Yorn Travann wanted to know what he meant, he told him. “When Princess Olva’s Empress, she’s going to curse the name of Klenn Faress. Flower Festivals, all around the galaxy, without end.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Naudsonce</h2>
			<p>The sun warmed Mark Howell’s back pleasantly. Underfoot, the mosslike stuff was soft and yielding, and there was a fragrance in the air unlike anything he had ever smelled. He was going to like this planet; he knew it. The question was, how would it, and its people, like him? He watched the little figures advancing across the fields from the mound, with the village out of sight on the other end of it and the combat-car circling lazily on contragravity above.</p>
			<p>Major Luis Gofredo, the Marine officer, spoke without lowering his binoculars:</p>
			<p>“They have a tubular thing about twelve feet long; six of them are carrying it on poles, three to a side, and a couple more are walking behind it. Mark, do you think it could be a cannon?”</p>
			<p>So far, he didn’t know enough to have an opinion, and said so, adding:</p>
			<p>“What I saw of the village in the screen from the car, it looked pretty primitive. Of course, gunpowder’s one of those things a primitive people could discover by accident, if the ingredients were available.”</p>
			<p>“We won’t take any chances, then.”</p>
			<p>“You think they’re hostile? I was hoping they were coming out to parley with us.”</p>
			<p>That was Paul Meillard. He had a right to be anxious; his whole future in the Colonial Office would be made or ruined by what was going to happen here.</p>
			<p>The joint Space Navy-Colonial Office expedition was looking for new planets suitable for colonization; they had been out, now, for four years, which was close to maximum for an exploring expedition. They had entered eleven systems, and made landings on eight planets. Three had been reasonably close to Terra-type. There had been Fafnir; conditions there would correspond to Terra during the Cretaceous Period, but any Cretaceous dinosaur would have been cute and cuddly to the things on Fafnir. Then there had been Imhotep; in twenty or thirty thousand years, it would be a fine planet, but at present it was undergoing an extensive glaciation. And Irminsul, covered with forests of gigantic trees; it would have been fine except for the fauna, which was nasty, especially a race of subsapient near-humanoids who had just gotten as far as clubs and <i xml:lang="fr">coup-de-poing</i> axes. Contact with them had entailed heavy ammunition expenditure, with two men and a woman killed and a dozen injured. He’d had a limp, himself, for a while as a result.</p>
			<p>As for the other five, one had been an all-out hell-planet, and the rest had been the sort that get colonized by irreconcilable minority-groups who want to get away from everybody else. The Colonial Office wouldn’t even consider any of them.</p>
			<p>Then they had found this one, third of a G0-star, eighty million miles from primary, less axial inclination than Terra, which would mean a more uniform year-round temperature, and about half land surface. On the evidence of a couple of sneak landings for specimens, the biochemistry was identical with Terra’s and the organic matter was edible. It was the sort of planet every explorer dreams of finding, except for one thing.</p>
			<p>It was inhabited by a sapient humanoid race, and some of them were civilized enough to put it in Class <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, and Colonial Office doctrine on Class <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> planets was rigid. Friendly relations with the natives had to be established, and permission to settle had to be guaranteed in a treaty of some sort with somebody more or less authorized to make one.</p>
			<p>If Paul Meillard could accomplish that, he had it made. He would stay on with forty or fifty of the ship’s company to make preparations. In a year a couple of ships would come out from Terra, with a thousand colonists, and a battalion or so of Federation troops, to protect them from the natives and vice versa. Meillard would automatically be appointed governor-general.</p>
			<p>But if he failed, he was through. Not out⁠—just through. When he got back to Terra, he would be promoted to some home office position at slightly higher base pay but without the three hundred percent extraterrestrial bonus, and he would vegetate there till he retired. Every time his name came up, somebody would say, “Oh, yes; he flubbed the contact on Whatzit.”</p>
			<p>It wouldn’t do the rest of them any good, either. There would always be the suspicion that they had contributed to the failure.</p>
			<p>
				<i>Bwaaa-waaa-waaanh!</i>
			</p>
			<p>The wavering sound hung for an instant in the air. A few seconds later, it was repeated, then repeated again.</p>
			<p>“Our cannon’s a horn,” Gofredo said. “I can’t see how they’re blowing it, though.”</p>
			<p>There was a stir to right and left, among the Marines deployed in a crescent line on either side of the contact team; a metallic clatter as weapons were checked. A shadow fell in front of them as a combat-car moved into position above.</p>
			<p>“What do you suppose it means?” Meillard wondered.</p>
			<p>“Terrans, go home.” He drew a frown from Meillard with the suggestion. “Maybe it’s supposed to intimidate us.”</p>
			<p>“They’re probably doing it to encourage themselves,” Anna de Jong, the psychologist, said. “I’ll bet they’re really scared stiff.”</p>
			<p>“I see how they’re blowing it,” Gofredo said. “The man who’s walking behind it has a hand-bellows.” He raised his voice. “Fix bayonets! These people don’t know anything about rifles, but they know what spears are. They have some of their own.”</p>
			<p>So they had. The six who walked in the lead were unarmed, unless the thing one of them carried was a spear. So, it seemed, were the horn-bearers. Behind them, however, in an open-order skirmish-line, came fifty-odd with weapons. Most of them had spears, the points glinting redly. Bronze, with a high copper content. A few had bows. They came slowly; details became more plainly visible.</p>
			<p>The leader wore a long yellow robe; the thing in his hand was a bronze-headed staff. Three of his companions also wore robes; the other two were barelegged in short tunics. The horn-bearers wore either robes or tunics; the spearmen and bowmen behind either wore tunics or were naked except for breechclouts. All wore sandals. They were red-brown in color, completely hairless; they had long necks, almost chinless lower jaws, and fleshy, beaklike noses that gave them an avian appearance which was heightened by red crests, like roosters’ combs, on the tops of their heads.</p>
			<p>“Well, aren’t they something to see?” Lillian Ransby, the linguist asked.</p>
			<p>“I wonder how we look to them,” Paul Meillard said.</p>
			<p>That was something to wonder about, too. The differences between one and another of the Terrans must puzzle them. Paul Meillard, as close to being a pure Negro as anybody in the Seventh Century of the Atomic Era was to being pure anything. Lillian Ransby, almost ash-blond. Major Gofredo, barely over the minimum Service height requirement; his name was Old Terran Spanish, but his ancestry must have been Polynesian, Amerind and Mongolian. Karl Dorver, the sociographer, six feet six, with red hair. Bennet Fayon, the biologist and physiologist, plump, pink-faced and balding. Willi Schallenmacher, with a bushy black beard.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>They didn’t have any ears, he noticed, and then he was taking stock of the things they wore and carried. Belts, with pouches, and knives with flat bronze blades and riveted handles. Three of the delegation had small flutes hung by cords around their necks, and a fourth had a reed Pan-pipe. No shields, and no swords; that was good. Swords and shields mean organized warfare, possibly a warrior-caste. This crowd weren’t warriors. The spearmen and bowmen weren’t arrayed for battle, but for a drive-hunt, with the bows behind the spears to stop anything that broke through the line.</p>
			<p>“All right; let’s go meet them.” The querulous, uncertain note was gone from Meillard’s voice; he knew what to do and how to do it.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Gofredo called to the Marines to stand fast. Then they were advancing to meet the natives, and when they were twenty feet apart, both groups halted. The horn stopped blowing. The one in the yellow robe lifted his staff and said something that sounded like, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Tweedle-eedle-oodly-eenk.</i>”</p>
			<p>The horn, he saw, was made of strips of leather, wound spirally and coated with some kind of varnish. Everything these people had was carefully and finely made. An old culture, but a static one. Probably tradition-bound as all get-out.</p>
			<p>Meillard was raising his hands; solemnly he addressed the natives:</p>
			<p>“ ’Twas brillig and the slithy toves were whooping it up in the Malemute Saloon, and the kid that handled the music box did gyre and gimble in the wabe, and back of the bar in a solo game all mimsy were the borogoves, and the mome raths outgabe the lady that’s known as Lou.”</p>
			<p>That was supposed to show them that we, too, have a spoken language, to prove that their language and ours were mutually incomprehensible, and to demonstrate the need for devising a means of communication. At least that was what the book said. It demonstrated nothing of the sort to this crowd. It scared them. The dignitary with the staff twittered excitedly. One of his companions agreed with him at length. Another started to reach for his knife, then remembered his manners. The bellowsman pumped a few blasts on the horn.</p>
			<p>“What do you think of the language?” he asked Lillian.</p>
			<p>“They all sound that bad, when you first hear them. Give them a few seconds, and then we’ll have Phase Two.”</p>
			<p>When the gibbering and skreeking began to fall off, she stepped forward. Lillian was, herself, a good test of how human aliens were; this gang weren’t human enough to whistle at her. She touched herself on the breast. “Me,” she said.</p>
			<p>The natives seemed shocked. She repeated the gesture and the word, then turned and addressed Paul Meillard. “You.”</p>
			<p>“Me,” Meillard said, pointing to himself. Then he said, “You,” to Luis Gofredo. It went around the contact team; when it came to him, he returned it to point of origin.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think they get it at all,” he added in a whisper.</p>
			<p>“They ought to,” Lillian said. “Every language has a word for self and a word for person-addressed.”</p>
			<p>“Well, look at them,” Karl Dorver invited. “Six different opinions about what we mean, and now the band’s starting an argument of their own.”</p>
			<p>“Phase Two-A,” Lillian said firmly, stepping forward. She pointed to herself. “Me⁠—Lillian Ransby. Lillian Ransby⁠—me <em>name</em>. You⁠—<em>name?</em>”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Bwoooo!</i>” the spokesman screamed in horror, clutching his staff as though to shield it from profanation. The others howled like a hound-pack at a full moon, except one of the short-tunic boys, who was slapping himself on the head with both hands and yodeling. The horn-crew hastily swung their piece around at the Terrans, pumping frantically.</p>
			<p>“What do you suppose I said?” Lillian asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, something like, ‘Curse your gods, death to your king, and spit in your mother’s face,’ I suppose.”</p>
			<p>“Let me try it,” Gofredo said.</p>
			<p>The little Marine major went through the same routine. At his first word, the uproar stopped; before he was through, the natives’ faces were sagging and crumbling into expressions of utter and heartbroken grief.</p>
			<p>“It’s not as bad as all that, is it?” he said. “You try it, Mark.”</p>
			<p>“Me.⁠ ⁠… Mark.⁠ ⁠… Howell.⁠ ⁠…” They looked bewildered.</p>
			<p>“Let’s try objects, and playacting,” Lillian suggested. “They’re farmers; they ought to have a word for water.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They spent almost an hour at it. They poured out two gallons of water, pretended to be thirsty, gave each other drinks. The natives simply couldn’t agree on the word, in their own language, for water. That or else they missed the point of the whole act. They tried fire, next. The efficiency of a steel hatchet was impressive, and so was the sudden flame of a pocket-lighter, but no word for fire emerged, either.</p>
			<p>“Ah, to Niflheim with it!” Luis Gofredo cried in exasperation. “We’re getting nowhere at five times light speed. Give them their presents and send them home, Paul.”</p>
			<p>“Sheath-knives; they’ll have to be shown how sharp they are,” he suggested. “Red bandannas. And costume jewelry.”</p>
			<p>“How about something to eat, Bennet?” Meillard asked Fayon.</p>
			<p>“Extee Three, and <abbr>C-H</abbr> trade candy,” Fayon said. Field Ration, Extraterrestrial Service, Type Three, could be eaten by anything with a carbon-hydrogen metabolism, and so could the trade candy. “Nothing else, though, till we have some idea what goes on inside them.”</p>
			<p>Dorver thought the six members of the delegation would be persons of special consequence, and should have something extra. That was probably so. Dorver was as quick to pick up clues to an alien social order as he was, himself, to deduce a culture pattern from a few artifacts. He and Lillian went back to the landing craft to collect the presents.</p>
			<p>Everybody, horn-detail, armed guard and all, got one ten-inch bowie knife and sheath, a red bandanna neckcloth, and a piece of flashy junk jewelry. The (town council? prominent citizens? or what?) also received a colored table-spread apiece; these were draped over their shoulders and fastened with two-inch plastic pins advertising the candidacy of somebody for President of the Federation Member Republic of Venus a couple of elections ago. They all looked woebegone about it; that would be their expression of joy. Different type nerves and different facial musculature, Fayon thought. As soon as they sampled the Extee Three and candy, they looked crushed under all the sorrows of the galaxy.</p>
			<p>By pantomime and pointing to the sun, Meillard managed to inform them that the next day, when the sun was in the same position, the Terrans would visit their village, bringing more gifts. The natives were quite agreeable, but Meillard was disgruntled that he had to use sign-talk. The natives started off toward the village on the mound, munching Extee Three and trying out their new knives. This time tomorrow, half of them would have bandaged thumbs.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Marine riflemen and submachine-gunners were coming in, slinging their weapons and lighting cigarettes. A couple of Navy technicians were getting a snooper⁠—a thing shaped like a short-tailed tadpole, six feet long by three at the widest, fitted with visible-light and infrared screen pickups and crammed with detection instruments⁠—ready to relieve the combat car over the village. The contact team crowded into the Number One landing craft, which had been fitted out as a temporary headquarters. Prefab-hut elements were already being unloaded from the other craft.</p>
			<p>Everybody felt that a drink was in order, even if it was two hours short of cocktail time. They carried bottles and glasses and ice to the front of the landing craft and sat down in front of the battery of view and communication screens. The central screen was a two-way, tuned to one in the officers’ lounge aboard the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hubert Penrose</i>, two hundred miles above. In it, also provided with drinks, were Captain Guy Vindinho and two other Navy officers, and a Marine captain in shipboard blues. Like Gofredo, Vindinho must have gotten into the Service on tiptoe; he had a bald dome and a red beard, and he always looked as though he were gloating because nobody knew that his name was really Rumplestiltskin. He had been watching the contact by screen. He lifted his glass toward Meillard.</p>
			<p>“Over the hump, Paul?”</p>
			<p>Meillard raised his drink to Vindinho. “Over the first one. There’s a whole string of them ahead. At least, we sent them away happy. I hope.”</p>
			<p>“You’re going to make permanent camp where you are now?” one of the other officers asked. Lieutenant-Commander Dave Questell; ground engineering and construction officer. “What do you need?”</p>
			<p>There were two viewscreens from pickups aboard the 2500-foot battle cruiser. One, at ten-power magnification, gave a maplike view of the broad valley and the uplands and mountain foothills to the south. It was only by tracing the course of the main river and its tributaries that they could find the tiny spot of the native village, and they couldn’t see the landing craft at all. The other, at a hundred power, showed the oblong mound, with the village on its flat top, little dots around a circular central plaza. They could see the two turtle-shaped landing-craft, and the combat car, that had been circling over the mound, landing beside them, and, sometimes, a glint of sunlight from the snooper that had taken its place.</p>
			<p>The snooper was also transmitting in, to another screen, from two hundred feet above the village. From the sound outlet came an incessant gibber of native voices. There were over a hundred houses, all small and square, with pyramidal roofs. On the end of the mound toward the Terran camp, animals of at least four different species were crowded, cattle that had been herded up from the meadows at the first alarm. The open circle in the middle of the village was crowded, and more natives lined the low palisade along the edge of the mound.</p>
			<p>“Well, we’re going to stay here till we learn the language,” Meillard was saying. “This is the best place for it. It’s completely isolated, forests on both sides, and seventy miles to the nearest other village. If we’re careful, we can stay here as long as we want to and nobody’ll find out about us. Then, after we can talk with these people, we’ll go to the big town.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The big town was two hundred and fifty miles down the valley, at the forks of the main river, a veritable metropolis of almost three thousand people. That was where the treaty would have to be negotiated.</p>
			<p>“You’ll want more huts. You’ll want a water tank, and a pipeline to that stream below you, and a pump,” Questell said. “You think a month?”</p>
			<p>Meillard looked at Lillian Ransby. “What do you think?”</p>
			<p>“<em>Poodly-doodly-oodly-foodle</em>,” she said. “You saw how far we didn’t get this afternoon. All we found out was that none of the standard procedures work at all.” She made a tossing gesture over her shoulder. “There goes the book; we have to do it off the cuff from here.”</p>
			<p>“Suppose we make another landing, back in the mountains, say two or three hundred miles south of you,” Vindinho said. “It’s not right to keep the rest aboard two hundred miles off planet, and you won’t be wanting liberty parties coming down where you are.”</p>
			<p>“The country over there looks uninhabited,” Meillard said. “No villages, anyhow. That wouldn’t hurt, at all.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it’ll suit me,” Charley Loughran, the xeno-naturalist, said. “I want a chance to study the life-forms in a state of nature.”</p>
			<p>Vindinho nodded. “Luis, do you anticipate any trouble with this crowd here?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“How about it, Mark? What do they look like to you? Warlike?”</p>
			<p>“No.” He stated the opinion he had formed. “I had a close look at their weapons when they came in for their presents. Hunting arms. Most of the spears have cross-guards, usually wooden, lashed on, to prevent a wounded animal from running up the spear-shaft at the hunter. They made boar-spears like that on Terra a thousand years ago. Maybe they have to fight raiding parties from the hills once in a while, but not often enough for them to develop special fighting weapons or techniques.”</p>
			<p>“Their village is fortified,” Meillard mentioned.</p>
			<p>“I question that,” Gofredo differed. “There won’t be more than a total of five hundred there; call that a fighting strength of two hundred, to defend a twenty-five-hundred-meter perimeter, with woodchoppers’ axes and bows and spears. If you notice, there’s no wall around the village itself. That palisade is just a fence.”</p>
			<p>“Why would they mound the village up?” Questell, in the screen wondered. “You don’t think the river gets up that high, do you? Because if it does⁠—”</p>
			<p>Schallenmacher shook his head. “There just isn’t enough watershed, and there’s too much valley. I’ll be very much surprised if that stream, there”⁠—he nodded at the hundred-power screen⁠—“ever gets more than six inches over the bank.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what those houses are built of. This is all alluvial country; building stone would be almost unobtainable. I don’t see anything like a brick kiln. I don’t see any evidence of irrigation, either, so there must be plenty of rainfall. If they use adobe, or sun-dried brick, houses would start to crumble in a few years, and they would be pulled down and the rubble shoved aside to make room for a new house. The village has been rising on its own ruins, probably shifting back and forth from one end of that mound to the other.”</p>
			<p>“If that’s it, they’ve been there a long time,” Karl Dorver said. “And how far have they advanced?”</p>
			<p>“Early bronze; I’ll bet they still use a lot of stone implements. Pre-dynastic Egypt, or very early Tigris-Euphrates, in Terran terms. I can’t see any evidence that they have the wheel. They have draft animals; when we were coming down, I saw a few of them pulling pole travoises. I’d say they’ve been farming for a long time. They have quite a diversity of crops, and I suspect that they have some idea of crop-rotation. I’m amazed at their musical instruments; they seem to have put more skill into making them than anything else. I’m going to take a jeep, while they’re all in the village, and have a look around the fields, now.”</p>
			<p>Charley Loughran went along for specimens, and, for the ride, Lillian Ransby. Most of his guesses, he found, had been correct. He found a number of pole travoises, from which the animals had been unhitched in the first panic when the landing craft had been coming down. Some of them had big baskets permanently attached. There were drag-marks everywhere in the soft ground, but not a single wheel track. He found one plow, cunningly put together with wooden pegs and rawhide lashings; the point was stone, and it would only score a narrow groove, not a proper furrow. It was, however, fitted with a big bronze ring to which a draft animal could be hitched. Most of the cultivation seemed to have been done with spades and hoes. He found a couple of each, bronze, cast flat in an open-top mold. They hadn’t learned to make composite molds.</p>
			<p>There was an even wider variety of crops than he had expected: two cereals, a number of different root-plants, and a lot of different legumes, and things like tomatoes and pumpkins.</p>
			<p>“Bet these people had a pretty good life, here⁠—before the Terrans came,” Charley observed.</p>
			<p>“Don’t say that in front of Paul,” Lillian warned. “He has enough to worry about now, without starting him on whether we’ll do these people more harm than good.”</p>
			<p>Two more landing craft had come down from the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hubert Penrose</i>; they found Dave Questell superintending the unloading of more prefab-huts, and two were already up that had been brought down with the first landing.</p>
			<p>A name for the planet had also arrived.</p>
			<p>“Svantovit,” Karl Dorver told him. “Principal god of the Baltic Slavs, about three thousand years ago. Guy Vindinho dug it out of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Encyclopedia of Mythology</i>. Svantovit was represented as holding a bow in one hand and a horn in the other.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that fits. What will we call the natives; Svantovitians, or Svantovese?”</p>
			<p>“Well, Paul wanted to call them Svantovese, but Luis persuaded him to call them Svants. He said everybody’d call them that, anyhow, so we might as well make it official from the start.”</p>
			<p>“We can call the language Svantovese,” Lillian decided. “After dinner, I am going to start playing back recordings and running off audiovisuals. I will be so happy to know that I have a name for what I’m studying. Probably be all I will know.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>After dinner, he and Karl and Paul went into a huddle on what sort of gifts to give the natives, and the advisability of trading with them, and for what. Nothing too far in advance of their present culture level. Wheels; they could be made in the fabricating shop aboard the ship.</p>
			<p>“You know, it’s odd,” Karl Dorver said. “These people here have never seen a wheel, and, except in documentary or historical-drama films, neither have a lot of Terrans.”</p>
			<p>That was true. As a means of transportation, the wheel had been completely obsolete since the development of contragravity, six centuries ago. Well, a lot of Terrans in the Year Zero had never seen a suit of armor, or an harquebus, or even a tinder box or a spinning wheel.</p>
			<p>Wheelbarrows; now there was something they’d find useful. He screened Max Milzer, in charge of the fabricating and repair shops on the ship. Max had never even heard of a wheelbarrow.</p>
			<p>“I can make them up, Mark; better send me some drawings, though. Did you just invent it?”</p>
			<p>“As far as I know, a man named Leonardo da Vinci invented it, in the Sixth Century Pre-Atomic. How soon can you get me half a dozen of them?”</p>
			<p>“Well, let’s see. Welded sheet metal, and pipe for the frame and handles. I’ll have some of them for you by noon tomorrow. Now, about hoes; how tall are these people, and how long are their arms, and how far can they stoop over?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They were all up late, that night. So were the Svants; there was a fire burning in the middle of the village, and watch-fires along the edge of the mound. Luis Gofredo was just as distrustful of them as they were of the Terrans; he kept the camp lighted, a strong guard on the alert, and the area of darkness beyond infra red lighted and covered by photoelectric sentries on the ground and snoopers in the air. Like Paul Meillard, Luis Gofredo was a worrier and a pessimist. Everything happened for the worst in this worst of all possible galaxies, and if anything could conceivably go wrong, it infallibly would. That was probably why he was still alive and had never had a command massacred.</p>
			<p>The wheelbarrows, four of them, came down from the ship by midmorning. With them came a grindstone, a couple of crosscut saws, and a lot of picks and shovels and axes, and cases of sheath knives and mess gear and miscellaneous trade goods, including a lot of the empty wine and whisky bottles that had been hoarded for the past four years.</p>
			<p>At lunch, the talk was almost exclusively about the language problem. Lillian Ransby, who had not gotten to sleep before sunrise and had just gotten up, was discouraged.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what we’re going to do next,” she admitted. “Glenn Orent and Anna and I were on it all night, and we’re nowhere. We have about a hundred wordlike sounds isolated, and twenty or so are used repeatedly, and we can’t assign a meaning to any of them. And none of the Svants ever reacted the same way twice to anything we said to them. There’s just no one-to-one relationship anywhere.”</p>
			<p>“I’m beginning to doubt they have a language,” the Navy intelligence officer said. “Sure, they make a lot of vocal noise. So do chipmunks.”</p>
			<p>“They have to have a language,” Anna de Jong declared. “No sapient thought is possible without verbalization.”</p>
			<p>“Well, no society like that is possible without some means of communication,” Karl Dorver supported her from the other flank. He seemed to have made that point before. “You know,” he added, “I’m beginning to wonder if it mightn’t be telepathy.”</p>
			<p>He evidently hadn’t suggested that before. The others looked at him in surprise. Anna started to say, “Oh, I doubt if⁠—” and then stopped.</p>
			<p>“I know, the race of telepaths is an old gimmick that’s been used in new-planet adventure stories for centuries, but maybe we’ve finally found one.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t like it, Karl,” Loughran said. “If they’re telepaths, why don’t they understand us? And if they’re telepaths, why do they talk at all? And you can’t convince me that this boodly-oodly-doodle of theirs isn’t talking.”</p>
			<p>“Well, our neural structure and theirs won’t be nearly alike,” Fayon said. “I know, this analogy between telepathy and radio is full of holes, but it’s good enough for this. Our wave length can’t be picked up with their sets.”</p>
			<p>“The deuce it can’t,” Gofredo contradicted. “I’ve been bothered about that from the beginning. These people act as though they got meaning from us. Not the meaning we intend, but some meaning. When Paul made the gobbledygook speech, they all reacted in the same way⁠—frightened, and then defensive. The you-me routine simply bewildered them, as we’d be at a set of semantically lucid but self-contradictory statements. When Lillian tried to introduce herself, they were shocked and horrified.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“It looked to me like actual physical disgust,” Anna interpolated.</p>
			<p>“When I tried it, they acted like a lot of puppies being petted, and when Mark tried it, they were simply baffled. I watched Mark explaining that steel knives were dangerously sharp; they got the demonstration, but when he tried to tie words onto it, it threw them completely.”</p>
			<p>“<strong>All right</strong>. Pass that,” Loughran conceded. “But if they have telepathy, why do they use spoken words?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I can answer that,” Anna said. “Say they communicated by speech originally, and developed their telepathic faculty slowly and without realizing it. They’d go on using speech, and since the message would be received telepathically ahead of the spoken message, nobody would pay any attention to the words as such. Everybody would have a spoken language of his own; it would be sort of the instrumental accompaniment to the song.”</p>
			<p>“Some of them don’t bother speaking,” Karl nodded. “They just toot.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll buy that, right away,” Loughran agreed. “In mating, or in group-danger situations, telepathy would be a race-survival characteristic. It would be selected for genetically, and the non-gifted strains would tend to die out.”</p>
			<p>It wouldn’t do. It wouldn’t do at all. He said so.</p>
			<p>“Look at their technology. We either have a young race, just emerged from savagery, or an old, stagnant race. All indications seem to favor the latter. A young race would not have time to develop telepathy as Anna suggests. An old race would have gone much farther than these people have. Progress is a matter of communication and pooling ideas and discoveries. Make a trend-graph of technological progress on Terra; every big jump comes after an improvement in communications. The printing press; railways and steamships; the telegraph; radio. Then think how telepathy would speed up progress.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The sun was barely past noon meridian before the Svants, who had ventured down into the fields at sunrise, were returning to the mound-village. In the snooper-screen, they could be seen coming up in tunics and breechclouts, entering houses, and emerging in long robes. There seemed to be no bows or spears in evidence, but the big horn sounded occasionally. Paul Meillard was pleased. Even if it had been by sign-talk, which he rated with worm-fishing for trout or shooting sitting rabbits, he had gotten something across to them.</p>
			<p>When they went to the village, at 1500, they had trouble getting their lorry down. A couple of Marines in a jeep had to go in first to get the crowd out of the way. Several of the locals, including the one with the staff, joined with them; this quick cooperation delighted Meillard. When they had the lorry down and were all out of it, the dignitary with the staff, his scarlet tablecloth over his yellow robe, began an oration, apparently with every confidence that he was being understood. In spite of his objections at lunch, the telepathy theory was beginning to seem more persuasive.</p>
			<p>“Give them the Shooting of Dan McJabberwock again,” he told Meillard. “This is where we came in yesterday.”</p>
			<p>Something Meillard had noticed was exciting him. “Wait a moment. They’re going to do something.”</p>
			<p>They were indeed. The one with the staff and three of his henchmen advanced. The staff bearer touched himself on the brow. “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Fwoonk</i>,” he said. Then he pointed to Meillard. “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Hoonkle</i>,” he said.</p>
			<p>“They got it!” Lillian was hugging herself joyfully. “I knew they ought to!”</p>
			<p>Meillard indicated himself and said, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Fwoonk.</i>”</p>
			<p>That wasn’t right. The village elder immediately corrected him. The word, it seemed, was, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Fwoonk.</i>”</p>
			<p>His three companions agreed that that was the word for self, but that was as far as the agreement went. They rendered it, respectively, as “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Pwink</i>,” “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Tweelt</i>” and “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Kroosh</i>.”</p>
			<p>Gofredo gave a barking laugh. He was right; anything that could go wrong would go wrong. Lillian used a word; it was not a ladylike word at all. The Svants looked at them as though wondering what could possibly be the matter. Then they went into a huddle, arguing vehemently. The argument spread, like a ripple in a pool; soon everybody was twittering vocally or blowing on flutes and Panpipes. Then the big horn started blaring. Immediately, Gofredo snatched the handphone of his belt radio and began speaking urgently into it.</p>
			<p>“What are you doing, Luis?” Meillard asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Calling the reserve in. I’m not taking chances on this.” He spoke again into the phone, then called over his shoulder: “Rienet; three one-second bursts, in the air!”</p>
			<p>A Marine pointed a submachine gun skyward and ripped off a string of shots, then another, and another. There was silence after the first burst. Then a frightful howling arose.</p>
			<p>“Luis, you imbecile!” Meillard was shouting.</p>
			<p>Gofredo jumped onto the top of an airjeep, where they could all see him; drawing his pistol, he fired twice into the air.</p>
			<p>“Be quiet, all of you!” he shouted, as though that would do any good.</p>
			<p>It did. Silence fell, bounced noisily, and then settled over the crowd. Gofredo went on talking to them: “Take it easy, now; easy.” He might have been speaking to a frightened dog or a fractious horse. “Nobody’s going to hurt you. This is nothing but the great noise-magic of the Terrans.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Get the presents unloaded,” Meillard was saying. “Make a big show of it. The table first.”</p>
			<p>The horn, which had started, stopped blowing. As they were getting off the long table and piling it with trade goods, another lorry came in, disgorging twenty Marine riflemen. They had their bayonets fixed; the natives looked apprehensively at the bare steel, but went on listening to Gofredo. Meillard pulled the (Lord Mayor? Archbishop? Lord of the Manor?) aside, and began making sign-talk to him.</p>
			<p>When quiet was restored, Howell put a pick and shovel into a wheelbarrow and pushed them out into the space that had been cleared in front of the table. He swung the pick for a while, then shoveled the barrow full of ground. After pushing it around for a while, he dumped it back in the hole and leveled it off. Two Marines brought out an eight-inch log and chopped a couple of billets off it with an ax, then cut off another with one of the saws, split them up, and filled the wheelbarrow with the firewood.</p>
			<p>The knives, jewelry and other small items would be no problem; they had enough of them to go around. The other stuff would be harder to distribute, and Paul Meillard and Karl Dorver were arguing about how to handle it. If they weren’t careful, a lot of new bowie knives would get bloodied.</p>
			<p>“Have them form a queue,” Anna suggested. “That will give them the idea of equal sharing, and we’ll be able to learn something about their status levels and social hierarchy and agonistic relations.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The one with the staff took it as a matter of course that he would go first; his associates began falling in behind him, and the rest of the villagers behind them. Whether they’d gotten one the day before or not, everybody was given a knife and a bandanna and one piece of flashy junk-jewelry, also a stainless steel cup and mess plate, a bucket, and an empty bottle with a cork. The women didn’t carry sheath knives, so they got Boy Scout knives on lanyards. They were all lavishly supplied with Extee Three and candy. Any of the children who looked big enough to be trusted with them got knives too, and plenty of candy.</p>
			<p>Anna and Karl were standing where the queue was forming, watching how they fell into line; so was Lillian, with an audiovisual camera. Having seen that the Marine enlisted men were getting the presents handed out properly, Howell strolled over to them. Just as he came up, a couple approached hesitantly, a man in a breechclout under a leather apron, and a woman, much smaller, in a ragged and soiled tunic. As soon as they fell into line, another Svant, in a blue robe, pushed them aside and took their place.</p>
			<p>“Here, you can’t do that!” Lillian cried. “Karl, make him step back.”</p>
			<p>Karl was saying something about social status and precedence. The couple tried to get into line behind the man who had pushed them aside. Another villager tried to shove them out of his way. Howell advanced, his right fist closing. Then he remembered that he didn’t know what he’d be punching; he might break the fellow’s neck, or his own knuckles. He grabbed the blue-robed Svant by the wrist with both hands, kicked a foot out from under him, and jerked, sending him flying for six feet and then sliding in the dust for another couple of yards. He pushed the others back, and put the couple into place in the line.</p>
			<p>“Mark, you shouldn’t have done that,” Dorver was expostulating. “We don’t know.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>The Svant sat up, shaking his head groggily. Then he realized what had been done to him. With a snarl of rage, he was on his feet, his knife in his hand. It was a Terran bowie knife. Without conscious volition, Howell’s pistol was out and he was thumbing the safety off.</p>
			<p>The Svant stopped short, then dropped the knife, ducked his head, and threw his arms over it to shield his comb. He backed away a few steps, then turned and bolted into the nearest house. The others, including the woman in the ragged tunic, were twittering in alarm. Only the man in the leather apron was calm; he was saying, tonelessly, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Ghrooogh-ghrooogh.</i>”</p>
			<p>Luis Gofredo was coming up on the double, followed by three of his riflemen.</p>
			<p>“What happened, Mark? Trouble?”</p>
			<p>“All over now.” He told Gofredo what had happened. Dorver was still objecting:</p>
			<p>“… Social precedence; the Svant may have been right, according to local customs.”</p>
			<p>“Local customs be damned!” Gofredo became angry. “This is a Terran Federation handout; we make the rules, and one of them is, no pushing people out of line. Teach the buggers that now and we won’t have to work so hard at it later.” He called back over his shoulder, “Situation under control; get the show going again.”</p>
			<p>The natives were all grimacing heartbrokenly with pleasure. Maybe the one who got thrown on his ear⁠—no, he didn’t have any⁠—was not one of the more popular characters in the village.</p>
			<p>“You just pulled your gun, and he dropped the knife and ran?” Gofredo asked. “And the others were scared, too?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. They all saw you fire yours; the noise scared them.”</p>
			<p>Gofredo nodded. “We’ll avoid promiscuous shooting, then. No use letting them find out the noise won’t hurt them any sooner than we have to.”</p>
			<p>Paul Meillard had worked out a way to distribute the picks and shovels and axes. Considering each house as representing a family unit, which might or might not be the case, there were picks and shovels enough to go around, and an ax for every third house. They took them around in an airjeep and left them at the doors. The houses, he found, weren’t adobe at all. They were built of logs, plastered with adobe on the outside. That demolished his theory that the houses were torn down periodically, and left the mound itself unexplained.</p>
			<p>The wheelbarrows and the grindstone and the two crosscut saws were another matter. Nobody was quite sure that the (nobility? capitalist-class? politicians? prominent citizens?) wouldn’t simply appropriate them for themselves. Paul Meillard was worried about that; everybody else was willing to let matters take their course. Before they were off the ground in their vehicles, a violent dispute had begun, with a bedlam of jabbering and shrieking. By the time they were landing at the camp, the big laminated leather horn had begun to bellow.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>One of the huts had been fitted as contact-team headquarters, with all the view and communication screens installed, and one end partitioned off and soundproofed for Lillian to study recordings in. It was cocktail time when they returned; conversationally, it was a continuation from lunch. Karl Dorver was even more convinced than ever of his telepathic hypothesis, and he had completely converted Anna de Jong to it.</p>
			<p>“Look at that.” He pointed at the snooper screen, which gave a view of the plaza from directly above. “They’re reaching an agreement already.”</p>
			<p>So they seemed to be, though upon what was less apparent. The horn had stopped, and the noise was diminishing. The odd thing was that peace was being restored, or was restoring itself, as the uproar had begun⁠—outwardly from the center of the plaza to the periphery of the crowd. The same thing had happened when Gofredo had ordered the submachine gun fired, and, now that he recalled, when he had dealt with the line-crasher.</p>
			<p>“Suppose a few of them, in the middle, are agreed,” Anna said. “They are all thinking in unison, combining their telepathic powers. They dominate those nearest to them, who join and amplify their telepathic signal, and it spreads out through the whole group. A mental chain-reaction.”</p>
			<p>“That would explain the mechanism of community leadership, and I’d been wondering about that,” Dorver said, becoming more excited. “It’s a mental aristocracy; an especially gifted group of telepaths, in agreement and using their powers in concert, implanting their opinions in the minds of all the others. I’ll bet the purpose of the horn is to distract the thoughts of the others, so that they can be more easily dominated. And the noise of the shots shocked them out of communication with each other; no wonder they were frightened.”</p>
			<p>Bennet Fayon was far from convinced. “So far, this telepathy theory is only an assumption. I find it a lot easier to assume some fundamental difference between the way they translate sound into sense-data and the way we do. We <em>think</em> those combs on top of their heads are their external hearing organs, but we have no idea what’s back of them, or what kind of a neural hookup is connected to them. I wish I knew how these people dispose of their dead. I need a couple of fresh cadavers. Too bad they aren’t warlike. Nothing like a good bloody battle to advance the science of anatomy, and what we don’t know about Svant anatomy is practically the entire subject.”</p>
			<p>“I should imagine the animals hear in the same way,” Meillard said. “When the wagon wheels and the hoes and the blacksmith tools come down from the ship, we’ll trade for cattle.”</p>
			<p>“When they make the second landing in the mountains, I’m going to do a lot of hunting,” Loughran added. “I’ll get wild animals for you.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m going to assume that the vocal noises they make are meaningful speech,” Lillian Ransby said. “So far, I’ve just been trying to analyze them for phonetic values. Now I’m going to analyze them for sound-wave patterns. No matter what goes on inside their private nervous systems, the sounds exist as waves in the public atmosphere. I’m going to assume that the Lord Mayor and his stooges were all trying to say the same thing when they were pointing to themselves, and I’m going to see if all four of those sounds have any common characteristic.”</p>
			<p>By the time dinner was over, they were all talking in circles, none of them hopefully. They all made recordings of the speech about the slithy toves in the Malemute Saloon; Lillian wanted to find out what was different about them. Luis Gofredo saw to it that the camp itself would be visible-lighted, and beyond the lights he set up more photoelectric robot sentries and put a couple of snoopers to circling on contragravity, with infrared lights and receptors. He also insisted that all his own men and all Dave Questell’s Navy construction engineers keep their weapons ready to hand. The natives in the village were equally distrustful. They didn’t herd the cattle up from the meadows where they had been pastured, but they lighted watch-fires along the edge of the mound as soon as it became dark.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was three hours after nightfall when something on the indicator-board for the robot sentries went off like a startled rattlesnake. Everybody, talking idly or concentrating on writing up the day’s observations, stiffened. Luis Gofredo, dozing in a chair, was on his feet instantly and crossing the hut to the instruments. His second-in-command, who had been playing chess with Willi Schallenmacher, rose and snatched his belt from the back of his chair, putting it on.</p>
			<p>“Take it easy,” Gofredo said. “Probably just a cow or a horse⁠—local equivalent⁠—that’s strayed over from the other side.”</p>
			<p>He sat down in front of one of the snooper screens and twisted knobs on the remote controls. The monochrome view, transformed from infra red, rotated as the snooper circled and changed course. The other screen showed the camp receding and the area around it widening as its snooper gained altitude.</p>
			<p>“It’s not a big party,” Gofredo was saying. “I can’t see⁠—Oh, yes I can. Only two of them.”</p>
			<p>The humanoid figures, one larger than the other, were moving cautiously across the fields, crouching low. The snooper went down toward them, and then he recognized them. The man and woman whom the blue-robed villager had tried to shove out of the queue, that afternoon. Gofredo recognized them, too.</p>
			<p>“Your friends, Mark. Harry,” he told his subordinate, “go out and pass the word around. Only two, and we think they’re friendly. Keep everybody out of sight; we don’t want to scare them away.”</p>
			<p>The snooper followed closely behind them. The man was no longer wearing his apron; the woman’s tunic was even more tattered and soiled. She was leading him by the hand. Now and then, she would stop and turn her head to the rear. The snooper over the mound showed nothing but half a dozen fire-watchers dozing by their fires. Then the pair were at the edge of the camp lights. As they advanced, they seemed to realize that they had passed a point-of-no-return. They straightened and came forward steadily, the woman seeming to be guiding her companion.</p>
			<p>“What’s happening, Mark?”</p>
			<p>It was Lillian; she must have just come out of the soundproof speech-lab.</p>
			<p>“You know them; the pair in the queue, this afternoon. I think we’ve annexed a couple of friendly natives.”</p>
			<p>They all went outside. The two natives, having come into the camp, had stopped. For a moment, the man in the breechclout seemed undecided whether he was more afraid to turn and run than advance. The woman, holding his hand, led him forward. They were both bruised, and both had minor cuts, and neither of them had any of the things that had been given to them that afternoon.</p>
			<p>“Rest of the gang beat them up and robbed them,” Gofredo began angrily.</p>
			<p>“See what you did?” Dorver began. “According to their own customs, they had no right to be ahead of those others, and now you’ve gotten them punished for it.”</p>
			<p>“I’d have done more to that fellow then Mark did, if I’d been there when it happened.” The Marine officer turned to Meillard. “Look, this is your show, Paul; how you run it is your job. But in your place, I’d take that pair back to the village and have them point out who beat them up, and teach the whole gang of them a lesson. If you’re going to colonize this planet, you’re going to have to establish Federation law, and Federation law says you mustn’t gang up on people and beat and rob them. We don’t have to speak Svantese to make them understand what we’ll put up with and what we won’t.”</p>
			<p>“Later, Luis. After we’ve gotten a treaty with somebody.” Meillard broke off. “Watch this!”</p>
			<p>The woman was making sign-talk. She pointed to the village on the mound. Then, with her hands, she shaped a bucket like the ones that had been given to them, and made a snatching gesture away from herself. She indicated the neckcloths, and the sheath knife and the other things, and snatched them away too. She made beating motions, and touched her bruises and the man’s. All the time, she was talking excitedly, in a high, shrill voice. The man made the same <i xml:lang="x-svanto">ghroogh-ghroogh</i> noises that he had that afternoon.</p>
			<p>“No; we can’t take any punitive action. Not now,” Meillard said. “But we’ll have to do something for them.”</p>
			<p>Vengeance, it seemed, wasn’t what they wanted. The woman made vehement gestures of rejection toward the village, then bowed, placing her hands on her brow. The man imitated her obeisance, then they both straightened. The woman pointed to herself and to the man, and around the circle of huts and landing craft. She began scuttling about, picking up imaginary litter and sweeping with an imaginary broom. The man started pounding with an imaginary hammer, then chopping with an imaginary ax.</p>
			<p>Lillian was clapping her hands softly. “Good; got it the first time. ‘You let us stay; we work for you.’ How about it, Paul?”</p>
			<p>Meillard nodded. “Punitive action’s unadvisable, but we will show our attitude by taking them in. You tell them, Luis; these people seem to like your voice.”</p>
			<p>Gofredo put a hand on each of their shoulders. “You⁠ ⁠… stay⁠ ⁠… with us.” He pointed around the camp. “You⁠ ⁠… stay⁠ ⁠… this⁠ ⁠… place.”</p>
			<p>Their faces broke into that funny just-before-tears expression that meant happiness with them. The man confined his vocal expressions to his odd <i xml:lang="x-svanto">ghroogh-ghroogh</i>-ing; the woman twittered joyfully. Gofredo put a hand on the woman’s shoulder, pointed to the man and from him back to her. “Unh?” he inquired.</p>
			<p>The woman put a hand on the man’s head, then brought it down to within a foot of the ground. She picked up the imaginary infant and rocked it in her arms, then set it down and grew it up until she had her hand on the top of the man’s head again.</p>
			<p>“That was good, Mom,” Gofredo told her. “Now, you and Sonny come along; we’ll issue you equipment and find you billets.” He added, “What in blazes are we going to feed them; Extee Three?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They gave them replacements for all the things that had been taken away from them. They gave the man a one-piece suit of Marine combat coveralls; Lillian gave the woman a lavender bathrobe, and Anna contributed a red scarf. They found them quarters in one end of a store shed, after making sure that there was nothing they could get at that would hurt them or that they could damage. They gave each of them a pair of blankets and a pneumatic mattress, which delighted them, although the cots puzzled them at first.</p>
			<p>“What do you think about feeding them, Bennet?” Meillard asked, when the two Svants had gone to bed and they were back in the headquarters hut. “You said the food on this planet is safe for Terrans.”</p>
			<p>“So I did, and it is, but the rule’s not reversible. Things we eat might kill them,” Fayon said. “Meats will be especially dangerous. And no caffeine, and no alcohol.”</p>
			<p>“Alcohol won’t hurt them,” Schallenmacher said. “I saw big jars full of fermenting fruit-mash back of some of those houses; in about a year, it ought to be fairly good wine. C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH is the same on any planet.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we’ll get native foodstuffs tomorrow,” Meillard said. “We’ll have to do that by signs, too,” he regretted.</p>
			<p>“Get Mom to help you; she’s pretty sharp,” Lillian advised. “But I think Sonny’s the village half-wit.”</p>
			<p>Anna de Jong agreed. “Even if we don’t understand Svant psychology, that’s evident; he’s definitely subnormal. The way he clings to his mother for guidance is absolutely pathetic. He’s a mature adult, but mentally he’s still a little child.”</p>
			<p>“That may explain it!” Dorver cried. “A mental defective, in a community of telepaths, constantly invading the minds of others with irrational and disgusting thoughts; no wonder he is rejected and persecuted. And in a community on this culture level, the mother of an abnormal child is often regarded with superstitious detestation⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course!” Anna de Jong instantly agreed, and began to go into the villagers’ hostility to both mother and son; both of them were now taking the telepathy hypothesis for granted.</p>
			<p>Well, maybe so. He turned to Lillian.</p>
			<p>“What did you find out?”</p>
			<p>“Well, there is a common characteristic in all four sounds. A little patch on the screen at seventeen-twenty cycles. The odd thing is that when I try to repeat the sound, it isn’t there.”</p>
			<p>Odd indeed. If a Svant said something, he made sound waves; if she imitated the sound, she ought to imitate the wave pattern. He said so, and she agreed.</p>
			<p>“But come back here and look at this,” she invited.</p>
			<p>She had been using a visibilizing analyzer; in it, a sound was broken by a set of filters into frequency-groups, translated into light from dull red to violet paling into pure white. It photographed the light-pattern on high-speed film, automatically developed it, and then made a print-copy and projected the film in slow motion on a screen. When she pressed a button, a recorded voice said, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Fwoonk.</i>” An instant later, a pattern of vertical lines in various colors and lengths was projected on the screen.</p>
			<p>“Those green lines,” she said. “That’s it. Now, watch this.”</p>
			<p>She pressed another button, got the photoprint out of a slot, and propped it beside the screen. Then she picked up a handphone and said, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Fwoonk</i>,” into it. It sounded like the first one, but the pattern that danced onto the screen was quite different. Where the green had been, there was a patch of pale-blue lines. She ran the other three Svants’ voices, each saying, presumably, “Me.” Some were mainly up in blue, others had a good deal of yellow and orange, but they all had the little patch of green lines.</p>
			<p>“Well, that seems to be the information,” he said. “The rest is just noise.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe one of them is saying, ‘John Doe, <em>me</em>, son of Joe Blow,’ and another is saying, ‘Tough guy, <em>me</em>; lick anybody in town.’ ”</p>
			<p>“All in one syllable?” Then he shrugged. How did he know what these people could pack into one syllable? He picked up the handphone and said, “Fwoonk,” into it. The pattern, a little deeper in color and with longer lines, was recognizably like hers, and unlike any of the Svants.’</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The others came in, singly and in pairs and threes. They watched the colors dance on the screen to picture the four Svant words which might or might not all mean <em>me</em>. They tried to duplicate them. Luis Gofredo and Willi Schallenmacher came closest of anybody. Bennet Fayon was still insisting that the Svants had a perfectly comprehensible language⁠—to other Svants. Anna de Jong had started to veer a little away from the Dorver Hypothesis. There was a difference between event-level sound, which was a series of waves of alternately crowded and rarefied molecules of air, and object-level sound, which was an auditory sensation inside the nervous system, she admitted. That, Fayon crowed, was what he’d been saying all along; their auditory system was probably such that <i xml:lang="x-svanto">fwoonk</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">pwink</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">tweelt</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">kroosh</i> all sounded alike to them.</p>
			<p>By this time, <i xml:lang="x-svanto">fwoonk</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">pwink</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">tweelt</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">kroosh</i> had become swear words among the joint Space Navy-Colonial Office contact team.</p>
			<p>“Well, if I hear the two sounds alike, why doesn’t the analyzer hear them alike?” Karl Dorver demanded.</p>
			<p>“It has better ears than you do, Karl. Look how many different frequencies there are in that word, all crowding up behind each other,” Lillian said. “But it isn’t sensitive or selective enough. I’m going to see what Ayesha Keithley can do about building me a better one.”</p>
			<p>Ayesha was signals and detection officer on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hubert Penrose</i>. Dave Questell mentioned that she’d had a hard day, and was probably making sack-time, and she wouldn’t welcome being called at 0130. Nobody seemed to have realized that it had gotten that late.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’ll call the ship and have a recording made for her for when she gets up. But till we get something that’ll sort this mess out and make sense of it, I’m stopped.”</p>
			<p>“You’re stopped, period, Lillian,” Dorver told her. “What these people gibber at us doesn’t even make as much sense as the Shooting of Dan McJabberwock. The real information is conveyed by telepathy.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Lieutenant <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">j.g.</abbr> Ayesha Keithley was on the screen the next morning while they were eating breakfast. She was a blonde, like Lillian.</p>
			<p>“I got your message; you seem to have problems, don’t you?”</p>
			<p>“Speaking conservatively, yes. You see what we’re up against?”</p>
			<p>“You don’t know what their vocal organs are like, do you?” the girl in naval uniform in the screen asked.</p>
			<p>Lillian shook her head. “Bennet Fayon’s hoping for a war, or an epidemic, or something to break out, so that he can get a few cadavers to dissect.”</p>
			<p>“Well, he’ll find that they’re pretty complex,” Ayesha Keithley said. “I identified stick-and-slip sounds and percussion sounds, and plucked-string sounds, along with the ordinary hiss-and-buzz speech-sounds. Making a vocoder to reproduce that speech is going to be fun. Just what are you using, in the way of equipment?”</p>
			<p>Lillian was still talking about that when the two landing craft from the ship were sighted, coming down. Charley Loughran and Willi Schallenmacher, who were returning to the <em>Hubert Penrose</em> to join the other landing party, began assembling their luggage. The others went outside, Howell among them.</p>
			<p>Mom and Sonny were watching the two craft grow larger and closer above, keeping close to a group of spacemen; Sonny was looking around excitedly, while Mom clung to his arm, like a hen with an oversized chick. The reasoning was clear⁠—these people knew all about big things that came down out of the sky and weren’t afraid of them; stick close to them, and it would be perfectly safe. Sonny saw the contact team emerging from their hut and grabbed his mother’s arm, pointing. They both beamed happily; that expression didn’t look sad, at all, now that you knew what it meant. Sonny began ghroogh-ghrooghing hideously; Mom hushed him with a hand over his mouth, and they both made eating gestures, rubbed their abdomens comfortably, and pointed toward the mess hut. Bennet Fayon was frightened. He turned and started on the double toward the cook, who was standing in the doorway of the hut, calling out to him.</p>
			<p>The cook spoke inaudibly. Fayon stopped short. “Unholy Saint Beelzebub, no!” he cried. The cook said something in reply, shrugging. Fayon came back, talking to himself.</p>
			<p>“Terran carniculture pork,” he said, when he returned. “Zarathustra pool-ball fruit. Potato-flour hotcakes, with Baldur honey and Odin flameberry jam. And two big cups of coffee apiece. It’s a miracle they aren’t dead now. If they’re alive for lunch, we won’t need to worry about feeding them anything we eat, but I’m glad somebody else has the moral responsibility for this.”</p>
			<p>Lillian Ransby came out of the headquarters hut. “Ayesha’s coming down this afternoon, with a lot of equipment,” she said. “We’re not exactly going to count air molecules in the sound waves, but we’ll do everything short of that. We’ll need more lab space, soundproofed.”</p>
			<p>“Tell Dave Questell what you want,” Meillard said. “Do you really think you can get anything?”</p>
			<p>She shrugged. “If there’s anything there to get. How long it’ll take is another question.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The two sixty-foot collapsium-armored turtles settled to the ground and went off contragravity. The ports opened, and things began being floated off on lifter-skids: framework for the water tower, and curved titanium sheets for the tank. Anna de Jong said something about hot showers, and not having to take any more sponge-baths. Howell was watching the stuff come off the other landing craft. A dozen pairs of four-foot wagon wheels, with axles. Hoes, in bundles. Scythe blades. A hand forge, with a crank-driven fan blower, and a hundred and fifty pound anvil, and sledges and cutters and swages and tongs.</p>
			<p>Everybody was busy, and Mom and Sonny were fidgeting, gesturing toward the work with their own empty hands. <q>Hey, boss; whatta we gonna do?</q> He patted them on the shoulders.</p>
			<p>“Take it easy.” He hoped his tone would convey nonurgency. “We’ll find something for you to do.”</p>
			<p>He wasn’t particularly happy about most of what was coming off. Giving these Svants tools was fine, but it was more important to give them technologies. The people on the ship hadn’t thought of that. These wheels, now; machined steel hubs, steel rims, tubular steel spokes, drop-forged and machined axles. The Svants wouldn’t be able to copy them in a thousand years. Well, in a hundred, if somebody showed them where and how to mine iron and how to smelt and work it. And how to build a steam engine.</p>
			<p>He went over and pulled a hoe out of one of the bundles. Blades stamped out with a power press, welded to tubular steel handles. Well, wood for hoe handles was hard to come by on a spaceship, even a battle cruiser almost half a mile in diameter; he had to admit that. And they were about two thousand percent more efficient than the bronze scrapers the Svants used. That wasn’t the idea, though. Even supposing that the first wave of colonists came out in a year and a half, it would be close to twenty years before Terran-operated factories would be in mass production for the native trade. The idea was to teach these people to make better things for themselves; give them a leg up, so that the next generation would be ready for contragravity and nuclear and electric power.</p>
			<p>Mom didn’t know what to make of any of it. Sonny did, though; he was excited, grabbing Howell’s arm, pointing, saying, “<i xml:lang="x-svanto">Ghroogh!</i> <i xml:lang="x-svanto">Ghroogh!</i>” He pointed at the wheels, and then made a stooping, lifting and pushing gesture. <q>Like wheelbarrow?</q></p>
			<p>“That’s right.” He nodded, wondering if Sonny recognized that as an affirmative sign. “Like big wheelbarrow.”</p>
			<p>One thing puzzled Sonny, though. Wheelbarrow wheels were small⁠—his hands indicated the size⁠—and single. These were big, and double.</p>
			<p>“Let me show you this, Sonny.”</p>
			<p>He squatted, took a pad and pencil from his pocket, and drew two pairs of wheels, and then put a wagon on them, and drew a quadruped hitched to it, and a Svant with a stick walking beside it. Sonny looked at the picture⁠—Svants seemed to have pictoral sense, for which make us thankful!⁠—and then caught his mother’s sleeve and showed it to her. Mom didn’t get it. Sonny took the pencil and drew another animal, with a pole travois. He made gestures. A travois dragged; it went slow. A wagon had wheels that went around; it went fast.</p>
			<p>So Lillian and Anna thought he was the village half-wit. Village genius, more likely; the other peasants didn’t understand him, and resented his superiority. They went over for a closer look at the wheels, and pushed them. Sonny was almost beside himself. Mom was puzzled, but she thought they were pretty wonderful.</p>
			<p>Then they looked at blacksmith tools. Tongs; Sonny had never seen anything like them. Howell wondered what the Svants used to handle hot metal; probably big tweezers made by tying two green sticks together. There was an old Arabian legend that Allah had made the first tongs and given them to the first smith, because nobody could make tongs without having a pair already.</p>
			<p>Sonny didn’t understand the fan-blower until it was taken apart. Then he made a great discovery. The wheels, and the fan, and the pivoted tongs, all embodied the same principle, one his people had evidently never discovered. A whole new world seemed to open before him; from then on, he was constantly finding things pierced and rotating on pivots.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>By this time, Mom was fidgeting again. She ought to be doing something to justify her presence in the camp. He was wondering what sort of work he could invent for her when Karl Dorver called to him from the door of the headquarters hut.</p>
			<p>“Mark, can you spare Mom for a while?” he asked. “We want her to look at pictures and show us which of the animals are meat-cattle, and which of the crops are ripe.”</p>
			<p>“Think you can get anything out of her?”</p>
			<p>“Sign-talk, yes. We may get a few words from her, too.”</p>
			<p>At first, Mom was unwilling to leave Sonny. She finally decided that it would be safe, and trotted over to Dorver, entering the hut.</p>
			<p>Dave Questell’s construction crew began at once on the water tank, using a power shovel to dig the foundation. They had to haul water in a tank from the river a quarter-mile away to mix the concrete. Sonny watched that interestedly. So did a number of the villagers, who gathered safely out of bowshot. They noticed Sonny among the Terrans and pointed at him. Sonny noticed that. He unobtrusively picked up a double-bitted ax and kept it to hand.</p>
			<p>He and Mom had lunch with the contact team. As they showed no ill effects from breakfast, Fayon decided that it was safe to let them have anything the Terrans ate or drank. They liked wine; they knew what it was, all right, but this seemed to have a delightfully different flavor. They each tried a cigarette, choked over the first few puffs, and decided that they didn’t like smoking.</p>
			<p>“Mom gave us a lot of information, as far as she could, on the crops and animals. The big things, the size of rhinoceroses, are draft animals and nothing else; they’re not eaten,” Dorver said. “I don’t know whether the meat isn’t good, or is taboo, or they are too valuable to eat. They eat all the other three species, and milk two of them. I have an idea they grind their grain in big stone mortars as needed.”</p>
			<p>That was right; he’d seen things like that.</p>
			<p>“Willi, when you’re over in the mountains, see if you can find something we can make millstones out of. We can shape them with sono-cutters; after they get the idea, they can do it themselves by hand. One of those big animals could be used to turn the mill. Did you get any words from her?”</p>
			<p>Paul Meillard shook his head gloomily. “Nothing we can be sure of. It was the same thing as in the village, yesterday. She’d say something, I’d repeat it, and she’d tell us it was wrong and say the same thing over again. Lillian took recordings; she got the same results as last night. Ask her about it later.”</p>
			<p>“She has the same effect on Mom as on the others?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. Mom was very polite and tried not to show it, but⁠—”</p>
			<p>Lillian took him aside, out of earshot of the two Svants, after lunch. She was almost distracted.</p>
			<p>“Mark, I don’t know what I’m going to do. She’s like the others. Every time I open my mouth in front of her, she’s simply horrified. It’s as though my voice does something loathsome to her. And I’m the one who’s supposed to learn to talk to them.”</p>
			<p>“Well, those who can do, and those who can’t teach,” he told her. “You can study recordings, and tell us what the words are and teach us how to recognize and pronounce them. You’re the only linguist we have.”</p>
			<p>That seemed to comfort her a little. He hoped it would work out that way. If they could communicate with these people and did leave a party here to prepare for the first colonization, he’d stay on, to teach the natives Terran technologies and study theirs. He’d been expecting that Lillian would stay, too. She was the linguist; she’d have to stay. But now, if it turned out that she would be no help but a liability, she’d go back with the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hubert Penrose</i>. Paul wouldn’t keep a linguist who offended the natives’ every sensibility with every word she spoke. He didn’t want that to happen. Lillian and he had come to mean a little too much to each other to be parted now.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Paul Meillard and Karl Dorver had considerable difficulty with Mom, that afternoon. They wanted her to go with them and help trade for cattle. Mom didn’t want to; she was afraid. They had to do a lot of playacting, with half a dozen Marines pretending to guard her with fixed bayonets from some of Dave Questell’s Navy construction men who had red bandannas on their heads to simulate combs before she got the idea. Then she was afraid to get into the contragravity lorry that was to carry the hoes and the wagon wheels. Sonny managed to reassure her, and insisted on going along, and he insisted on taking his ax with him. That meant doubling the guard, to make sure Sonny didn’t lose his self-control when he saw his former persecutors within chopping distance.</p>
			<p>It went off much better than either Paul Meillard or Luis Gofredo expected. After the first shock of being airborne had worn off, Mom found that she liked contragravity-riding; Sonny was wildly delighted with it from the start. The natives showed neither of them any hostility. Mom’s lavender bathrobe and Sonny’s green coveralls and big ax seemed to be symbols of a new and exalted status; even the Lord Mayor was extremely polite to them.</p>
			<p>The Lord Mayor and half a dozen others got a contragravity ride, too, to the meadows to pick out cattle. A dozen animals, including a pair of the two-ton draft beasts, were driven to the Terran camp. A couple of lorry-loads of assorted vegetables were brought in, too. Everybody seemed very happy about the deal, especially Bennet Fayon. He wanted to slaughter one of the sheep-sized meat-and-milk animals at once and get to work on it. Gofredo advised him to put it off till the next morning. He wanted a large native audience to see the animal being shot with a rifle.</p>
			<p>The water tower was finished, and the big spherical tank hoisted on top of it and made fast. A pump, and a filter-system were installed. There was no water for hot showers that evening, though. They would have to run a pipeline to the river, and that would entail a ditch that would cut through several cultivated fields, which, in turn, would provoke an uproar. Paul Meillard didn’t want that happening until he’d concluded the cattle-trade.</p>
			<p>Charley Loughran and Willi Schallenmacher had gone up to the ship on one of the landing craft; they accompanied the landing party that went down into the mountains. Ayesha Keithley arrived late in the afternoon on another landing craft, with five or six tons of instruments and parts and equipment, and a male Navy warrant-officer helper.</p>
			<p>They looked around the lab Lillian had been using at one end of the headquarters hut.</p>
			<p>“This won’t do,” the girl Navy officer said. “We can’t get a quarter of the apparatus we’re going to need in here. We’ll have to build something.”</p>
			<p>Dave Questell was drawn into the discussion. Yes, he could put up something big enough for everything the girls would need to install, and soundproof it. Concrete, he decided; they’d have to wait till he got the water line down and the pump going, though.</p>
			<p>There was a crowd of natives in the fields, gaping at the Terran camp, the next morning, and Gofredo decided to kill the animal⁠—until they learned the native name, they were calling it Domesticated Type C. It was herded out where everyone could watch, and a Marine stepped forward unslung his rifle took a kneeling position, and aimed at it. It was a hundred and fifty yards away. Mom had come out to see what was going on; Sonny and Howell, who had been consulting by signs over the construction of a wagon, were standing side by side. The Marine squeezed his trigger. The rifle banged, and the Domesticated-C bounded into the air, dropped, and kicked a few times and was still. The natives, however, missed that part of it; they were howling piteously and rubbing their heads. All but Sonny. He was just mildly surprised at what had happened to the <abbr>Dom.</abbr>-C.</p>
			<p>Sonny, it would appear, was stone deaf.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>As anticipated, there was another uproar later in the morning when the ditching machine started north across the meadow. A mob of Svants, seeing its relentless progress toward a field of something like turnips, gathered in front of it, twittering and brandishing implements of agriculture, many of them Terran-made.</p>
			<p>Paul Meillard was ready for this. Two lorries went out; one loaded with Marines, who jumped off with their rifles ready. By this time, all the Svants knew what rifles would do beside make a noise. Meillard, Dorver, Gofredo and a few others got out of the other vehicle, and unloaded presents. Gofredo did all the talking. The Svants couldn’t understand him, but they liked it. They also liked the presents, which included a dozen empty half-gallon rum demijohns, tarpaulins, and a lot of assorted knickknacks. The pipeline went through.</p>
			<p>He and Sonny got the forge set up. There was no fuel for it. A party of Marines had gone out to the woods to the east to cut wood; when they got back, they’d burn some charcoal in the pit that had been dug beside the camp. Until then, he and Sonny were drawing plans for a wooden wheel with a metal tire when Lillian came out of the headquarters hut with a clipboard under her arm. She motioned to him.</p>
			<p>“Come on over,” he told her. “You can talk in front of Sonny; he won’t mind. He can’t hear.”</p>
			<p>“Can’t hear?” she echoed. “You mean⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. Sonny’s stone deaf. He didn’t even hear that rifle going off. The only one of this gang that has brains enough to pour sand out of a boot with directions on the bottom of the heel, and he’s a total linguistic loss.”</p>
			<p>“So he isn’t a half-wit, after all.”</p>
			<p>“He’s got an <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.Q.</abbr> close to genius level. Look at this; he never saw a wheel before yesterday; now he’s designing one.”</p>
			<p>Lillian’s eyes widened. “So that’s why Mom’s so sharp about sign-talk. She’s been doing it all his life.” Then she remembered what she had come out to show him, and held out the clipboard. “You know how that analyzer of mine works? Well, here’s what Ayesha’s going to do. After breaking a sound into frequency bands instead of being photographed and projected, each band goes to an analyzer of its own, and is projected on its own screen. There’ll be forty of them, each for a band of a hundred cycles, from zero to four thousand. That seems to be the Svant vocal range.”</p>
			<p>The diagram passed from hand to hand during cocktail time, before dinner. Bennet Fayon had been working all day dissecting the animal they were all calling a <em>domsee</em>, a name which would stick even if and when they learned the native name. He glanced disinterestedly at the drawing, then looked again, more closely. Then he set down the drink he was holding in his other hand and studied it intently.</p>
			<p>“You know what you have here?” he asked. “This is a very close analogy to the hearing organs of that animal I was working on. The comb, as we’ve assumed, is the external organ. It’s covered with small flaps and fissures. Back of each fissure is a long, narrow membrane; they’re paired, one on each side of the comb, and from them nerves lead to clusters of small round membranes. Nerves lead from them to a complex nerve-cable at the bottom of the comb and into the brain at the base of the skull. I couldn’t understand how the system functioned, but now I see it. Each of the larger membranes on the outside responds to a sound-frequency band, and the small ones on the inside break the bands down to individual frequencies.”</p>
			<p>“How many of the little ones are there?” Ayesha asked.</p>
			<p>“Thousands of them; the inner comb is simply packed with them. Wait; I’ll show you.”</p>
			<p>He rose and went away, returning with a sheaf of photo-enlargements and a number of blocks of lucite in which specimens were mounted. Everybody examined them. Anna de Jong, as a practicing psychologist, had an <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.D.</abbr> and to get that she’d had to know a modicum of anatomy; she was puzzled.</p>
			<p>“I can’t understand how they hear with those things. I’ll grant that the membranes will respond to sound, but I can’t see how they transmit it.”</p>
			<p>“But they do hear,” Meillard said. “Their musical instruments, their reactions to our voices, the way they are affected by sounds like gunfire⁠—”</p>
			<p>“They hear, but they don’t hear in the same way we do,” Fayon replied. “If you can’t be convinced by anything else, look at these things, and compare them with the structure of the human ear, or the ear of any member of any other sapient race we’re ever contacted. That’s what I’ve been saying from the beginning.”</p>
			<p>“They have sound-perception to an extent that makes ours look almost like deafness,” Ayesha Keithley said. “I wish I could design a sound-detector one-tenth as good as this must be.”</p>
			<p>Yes. The way the Lord Mayor said <i xml:lang="x-svanto">fwoonk</i> and the way Paul Meillard said it sounded entirely different to them. Of course, <i xml:lang="x-svanto">fwoonk</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">pwink</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">tweelt</i> and <i xml:lang="x-svanto">kroosh</i> sounded alike to them, but let’s don’t be too picky about things.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were no hot showers that evening; Dave Questell’s gang had trouble with the pump and needed some new parts made up aboard the ship. They were still working on it the next morning. He had meant to start teaching Sonny blacksmithing, but during the evening Lillian and Anna had decided to try teaching Mom a nonphonetic, ideographic, alphabet, and in the morning they co-opted Sonny to help. Deprived of his disciple, he strolled over to watch the work on the pump. About twenty Svants had come in from the fields and were also watching, from the meadow.</p>
			<p>After a while, the job was finished. The petty officer in charge of the work pushed in the switch, and the pump started, sucking dry with a harsh racket. The natives twittered in surprise. Then the water came, and the pump settled down to a steady <i>thugg-thugg, thugg-thugg</i>.</p>
			<p>The Svants seemed to like the new sound; they grimaced in pleasure and moved closer; within forty or fifty feet, they all squatted on the ground and sat entranced. Others came in from the fields, drawn by the sound. They, too, came up and squatted, until there was a semicircle of them. The tank took a long time to fill; until it did, they all sat immobile and fascinated. Even after it stopped, many remained, hoping that it would start again. Paul Meillard began wondering, a trifle uneasily, if that would happen every time the pump went on.</p>
			<p>“They get a positive pleasure from it. It affects them the same way Luis’ voice does.”</p>
			<p>“Mean I have a voice like a pump?” Gofredo demanded.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m going to find out,” Ayesha Keithley said. “The next time that starts, I’m going to make a recording, and compare it with your voice-recording. I’ll give five to one there’ll be a similarity.”</p>
			<p>Questell got the foundation for the sonics lab dug, and began pouring concrete. That took water, and the pump ran continuously that afternoon. Concrete-mixing took more water the next day, and by noon the whole village population, down to the smallest child, was massed at the pumphouse, enthralled. Mom was snared by the sound like any of the rest; only Sonny was unaffected. Lillian and Ayesha compared recordings of the voices of the team with the pump-sound; in Gofredo’s they found an identical frequency-pattern.</p>
			<p>“We’ll need the new apparatus to be positive about it, but it’s there, all right,” Ayesha said. “That’s why Luis’ voice pleases them.”</p>
			<p>“That tags me; Old Pump-Mouth,” Gofredo said. “It’ll get all through the Corps, and they’ll be calling me that when I’m a four-star general, if I live that long.”</p>
			<p>Meillard was really worried, now. So was Bennet Fayon. He said so that afternoon at cocktail time.</p>
			<p>“It’s an addiction,” he declared. “Once they hear it, they have no will to resist; they just squat and listen. I don’t know what it’s doing to them, but I’m scared of it.”</p>
			<p>“I know one thing it’s doing,” Meillard said. “It’s keeping them from their work in the fields. For all we know, it may cause them to lose a crop they need badly for subsistence.”</p>
			<p>The native they had come to call the Lord Mayor evidently thought so, too. He was with the others, the next morning, squatting with his staff across his knees, as bemused as any of them, but when the pump stopped he rose and approached a group of Terrans, launching into what could only be an impassioned tirade. He pointed with his staff to the pump house, and to the semicircle of still motionless villagers. He pointed to the fields, and back to the people, and to the pump house again, gesturing vehemently with his other hand.</p>
			<p>
				<q>You make the noise. My people will not work while they hear it. The fields lie untended. Stop the noise, and let my people work.</q>
			</p>
			<p>Couldn’t possibly be any plainer.</p>
			<p>Then the pump started again. The Lord Mayor’s hands tightened on the staff; he was struggling tormentedly with himself, in vain. His face relaxed into the heartbroken expression of joy; he turned and shuffled over, dropping onto his haunches with the others.</p>
			<p>“Shut down the pump, Dave!” Meillard called out. “Cut the power off.”</p>
			<p>The <i>thugg-thugg</i>-ing stopped. The Lord Mayor rose, made an odd salaamlike bow toward the Terrans, and then turned on the people, striking with his staff and shrieking at them. A few got to their feet and joined him, screaming, pushing, tugging. Others joined. In a little while, they were all on their feet, straggling away across the fields.</p>
			<p>Dave Questell wanted to know what it meant; Meillard explained.</p>
			<p>“Well, what are we going to do for water?” the Navy engineer asked.</p>
			<p>“Soundproof the pump house. You can do that, can’t you?”</p>
			<p>“Sure. Mound it over with earth. We’ll have that done in a few hours.”</p>
			<p>That started Gofredo worrying. “This happens every time we colonize an inhabited planet. We give the natives something new. Then we find out it’s bad for them, and we try to take it away from them. And then the knives come out, and the shooting starts.”</p>
			<p>Luis Gofredo was also a specialist, speaking on his subject.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>While they were at lunch, Charley Loughran screened in from the other camp and wanted to talk to Bennet Fayon.</p>
			<p>“A funny thing, Bennet. I took a shot at a bird⁠ ⁠… no, a flying mammal⁠ ⁠… and dropped it. It was dead when it hit the ground, but there isn’t a mark on it. I want you to do an autopsy, and find out how I can kill things by missing them.”</p>
			<p>“How far away was it?”</p>
			<p>“Call it forty feet; no more.”</p>
			<p>“What were you using, Charley?” Ayesha Keithley called from the table.</p>
			<p>“Eight-point-five Mars-Consolidated pistol,” Loughran said. “I’d laid my shotgun down and walked away from it⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Twelve hundred foot-seconds,” Ayesha said. “Bow-wave as well as muzzle-blast.”</p>
			<p>“You think the report was what did it?” Fayon asked.</p>
			<p>“You want to bet it didn’t?” she countered.</p>
			<p>Nobody did.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Mom was sulky. She didn’t like what Dave Questell’s men were doing to the nice-noise-place. Ayesha and Lillian consoled her by taking her into the soundproofed room and playing the recording of the pump-noise for her. Sonny couldn’t care less, one way or another; he spent the afternoon teaching Mark Howell what the marks on paper meant. It took a lot of signs and playacting. He had learned about thirty ideographs; by combining them and drawing little pictures, he could express a number of simple ideas. There was, of course, a limit to how many of those things anybody could learn and remember⁠—look how long it took an Old Terran Chinese scribe to learn his profession⁠—but it was the beginning of a method of communication.</p>
			<p>Questell got the pump house mounded over. Ayesha came out and tried a sound-meter, and also Mom, on it while the pump was running. Neither reacted.</p>
			<p>A good many Svants were watching the work. They began to demonstrate angrily. A couple tried to interfere and were knocked down with rifle butts. The Lord Mayor and his Board of Aldermen came out with the big horn and harangued them at length, and finally got them to go back to the fields. As nearly as anybody could tell, he was friendly to and cooperative with the Terrans. The snooper over the village reported excitement in the plaza.</p>
			<p>Bennet Fayon had taken an airjeep to the other camp immediately after lunch. He was back by 1500, accompanied by Loughran. They carried a cloth-wrapped package into Fayon’s dissecting-room. At cocktail time, Paul Meillard had to go and get them.</p>
			<p>“Sorry,” Fayon said, joining the group. “Didn’t notice how late it was getting. We’re still doing a post on this svant-bat; that’s what Charley’s calling it, till we get the native name.</p>
			<p>“The immediate cause of death was spasmodic contraction of every muscle in the thing’s body; some of them were partly relaxed before we could get to work on it, but not completely. Every bone that isn’t broken is dislocated; a good many both. There is not the slightest trace of external injury. Everything was done by its own muscles.” He looked around. “I hope nobody covered Ayesha’s bet, after I left. If they did, she collects. The large outer membranes in the comb seem to be unaffected, but there is considerable compression of the small round ones inside, in just one area, and more on the left side than on the right. Charley says it was flying across in front of him from left to right.”</p>
			<p>“The receptor-area responding to the frequencies of the report,” Ayesha said.</p>
			<p>Anna de Jong made a passing gesture toward Fayon. “The baby’s yours, Bennet,” she said. “This isn’t psychological. I won’t accept a case of psychosomatic compound fracture.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t be too premature about it, Anna. I think that’s more or less what you have, here.”</p>
			<p>Everybody looked at him, surprised. His subject was comparative technology. The bio- and psycho-sciences were completely outside his field.</p>
			<p>“A lot of things have been bothering me, ever since the first contact. I’m beginning to think I’m on the edge of understanding them, now. Bennet, the higher life-forms here⁠—the people, and that domsee, and Charley’s svant-bat⁠—are structurally identical with us. I don’t mean gross structure, like ears and combs. I mean molecular and cellular and tissue structure. Is that right?”</p>
			<p>Fayon nodded. “Biology on this planet is exactly Terra type. Yes. With adequate safeguards, I’d even say you could make a viable tissue-graft from a Svant to a Terran, or vice versa.”</p>
			<p>“Ayesha, would the sound waves from that pistol-shot in any conceivable way have the sort of physical effect we’re considering?”</p>
			<p>“Absolutely not,” she said, and Luis Gofredo said: “I’ve been shot at and missed with pistols at closer range than that.”</p>
			<p>“Then it was the effect on the animal’s nervous system.”</p>
			<p>Anna shrugged. “It’s still Bennet’s baby. I’m a psychologist, not a neurologist.”</p>
			<p>“What I’ve been saying, all along,” Fayon reiterated complacently. “Their hearing is different from ours. This proves it.</p>
			<p>“It proves that they don’t hear at all.”</p>
			<p>He had expected an explosion; he wasn’t disappointed. They all contradicted him, many derisively. Signal reactions. Only Paul Meillard made the semantically appropriate response:</p>
			<p>“What do you mean, Mark?”</p>
			<p>“They don’t <em>hear</em> sound; they <em>feel</em> it. You all saw what they have inside their combs. Those things don’t transmit sound like the ears of any sound-sensitive life-form we’ve ever seen. They transform sound waves into tactile sensations.”</p>
			<p>Fayon cursed, slowly and luridly. Anna de Jong looked at him wide-eyed. He finished his cocktail and poured another. In the snooper screen, what looked like an indignation meeting was making uproar in the village plaza. Gofredo cut the volume of the speaker even lower.</p>
			<p>“That would explain a lot of things,” Meillard said slowly. “How hard it was for them to realize that we didn’t understand when they talked to us. A punch in the nose feels the same to anybody. They thought they were giving us bodily feelings. They didn’t know we were insensible to them.”</p>
			<p>“But they do⁠ ⁠… they do have a language,” Lillian faltered. “They talk.”</p>
			<p>“Not the way we understand it. If they want to say, ‘Me,’ it’s <q>tickle-pinch-rub</q>, even if it sounds like <i xml:lang="x-svanto">fwoonk</i> to us, when it doesn’t sound like <i xml:lang="x-svanto">pwink</i> or <i xml:lang="x-svanto">tweelt</i> or <i xml:lang="x-svanto">kroosh</i>. The tactile sensations, to a Svant, feel no more different than a massage by four different hands. Analogous to a word pronounced by four different voices, to us. They’ll have a code for expressing meanings in tactile sensation, just as we have a code for expressing meanings in audible sound.”</p>
			<p>“Except that when a Svant tells another, ‘I am happy,’ or ‘I have a stomachache,’ he makes the other one feel that way too,” Anna said. “That would carry an awful lot more conviction. I don’t imagine symptom-swapping is popular among Svants. Karl! You were nearly right, at that. This isn’t telepathy, but it’s a lot like it.”</p>
			<p>“So it is,” Dorver, who had been mourning his departed telepathy theory, said brightly. “And look how it explains their society. Peaceful, everybody in quick agreement⁠—” He looked at the screen and gulped. The Lord Mayor and his party had formed one clump, and the opposition was grouped at the other side of the plaza; they were screaming in unison at each other. “They make their decisions by endurance; the party that can resist the feelings of the other longest converts their opponents.”</p>
			<p>“Pure democracy,” Gofredo declared. “Rule by the party that can make the most noise.”</p>
			<p>“And I’ll bet that when they’re sick, they go around chanting, ‘I am well; I feel just fine!’ ” Anna said. “Autosuggestion would really work, here. Think of the feedback, too. One Svant has a feeling. He verbalizes it, and the sound of his own voice reinforces it in him. It is induced in his hearers, and they verbalize it, reenforcing it in themselves and in him. This could go on and on.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. It has. Look at their technology.” He felt more comfortable, now he was on home ground again. “A friend of mine, speaking about a mutual acquaintance, once said, ‘When they installed her circuits, they put in such big feeling circuits that there was no room left for any thinking circuits.’ I think that’s a perfect description of what I estimate Svant mentality to be. Take these bronze knives, and the musical instruments. Wonderful; the work of individuals trying to express feeling in metal or wood. But get an idea like the wheel, or even a pair of tongs? Poo! How would you state the First Law of Motion, or the Second Law of Thermodynamics, in tickle-pinch-rub terms? Sonny could grasp an idea like that. Sonny’s handicap, if you call it that, cuts him off from feel-thinking; he can think logically instead of sensually.”</p>
			<p>He sipped his cocktail and continued: “I can understand why the village is mounded up, too. I realized that while I was watching Dave’s gang bury the pump house. I’d been bothered by that, and by the absence of granaries for all the grain they raise, and by the number of people for so few and such small houses. I think the village is mostly underground, and the houses are just entrances, soundproofed, to shelter them from uncomfortable natural noises⁠—thunderstorms, for instance.”</p>
			<p>The horn was braying in the snooper-screen speaker; somebody wondered what it was for. Gofredo laughed.</p>
			<p>“I thought, at first, that it was a war-horn. It isn’t. It’s a peace-horn,” he said. “Public tranquilizer. The first day, they brought it out and blew it at us to make us peaceable.”</p>
			<p>“Now I see why Sonny is rejected and persecuted,” Anna was saying. “He must make all sorts of horrible noises that he can’t hear⁠ ⁠… that’s not the word; we have none for it⁠ ⁠… and nobody but his mother can stand being near him.”</p>
			<p>“Like me,” Lillian said. “Now I understand. Just think of the most revolting thing that could be done to you physically; that’s what I do to them every time I speak. And I always thought I had a nice voice,” she added, pathetically.</p>
			<p>“You have, for Terrans,” Ayesha said. “For Svants, you’ll just have to change it.”</p>
			<p>“But how⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“Use an analyzer; train it. That was why I took up sonics, in the first place. I had a voice like a crow with a sore throat, but by practicing with an analyzer, an hour a day, I gave myself an entirely different voice in a couple of months. Just try to get some pump-sound frequencies into it, like Luis.’ ”</p>
			<p>“But why? I’m no use here. I’m a linguist, and these people haven’t any language that I could ever learn, and they couldn’t even learn ours. They couldn’t learn to make sounds, as sounds.”</p>
			<p>“You’ve been doing very good work with Mom on those ideographs,” Meillard said. “Keep it up till you’ve taught her the Lingua Terra Basic vocabulary, and with her help we can train a few more. They can be our interpreters; we can write what we want them to say to the others. It’ll be clumsy, but it will work, and it’s about the only thing I can think of that will.”</p>
			<p>“And it will improve in time,” Ayesha added. “And we can make vocoders and visibilizers. Paul, you have authority to requisition personnel from the ship’s company. Draft me; I’ll stay here and work on it.”</p>
			<p>The rumpus in the village plaza was getting worse. The Lord Mayor and his adherents were being outshouted by the opposition.</p>
			<p>“Better do something about that in a hurry, Paul, if you don’t want a lot of Svants shot,” Gofredo said. “Give that another half hour and we’ll have visitors, with bows and spears.”</p>
			<p>“Ayesha, you have a recording of the pump,” Meillard said. “Load a record-player onto a jeep and fly over the village and play it for them. Do it right away. Anna, get Mom in here. We want to get her to tell that gang that from now on, at noon and for a couple of hours after sunset, when the work’s done, there will be free public pump-concerts, over the village plaza.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Ayesha and her warrant-officer helper and a Marine lieutenant went out hastily. Everybody else faced the screen to watch. In fifteen minutes, an airjeep was coming in on the village. As it circled low, a new sound, the steady <i>thugg-thugg, thugg-thugg</i> of the pump, began.</p>
			<p>The yelling and twittering and the blaring of the peace-horn died out almost at once. As the jeep circled down to housetop level, the two contending faction-clumps broke apart; their component individuals moved into the center of the plaza and squatted, staring up, letting the delicious waves of sound caress them.</p>
			<p>“Do we have to send a detail in a jeep to do that twice a day?” Gofredo asked. “We keep a snooper over the village; fit it with a loudspeaker and a timer; it can give them their <i>thugg-thugg</i>, on schedule, automatically.”</p>
			<p>“We might give the Lord Mayor a recording and a player and let him decide when the people ought to listen⁠—if that’s the word⁠—to it,” Dorver said. “Then it would be something of their own.”</p>
			<p>“No!” He spoke so vehemently that the others started. “You know what would happen? Nobody would be able to turn it off; they’d all be hypnotized, or doped, or whatever it is. They’d just sit in a circle around it till they starved to death, and when the power-unit gave out, the record-player would be surrounded by a ring of skeletons. We’ll just have to keep on playing it for them ourselves. Terrans’ Burden.”</p>
			<p>“That’ll give us a sanction over them,” Gofredo observed. “Extra <i>thugg-thugg</i> if they’re very good; shut it off on them if they act nasty. And find out what Lillian has in her voice that the rest of us don’t have, and make a good loud recording of that, and stash it away along with the rest of the heavy-weapons ammunition. You know, you’re not going to have any trouble at all, when we go down-country to talk to the king or whatever. This is better than firewater ever was.”</p>
			<p>“We must never misuse our advantage, Luis,” Meillard said seriously. “We must use it only for their good.”</p>
			<p>He really meant it. Only⁠—You had to know some general history to study technological history, and it seemed to him that that pious assertion had been made a few times before. Some of the others who had made it had really meant it, too, but that had made little difference in the long run.</p>
			<p>Fayon and Anna were talking enthusiastically about the work ahead of them.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know where your subject ends and mine begins,” Anna was saying. “We’ll just have to handle it between us. What are we going to call it? We certainly can’t call it hearing.”</p>
			<p>“Nonauditory sonic sense is the only thing I can think of,” Fayon said. “And that’s such a clumsy term.”</p>
			<p>“Mark; you thought of it first,” Anna said. “What do you think?”</p>
			<p>“Nonauditory sonic sense. It isn’t any worse than Domesticated Type C, and that got cut down to size. <em>Naudsonce.</em>”</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">I</h3>
				<p>Chester Pelton retracted his paunch as far as the breakfast seat would permit; the table, its advent preceded by a collection of mouth-watering aromas, slid noiselessly out of the pantry and clicked into place in front of him.</p>
				<p>“Everything all right, Miss Claire?” a voice floated out after it from beyond. “Anything else you want?”</p>
				<p>“Everything’s just fine, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Harris,” Claire replied. “I suppose <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton’ll want seconds, and Ray’ll probably want thirds and fourths of everything.” She waved a hand over the photocell that closed the pantry door, and slid into place across from her brother, who already had a glass of fruit juice in one hand and was lifting platter covers with the other.</p>
				<p>“Real eggs!” the boy was announcing. “Bacon. Wheat-bread toast.” He looked again. “Hey, Sis, is this real cow-made butter?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Now go ahead and eat.”</p>
				<p>As though Ray needed encouragement, Chester Pelton thought, watching his son use a spoon⁠—the biggest one available⁠—to dump gobs of honey on his toast. While he was helping himself to bacon and eggs, he could hear Ray’s full-mouthed exclamation: “This is real bee-comb honey, too!” That pleased him. The boy was a true Pelton; only needed one bite to distinguish between real and synthetic food.</p>
				<p>“Bet this breakfast didn’t cost a dollar under five <abbr>C</abbr>,” Ray continued, a little more audibly, between bites.</p>
				<p>That was another Pelton trait; even at fifteen, the boy was learning the value of money. Claire seemed to disapprove, however.</p>
				<p>“Oh, Ray; try not to always think of what things cost,” she reproved.</p>
				<p>“If I had all she spends on natural food, I could have a this-season’s model ’copter-bike, like Jimmy Hartnett,” Ray continued.</p>
				<p>Pelton frowned. “I don’t want you running around with that boy, Ray,” he said, his mouth full of bacon and eggs. Under his daughter’s look of disapproval, he swallowed hastily, then continued: “He’s not the sort of company I want my son keeping.”</p>
				<p>“But, Senator,” Ray protested. “He lives next door to us. Why, we can see Hartnett’s aerial from the top of our landing stage!”</p>
				<p>“That doesn’t matter,” he said, in a tone meant to indicate that the subject was not to be debated. “He’s a Literate!”</p>
				<p>“More eggs, Senator?” Claire asked, extending the platter and gesturing with the serving knife.</p>
				<p>He chuckled inwardly. Claire always knew what to do when his temper started climbing to critical mass. He allowed her to load his plate again.</p>
				<p>“And speaking of our landing stage, have you been up there, this morning, Ray?” he asked.</p>
				<p>They both looked at him inquiringly.</p>
				<p>“Delivered last evening, while you two were out,” he explained. “New winter model Rolls-Cadipac.” He felt a glow of paternal pleasure as Claire gave a yelp of delight and aimed a glancing kiss at the top of his bald head. Ray dropped his fork, slid from his seat, and bolted for the lift, even bacon, eggs, and real bee-comb honey forgotten.</p>
				<p>With elaborate absentmindedness, Chester Pelton reached for the switch to turn on the video screen over the pantry door.</p>
				<p>“Oh-oh! Oh-oh!” Claire’s slender hand went out to stop his own. “Not till coffee and cigarettes, Senator.”</p>
				<p>“It’s almost oh-eight-fifteen; I want the newscast.”</p>
				<p>“Can’t you just relax for a while? Honestly, Senator, you’re killing yourself.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, rubbish! I’ve been working a little hard, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You’ve been working too hard. And today, with the sale at the store, and the last day of the campaign⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Why the devil did that idiot of a Latterman have the sale advertised for today, anyhow?” he fumed. “Doesn’t he know I’m running for the Senate?”</p>
				<p>“I doubt it,” Claire said. “He may have heard of it, the way you’ve heard about an election in Pakistan or Abyssinia, or he just may not know there is such a thing as politics. I think he does know there’s a world outside the store, but he doesn’t care much what goes on in it.” She pushed her plate aside, poured a cup of coffee, and levered a cigarette from the Readilit, puffing at it with the relish of the morning’s first smoke. “All he knows is that we’re holding our sale three days ahead of Macy &amp; Gimbel’s.”</p>
				<p>“Russ is a good businessman,” Pelton said seriously. “I wish you’d take a little more interest in him, Claire.”</p>
				<p>“If you mean what I think you do, no thanks,” Claire replied. “I suppose I’ll get married, some day⁠—most girls do⁠—but it’ll be to somebody who can hang his business up at the office before he comes home. Russ Latterman is so married to the store that if he married me too, it’d be bigamy. Ready for your coffee?” Without waiting for an answer, she filled his cup and ejected a lighted cigarette from the box for him, then snapped on the video screen.</p>
				<p>It lit at once, and a nondescriptly handsome young man was grinning toothily out of it. He wore a white smock, halfway to his knees, and, over it, an old-fashioned Sam Browne belt which supported a bulky leather-covered tablet and a large stylus. On the strap which crossed his breast five or six little metal badges twinkled.</p>
				<p>“… Why no other beer can compare with delicious, tangy, Cardon’s Black Bottle. Won’t you try it?” he pleaded. “Then you will see for yourself why millions of happy drinkers always Call For Cardon’s. And now, that other favorite of millions, Literate First Class Elliot <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Mongery.”</p>
				<p>Pelton muttered: “Why Frank sponsors that blabbermouth of a Mongery⁠—”</p>
				<p>Ray, sliding back onto the bench, returned to his food.</p>
				<p>“Jimmy’s book had pictures,” he complained, forking up another mixture of eggs, bacon, toast and honey.</p>
				<p>“Book?” Claire echoed. “Oh, the instructions for the ’copter?”</p>
				<p>“Pipe down, both of you!” Pelton commanded. “The newscast⁠—”</p>
				<p>Literate First Class Elliot <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Mongery, revealed by a quick left quarter-turn of the pickup camera, wore the same starchy white smock, the same Sam Browne belt glittering with the badges of the organizations and corporations for whom he was authorized to practice Literacy. The tablet on his belt, Pelton knew, was really a camouflaged holster for a small automatic, and the gold stylus was a gas-projector. The black-leather-jacketed bodyguards, of course, were discreetly out of range of the camera. Members of the Associated Fraternities of Literates weren’t exactly loved by the non-reading public they claimed to serve. The sight of one of those starchy, perpetually-spotless, white smocks always affected Pelton like a red cape to a bull. He snorted in disdain. The raised eyebrow toward the announcer on the left, the quick, perennially boyish smile, followed by the levelly serious gaze into the camera⁠—the whole act might have been a film-transcription of Mongery’s first appearance on the video, fifteen years ago. At least, it was off the same ear of corn.</p>
				<p>“That big hunk of cheese,” Ray commented. For once, Pelton didn’t shush him; that was too close to his own attitude, at least in family-breakfast-table terminology.</p>
				<p>“… First of all; for the country, and especially the Newer New York area, and by the way, it looks as though somebody thought somebody needed a little cooling off, but we’ll come to that later. Here’s the forecast: Today and tomorrow, the weather will continue fine; warm in the sun, chilly in the shadows. There won’t be anything to keep you from the polls, tomorrow, except bird-hunting, or a last chance at a game of golf. This is the first time within this commentator’s memory that the weather has definitely been in favor of the party out of power.</p>
				<p>“On the world scene: You’ll be glad to hear that the survivors of the wrecked strato-rocket have all been rescued from the top of Mount Everest, after a difficult and heroic effort by the Royal Nepalese Air Force.⁠ ⁠… The results of last week’s election in Russia are being challenged by twelve of the fourteen parties represented on the ballot; the only parties not hurling accusations of fraud are the Democrats, who won, and the Christian Communists, who are about as influential in Russian politics as the Vegetarian-Anti-Vaccination Party is here.⁠ ⁠… The Central Diplomatic Council of the Reunited Nations has just announced, for the hundred and seventy-eighth time, that the Arab-Israel dispute has been finally, definitely and satisfactorily settled. This morning’s reports from Baghdad and Tel Aviv only list four Arabs and six Israelis killed in border clashes in the past twenty-four hours, so maybe they’re really getting things patched up, after all. During the same period, there were more fatalities in Newer New York as a result of clashes between the private troops of rival racket gangs, political parties and business houses.</p>
				<p>“Which brings us to the local scene. On my way to the studio this morning, I stopped at City Hall, and found our genial Chief of Police Delaney, ‘Irish’ Delaney to most of us, hard at work with a portable disintegrator, getting rid of record disks and recording tapes of old and long-settled cases. He had a couple of amusing stories. For instance, a lone Independent-Conservative partisan broke up a Radical-Socialist mass meeting preparatory to a march to demonstrate in Double Times Square, by applying his pocket lighter to one of the heat-sensitive boxes in the building and activating the sprinkler system. By the time the Radicals had gotten into dry clothing, there was a, well, sort of, impromptu Conservative demonstration going on in Double Times Square, and one of the few things the local gendarmes won’t stand for is an attempt to hold two rival political meetings in the same area.</p>
				<p>“Curiously, while it was the Radicals who got soaked, it was the Conservatives who sneezed,” Mongery went on, his face glowing with mischievous amusement. “It seems that while they were holding a monster rally at Hague Hall, in North Jersey Borough, some person or persons unknown got at the air-conditioning system with a tank of sneeze gas, which didn’t exactly improve either the speaking style of Senator Grant Hamilton or the attentiveness of his audience. Needless to say, there is no police investigation of either incident. Election shenanigans, like college pranks, are fair play as long as they don’t cause an outright holocaust. And that, I think, is as it should be,” Mongery went on, more seriously. “Most of the horrors of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries were the result of taking politics too seriously.”</p>
				<p>Pelton snorted again. That was the Literate line, all right; treat politics as a joke and an election as a sporting event, let the Independent-Conservative grafters stay in power, and let the Literates run the country through them. Not, of course, that he disapproved of those boys in the Young Radical League who’d thought up that sneeze-gas trick.</p>
				<p>“And now, what you’ve been waiting for,” Mongery continued. “The final Trotter Poll’s preelection analysis.” A novice Literate advanced, handing him a big looseleaf book, which he opened with the reverence a Literate always displayed toward the written word. “This,” he said, “is going to surprise you. For the whole state of Penn-Jersey-York, the poll shows a probable Radical-Socialist vote of approximately thirty million, an Independent-Conservative vote of approximately ten and a half million, and a vote of about a million for what we call the Who-Gives-A-Damn Party, which, frankly, is the party of your commentator’s choice. Very few sections differ widely from this average⁠—there will be a much heavier Radical vote in the Pittsburgh area, and traditionally Conservative Philadelphia and the upper Hudson Valley will give the Radicals a much smaller majority.”</p>
				<p>They all looked at one another, thunderstruck.</p>
				<p>“If Mongery’s admitting that, I’m in!” Pelton exclaimed.</p>
				<p>“Yeah, we can start calling him Senator, now, and really mean it,” Ray said. “Maybe old Mongie isn’t such a bad sort of twerp, after all.”</p>
				<p>“Considering that the Conservatives carried this state by a substantial majority in the presidential election of two years ago, and by a huge majority in the previous presidential election of 2136,” Mongery, in the screen, continued, “this verdict of the almost infallible Trotter Poll needs some explaining. For the most part, it is the result of the untiring efforts of one man, the dynamic new leader of the Radical-Socialists and their present candidate for the Consolidated States of North America Senate, Chester Pelton, who has transformed that once-moribund party into the vital force it is today. And this achievement has been due, very largely, to a single slogan which he had hammered into your ears: <em>Put the Literates in their place; our servants, not our masters!</em>” He brushed a hand deprecatingly over his white smock and fingered the badges on his belt.</p>
				<p>“There has always been, on the part of the Illiterate public, some resentment against organized Literacy. In part, it has been due to the high fees charged for Literate services, and to what seems, to many, to be monopolistic practices. But behind that is a general attitude of anti-intellectualism which is our heritage from the disastrous wars of the Twentieth and Twenty-first Centuries. Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman of this attitude. In his view, it was men who could read and write who hatched the diabolical political ideologies and designed the frightful nuclear weapons of that period. In his mind, Literacy is equated with <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Mein Kampf</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Das Kapital</i>, with the A-bomb and the H-bomb, with concentration camps and blasted cities. From this position, of course, I beg politely to differ. Literate men also gave us the Magna Charta and the Declaration of Independence.</p>
				<p>“Now, in spite of a lunatic fringe in the Consolidated Illiterates’ Organization who want just that, Chester Pelton knows that we cannot abolish Literacy entirely. Even with modern audiovisual recording, need exists for some modicum of written recording, which can be rapidly scanned and selected from⁠—indexing, cataloguing, tabulating data, et cetera⁠—and for at least a few men and women who can form and interpret the written word. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton, himself, is the owner of a huge department store, employing over a thousand Illiterates; he must at all times have the services of at least fifty Literates.”</p>
				<p>“And pays through the nose for them, too!” Pelton growled. It was more than fifty; and Russ Latterman had been forced to get twenty extras sent in for the sale.</p>
				<p>“Now, since we cannot renounce Literacy entirely, without sinking to fellahin barbarism, and here I definitely part company with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton, he fears the potential power of organized Literacy. In a word, he fears a future Literate Dictatorship.”</p>
				<p>“Future? What do you think we have now?” Pelton demanded.</p>
				<p>“Nobody,” Mongery said, as though replying to him, “is stupid enough, today, to want to be a dictator. That ended by the middle of the Twenty-first Century. Everybody knows what happened to Mussolini, and Hitler, and Stalin, and all their imitators. Why, it is as much the public fear of Big Government as the breakdown of civil power because of the administrative handicap of a shortage of Literate administrators that is responsible for the disgraceful lawlessness of the past hundred years. Thus, it speaks well for the public trust in Chester Pelton’s known integrity and sincerity that so many of our people are willing to agree to his program for socialized Literacy. They feel that he can be trusted, and, violently as I disagree with him, I can only say that that trust is not misplaced.</p>
				<p>“Of course, there is also the question, so often raised by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton, that under the Hamilton machine, the politics, and particularly the enforcement of the laws, in this state, are unbelievably corrupt, but I wonder⁠—”</p>
				<p>Mongery paused. “Just a moment; I see a flash bulletin being brought in.” The novice Literate came to his side and gave him a slip of paper, at which he glanced. Then he laughed heartily.</p>
				<p>“It seems that shortly after I began speaking, the local blue-ribbon grand jury issued a summons for Chief Delaney to appear before them, with all his records. Unfortunately, the summons could not be served; Chief Delaney had just boarded a strato-rocket from Tom Dewey Field for Buenos Aires.” He cocked an eye at the audience. “I know Irish is going to have a nice time, down there in the springtime of the Southern Hemisphere. And, incidentally, the Argentine is one of the few major powers which never signed the World Extradition Convention of 2087.” He raised his hand to his audience. “And now, until tomorrow at breakfast, sincerely yours for Cardon’s Black Bottle, Elliot <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Mongery.”</p>
				<p>“Well, whattaya know; that guy was plugging for you!” Ray said. “And see how he managed to slide in that bit about corruption, right before his stooge handed him that bulletin?”</p>
				<p>“I guess every Literate has his price,” Chester Pelton said. “I wonder how much of my money that cost. I always wondered why Frank Cardon sponsored Mongery. Now I know. Mongery can be had.”</p>
				<p>“Uh, beg your pardon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton,” a voice from the hall broke in.</p>
				<p>He turned. Olaf Olafsson, the ’copter driver, was standing at the entrance to the breakfast nook, a smudge of oil on his cheek and his straw-colored hair in disorder. “How do I go about startin’ this new ’copter?”</p>
				<p>“What?” Olaf had been his driver for ten years. He would have been less surprised had the ceiling fallen in. “You don’t know how to start it?”</p>
				<p>“No, sir. The controls is all different from on the summer model. Every time I try to raise it, it backs up; if I try to raise it much more, we won’t have no wall left on the landing stage.”</p>
				<p>“Well, isn’t there a book?”</p>
				<p>“There ain’t no pictures in it; nothing but print. It’s a Literate book,” Olaf said in disgust, as though at something obscene. “An’ there ain’t nothin’ on the instrument board but letters.”</p>
				<p>“That’s right,” Ray agreed. “I saw the book; no pictures in it at all.”</p>
				<p>“Well, of all the quarter-witted stupidity! The confounded imbeciles at that agency⁠—”</p>
				<p>Pelton started to his feet. Claire unlocked the table and slid it out of his way. Ray, on a run, started for the lift and vanished.</p>
				<p>“I think some confounded Literate at the Rolls-Cadipac agency did that,” he fumed. “Thought it would be a joke to send me a Literate instruction book along with a ’copter with a Literate instrument board. Ah, I get it! So I’d have to call in a Literate to show me how to start my own ’copter, and by noon they’d be laughing about it in every bar from Pittsburgh to Plattsburg. Sneaky Literate trick!” They went to the lift, and found the door closed in their faces. “Oh, confound that boy!”</p>
				<p>Claire pressed the button. Ray must have left the lift, for the operating light went on, and in a moment the door opened. He crowded into the lift, along with his daughter and Olaf.</p>
				<p>On the landing stage, Ray was already in the ’copter, poking at buttons on the board.</p>
				<p>“Look, Olaf!” he called. “They just shifted them around a little from the summer model. This one, where the prop-control used to be on the old model, is the one that backs it up on the ground. Here’s the one that erects and extends the prop,”⁠—he pushed it, and the prop snapped obediently into place⁠—“and here’s the one that controls the lift.”</p>
				<p>An ugly suspicion stabbed at Chester Pelton, bringing with it a feeling of frightened horror.</p>
				<p>“How do you know?” he demanded.</p>
				<p>Ray’s eyes remained on the instrument hoard. He pushed another button, and the propeller began swinging in a lazy circle; he pressed down with his right foot, and the ’copter lifted a foot or so.</p>
				<p>“What?” he asked. “Oh, Jimmy showed me how theirs works. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartnett got one like it a week ago.” He motioned to Olaf, setting the ’copter down again. “Come here; I’ll show you.”</p>
				<p>The suspicion, and the horror passed in a wave of relief.</p>
				<p>“You think you and Olaf, between you, can get that thing to school?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Sure! Easy!”</p>
				<p>“All right. You show Olaf how to run it. Olaf, as soon as you’ve dropped Ray at school, take that thing to the Rolls-Cadipac agency, and get a new one, with a proper instrument board, and a proper picture book of operating instructions. I’m going to call Sam Huschack up personally and give him royal hell about this. Sure you can handle it, now?”</p>
				<p>He watched the ’copter rise to the two thousand foot local traffic level and turn in the direction of Mineola High School, fifty miles away. He was still looking anxiously after it as it dwindled to a tiny dot and vanished.</p>
				<p>“They’ll make it all right,” Claire told him. “Olaf has a strong back, and Ray has a good head.”</p>
				<p>“It wasn’t that that I was worried about.” He turned and looked, half ashamed, at his daughter. “You know, for a minute, there, I thought.⁠ ⁠… I thought Ray could read!”</p>
				<p>“Father!” She was so shocked that she forgot the nickname they had given him when he had announced his candidacy for Senate, in the spring. “You didn’t!”</p>
				<p>“I know; it’s an awful thing to think, but⁠—Well, the kids today do the craziest things. There’s that Hartnett boy he runs around with; Tom Hartnett bought Literate training for him. And that fellow Prestonby; I don’t trust him⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Prestonby?” Claire asked, puzzled.</p>
				<p>“Oh, you know. The principal at school. You’ve met him.”</p>
				<p>Claire wrinkled her brow⁠—just like her mother, when she was trying to remember something.</p>
				<p>“Oh, yes. I met him at that <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.T.A.</abbr> meeting. He didn’t impress me as being much like a teacher, but I suppose they think anything’s good enough for us Illiterates.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Literate First Class Ralph <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">N.</abbr> Prestonby remained standing by the lectern, looking out over the crowded auditorium, still pleasantly surprised to estimate the day’s attendance at something like ninety-seven percent of enrollment. That was really good; why, it was only three percent short of perfect! Maybe it was the new rule requiring a sound-recorded excuse for absence. Or it could have been his propaganda campaign about the benefits of education. Or, very easily, it could have been the result of sending Doug Yetsko and some of his boys around to talk to recalcitrant parents. It was good to see that that was having some effect beside an increase in the number of attempts on his life, or the flood of complaints to the Board of Education. Well, Lancedale had gotten Education merged with his Office of Communications, and Lancedale was back of him to the limit, so the complaints had died out on the empty air. And Doug Yetsko was his bodyguard, so most of the would-be assassins had died, also.</p>
				<p>The “North American Anthem,” which had replaced the “Star-Spangled Banner” after the United States-Canadian-Mexican merger, came to an end. The students and their white-smocked teachers, below, relaxed from attention; most of them sat down, while monitors and teachers in the rear were getting the students into the aisles and marching them off to study halls and classrooms and workshops. The orchestra struck up a lively march tune. He leaned his left elbow⁠—Literates learned early, or did not live to learn, not to immobilize the right hand⁠—on the lectern and watched the interminable business of getting the students marched out, yearning, as he always did at this time, for the privacy of his office, where he could smoke his pipe. Finally, they were all gone, and the orchestra had gathered up its instruments and filed out into the wings of the stage, and he looked up to the left and said, softly:</p>
				<p>“All right, Doug; show’s over.”</p>
				<p>With a soft thud, the big man dropped down from the guard’s cubicle overhead, grinning cheerfully. He needed a shave⁠—Yetsko always did, in the mornings⁠—and in his leather Literates’ guard uniform, he looked like some ogreish giant out of the mythology of the past.</p>
				<p>“I was glad to have you up there with the Big Noise, this morning,” Prestonby said. “What a mob! I’m still trying to figure out why we have such an attendance.”</p>
				<p>“Don’t you get it, captain?” Yetsko was reaching up to lock the door of his cubicle; he seemed surprised at Prestonby’s obtuseness. “Day before election; the little darlings’ moms and pops don’t want them out running around. We can look for another big crowd tomorrow, too.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby gave a snort of disgust. “Of course; how imbecilic can I really get? I didn’t notice any of them falling down, so I suppose you didn’t see anything out of line.”</p>
				<p>“Well, the hall monitors make them turn in their little playthings at the doors,” Yetsko said, “but hall monitors can be gotten at, and some of the stuff they make in Manual Training, when nobody’s watching them⁠—”</p>
				<p>Prestonby nodded. Just a week before, a crude but perfectly operative 17-<abbr>mm</abbr> shotgun had been discovered in the last stages of manufacture in the machine shop, and five out of six of the worn-out files would vanish, to be ground down into dirks. He often thought of the stories of his grandfather, who had been a major during the Occupation of Russia, after the Fourth World War. Those old-timers didn’t know how easy they’d had it; they should have tried to run an Illiterate high school.</p>
				<p>Yetsko was still grumbling slanders on the legitimacy of the student body. “One of those little angels shoots me, it’s just a cute little prank, and we oughtn’t to frown on the little darling when it’s just trying to express its dear little personality, or we might give it complexes, or something,” he falsettoed incongruously. “And if the little darling’s mistake doesn’t kill me outright and I shoot back, people talk about King Herod!” He used language about the Board of Education and the taxpaying public that was probably subversive within the meaning of the Loyalty Oath. “I wish I had a pair of 40-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-cannons up there, instead of that sono gun.”</p>
				<p>“Each class is a little worse than the one before; in about five years, they’ll be making H-bombs in the lab,” Prestonby said. In the last week, a dozen pupils had been seriously cut or blackjacked in hall and locker-room fights. “Nice citizens of the future; nice future to look forward to growing old in.”</p>
				<p>“We won’t,” Yetsko comforted him. “We can’t be lucky all the time; in about a year, they’ll find both of us stuffed into a broom closet, when they start looking around to see what’s making all the stink.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Prestonby took the thick-barreled gas pistol from the shelf under the lectern and shoved it into his hip pocket; Yetsko picked up a two-and-a-half foot length of rubber hose and tucked it under his left arm. Together, they went back through the wings and out into the hallway that led to the office. So a Twenty-second Century high school was a place where a teacher carried a pistol and a teargas projector and a sleep-gas gun, and had a bodyguard, and still walked in danger of his life from armed teenage hooligans. It was meaningless to ask whose fault it was. There had been the World Wars, and the cold-war interbellum periods⁠—rising birth rates, huge demands on the public treasury for armaments, with the public taxed to the saturation point, and no money left for the schools. There had been fantastic “Progressive” education experiments⁠—even in the Fifties of the Twentieth Century, in the big cities, children were being pushed through grade school without having learned to read. And when there had been money available for education, school boards had insisted on spending it for audiovisual equipment, recordings, films, anything but textbooks. And there had been that lunatic theory that children should be taught to read by recognizing whole words instead of learning the alphabet. And more and more illiterates had been shoved out of the schools, into a world where radio and television and moving pictures were supplanting books and newspapers, and more and more children of illiterates had gone to school without any desire or incentive to learn to read. And finally, the illiterates had become Illiterates, and literacy had become Literacy.</p>
				<p>And now, the Associated Fraternities of Literates had come to monopolize the ability to read and write, and a few men like William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lancedale, with a handful of followers like Ralph <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">N.</abbr> Prestonby, were trying⁠—</p>
				<p>The gleaming cleanliness of the corridor, as always, heartened Prestonby a little; it was a trophy of victory from his first two days at Mineola High School, three years ago. He remembered what they had looked like when he had first seen them.</p>
				<p>“This school is a pig pen!” he had barked at the janitorial force. “And even if they are Illiterates, these children aren’t pigs; they deserve decent surroundings. This school will be cleaned, immediately, from top to bottom, and it’ll be kept that way.”</p>
				<p>The janitors, all political appointees, Independent-Conservative party-hacks, secure in their jobs, had laughed derisively. The building superintendent, without troubling to rise, had answered him:</p>
				<p>“Young man, you don’t want to get off on the wrong foot, here,” he had said. “This here’s the way this school’s always been run, an’ it’s gonna take a lot more than you to change it.”</p>
				<p>The fellow’s name, he recalled, was Kettner; Lancedale had given him a briefing which had included some particulars about him. He was an Independent-Conservative ward-committeeman. He had gotten his present job after being fired from his former position as mailman for listening to other peoples’ mail with his pocket recorder-reproducer.</p>
				<p>“Yetsko,” he had said. “Kick this bum out on his face.”</p>
				<p>“You can’t get away with⁠—” Kettner had begun. Yetsko had yanked him out of his chair with one hand and started for the door with him.</p>
				<p>“Just a moment, Yetsko,” he had said.</p>
				<p>Thinking that he was backing down, they had all begun grinning at him.</p>
				<p>“Don’t bother opening the door,” he had said. “Just kick him out.”</p>
				<p>After the third kick, Kettner had gotten the door open, himself; the fourth kick sent him across the hall to the opposite wall. He pulled himself to his feet and limped away, never to return. The next morning, the school was spotless. It had stayed that way.</p>
				<p>Beside him, Yetsko must also have returned mentally to the past.</p>
				<p>“Looks better now than it did when we first saw it, captain,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Yes. It didn’t take us as long to clean up this mess as it did to clean up that mutinous guards company in Pittsburgh. But when we cleaned that up, it stayed cleaned. This is like trying to bail out a boat with a pitchfork.”</p>
				<p>“Yeah. I wish we’dda stayed in Pittsburgh, captain. I wish we’d never seen this place!”</p>
				<p>“So do I!” Prestonby agreed, heartily.</p>
				<p>No, he didn’t, either. If he’d never have come to Mineola High School, he’d never have found Claire Pelton.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Sitting down again at the breakfast table with her father, Claire levered another cigarette out of the Readilit and puffed at it with exaggeratedly bored slowness. She was still frightened. Ray shouldn’t have done what he did, even if he had furnished a plausible explanation. The trouble with plausible explanations was having to make them. Sooner or later, you made too many, and then you made one that wasn’t so plausible, and then all the others were remembered, and they all looked phony. And why had the Senator had to mention Ralph? Was he beginning to suspect the truth about that, too?</p>
				<p>I hope not! she thought desperately. If he ever found out about that, it’d kill him. Just kill him, period!</p>
				<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Harris must have turned off the video, after they had gone up to the landing stage. To cover her nervousness, she reached up and snapped it on again. The screen lit, and from it a young man with dark eyes under bushy black brows was shouting angrily:</p>
				<p>“… Most obvious sort of conspiracy! If the Radical-Socialist Party leaders, or the Consolidated Illiterates’ Organization Political Action Committee, need any further evidence of the character of their candidate and idolized leader, Chester Pelton, the treatment given to Pelton’s candidacy by Literate First Class Elliot <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Mongery, this morning, ought to be sufficient to remove the scales from the eyes of the blindest of them. I won’t state, in so many words, that Chester Pelton’s sold out the Radical-Socialists and the Consolidated Illiterates’ Organization to the Associated Fraternities of Literates, because, since no witness to any actual transfer of money can be found, such a statement would be libelous⁠—provided Pelton had nerve enough to sue me.”</p>
				<p>“Why, you dirty misbegotten illegitimate⁠—!” Pelton was on his feet. His hand went to his hip, and then, realizing that he was unarmed and, in any case, confronted only by an electronic image, he sat down again.</p>
				<p>“Pelton’s been yapping for socialized Literacy,” the man on the screen continued. “I’m not going back to the old argument that any kind of socialization is only the thin edge of the wedge which will pry open the pit of horrors from which the world has climbed since the Fourth World War. If you don’t realize that now, it’s no use for me to repeat it again. But I will ask you, do you realize, for a moment, what a program of socialized Literacy would mean, apart from the implications of any kind of socialization? It would mean that inside of five years, the Literates would control the whole government. They control the courts, now⁠—only a Literate can become a lawyer, and only a lawyer can become a judge. They control the armed forces⁠—only a Literate can enter West Point or Fort MacKenzie or Chapultepec or White Sands or Annapolis. And, if Chester Pelton’s socialization scheme goes into effect, there will be no branch of the government which will not be completely under the control of the Associated Fraternities of Literates!”</p>
				<p>The screen went suddenly dark. Her father turned, to catch her with her hand still on the switch.</p>
				<p>“Put it back on; I want to hear what that lying pimp of a Slade Gardner’s saying about me!”</p>
				<p>“Phooy; you’d have shot it out, yourself, if you’d had your gun on. I saw you reaching for it. Now be quiet, and take it easy,” she ordered.</p>
				<p>He reached toward the Readilit for a cigarette, then his hand stopped. His face was contorted with pain; he gave a gasp of suffocation.</p>
				<p>Claire cried in dismay: “You’re not going to have another of those attacks? Where are the nitrocaine bulbs?”</p>
				<p>“Don’t⁠ ⁠… have any⁠ ⁠… here. Some at the office, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>“I told you to get more,” she accused.</p>
				<p>“Oh, I don’t need them, really.” His voice was steadier, now; the spasm of pain had passed. He filled his coffee cup and sipped from it. “Turn on the video again, Claire. I want to hear what that Gardner’s saying.”</p>
				<p>“I will not! Don’t you have people at party headquarters monitoring this stuff? Well, then. Somebody’ll prepare an answer, if he needs answering.”</p>
				<p>“I think he does. A lot of these dumbos’ll hear that and believe it. I’ll talk to Frank. He’ll know what to do.”</p>
				<p>Frank again. She frowned.</p>
				<p>“Look, Senator; you think Frank Cardon’s your friend, but I don’t trust him. I never could,” she said. “I think he’s utterly and entirely unscrupulous. Amoral, I believe, is the word. Like a savage, or a pirate, or one of the old-time Nazis or Communists.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Claire!” her father protested. “Frank’s in a tough business⁠—you have no idea the lengths competition goes to in the beer business⁠—and he’s been in politics, and dealing with racketeers and labor unions, all his life. But he’s a good sound Illiterate⁠—family Illiterate for four generations, like ours⁠—and I’d trust him with anything. You heard this fellow Mongery⁠—I always have to pause to keep from calling him Mongrel⁠—saying that I deserved the credit for pulling the Radicals out of the mud and getting the party back on the tracks. Well, I couldn’t have begun to do it without Frank Cardon.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Frank Cardon stood on the sidewalk, looking approvingly into the window of O’Reilly’s Tavern, in which his display crew had already set up the spread for the current week. On either side was a giant six-foot replica, in black glass, of the Cardon bottle, in the conventional shape accepted by an Illiterate public as containing beer, bearing the red Cardon label with its pictured bottle in a central white disk. Because of the heroic size of the bottles, the pictured bottle on the label bore a bottle bearing a label bearing a bottle bearing a bottle on a label.⁠ ⁠… He counted eight pictured bottles, down to the tiniest dot of black. There were four-foot bottles next to the six-foot bottles, and three-foot bottles next to them, and, in the middle background, a life-size tri-dimensional picture of an almost nude and incredibly pulchritudinous young lady smiling in invitation at the passing throng and extending a foaming bottle of Cardon’s in her hand. Aside from the printed trademark-registry statements on the labels, there was not a printed word visible in the window.</p>
				<p>He pushed through the swinging doors and looked down the long room, with the chairs still roosting sleepily on the tables, and made a quick count of the early drinkers, two thirds of them in white smocks and Sam Browne belts, obviously from Literates’ Hall, across the street. Late drinkers, he corrected himself mentally; they’d be the night shift, having their drinks before going home.</p>
				<p>“Good morning, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon,” the bartender greeted him. “Still drinking your own?”</p>
				<p>“Hasn’t poisoned me yet,” Cardon told him. “Or anybody else.” He folded a <abbr>C</abbr>-bill accordion-wise and set it on edge on the bar. “Give everybody what they want.”</p>
				<p>“Drink up, gentlemen, and have one on <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon,” the bartender announced, then lowered his voice. “O’Reilly wants to see you. About⁠—” He gave a barely perceptible nod in the direction of the building across the street.</p>
				<p>“Yes; I want to see him, too.” Cardon poured from the bottle in front of him, accepted the thanks of the house, and, when the bartender brought the fifteen-dollars-odd change from the dozen drinks, he pushed it back.</p>
				<p>He drank slowly, looking around the room, then set down his empty glass and went back, past two doors which bore pictured half-doors revealing, respectively, masculine-trousered and feminine-stockinged ankles, and opened the unmarked office door beyond. The bartender, he knew, had pushed the signal button; the door was unlocked, and, inside, O’Reilly⁠—baptismal name Luigi Orelli⁠—was waiting.</p>
				<p>“Chief wants to see you, right away,” the saloon keeper said.</p>
				<p>The brewer nodded. “All right. Keep me covered; don’t know how long I’ll be.” He crossed the room and opened a corner-cupboard, stepping inside.</p>
				<p>The corner cupboard, which was an elevator, took him to a tunnel below the street. Across the street, he entered another elevator, set the indicator for the tenth floor, and ascended. As the car rose, he could feel the personality of Frank Cardon, Illiterate brewer, drop from him, as though he were an actor returning from the stage to his dressing room.</p>
				<p>The room into which he emerged was almost that. There was a long table, at which two white-smocked Literates drank coffee and went over some papers; a third Literate sprawled in a deep chair, resting; at a small table, four men in black shirts and leather breeches and field boots played poker, while a fifth, who had just entered and had not yet removed his leather helmet and jacket or his weapons belt, stood watching them.</p>
				<p>Cardon went to a row of lockers along the wall, opened one, and took out a white smock, pulling it over his head and zipping it up to the throat. Then he buckled on a Sam Browne with its tablet holster and stylus gas projector. The Literate sprawling in the chair opened one eye.</p>
				<p>“Hi, Frank. Feels good to have them on again, doesn’t it?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Clean,” Cardon replied. “It’ll be just for half an hour, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>He passed through the door across from the elevator, went down a short hall, and spoke in greeting to the leather-jacketed storm trooper on guard outside the door at the other end.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon,” the guard nodded. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lancedale’s expecting you.”</p>
				<p>“So I understand, Bert.”</p>
				<p>He opened the door and went through. William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lancedale rose from behind his desk and advanced to greet him with a quick handshake, guiding him to a chair beside the desk. As he did, he sniffed and raised an eyebrow.</p>
				<p>“Beer this early, Frank?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Morning, noon, and night, chief,” Cardon replied. “When you said this job was going to be dangerous, I didn’t know you meant that it would lead straight to an alcoholic’s grave.”</p>
				<p>“Let me get you a cup of coffee, and a cigar, then.” The white-haired Literate executive resumed his seat, passing a hand back and forth slowly across the face of the commo, the diamond on his finger twinkling, and gave brief instructions. “And just relax, for a minute. You have a tough job, this time, Frank.”</p>
				<p>They were both silent as a novice Literate bustled in with coffee and individually-sealed cigars.</p>
				<p>“At least, you’re not one of these plain-living-and-right-thinking fanatics, like Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves,” Cardon said. “On top of everything else, that I could not take.”</p>
				<p>Lancedale’s thin face broke into a smile, little wrinkles putting his mouth in parentheses. Cardon sampled the coffee, and then used a Sixteenth Century Italian stiletto from Lancedale’s desk to perforate the end of his cigar.</p>
				<p>“Much as I hate it, I’ll have to get out of here as soon as I can,” he said. “I don’t know how long O’Reilly can keep me covered, down at the tavern⁠—”</p>
				<p>Lancedale nodded. “Well, how are things going, then?”</p>
				<p>“First of all, the brewery,” Cardon began.</p>
				<p>Lancedale consigned the brewery to perdition. “That’s just your cover; any money it makes is purely irrelevant. How about the election?”</p>
				<p>“Pelton’s in,” Cardon said. “As nearly in as any candidate ever was before the polls opened. Three months ago, the Independents were as solid as Gibraltar used to be. Today, they look like Gibraltar after that <abbr>H</abbr>-bomb hit it. The only difference is, they don’t know what hit them, yet.”</p>
				<p>“Hamilton’s campaign manager does,” Lancedale said. “Did you hear his telecast, this morning?”</p>
				<p>Cardon shook his head. Lancedale handed over a little half-inch, thirty-minute, record disk.</p>
				<p>“All you need is the first three or four minutes,” he said. “The rest of it is repetition.”</p>
				<p>Cardon put the disk in his pocket recorder and set it for playback, putting the plug in his ear. After a while, he shut it off and took out the ear plug.</p>
				<p>“That’s bad! What are we going to do about it?”</p>
				<p>Lancedale shrugged. “What are you going to do?” he countered. “You’re Pelton’s campaign manager⁠—Heaven pity him.”</p>
				<p>Cardon thought for a moment. “We’ll play it for laughs,” he decided. “Some of our semantics experts could make the joke of the year out of it by the time the polls open tomorrow. The Fraternities bribing their worst enemy to attack them, so that he can ruin their business; who’s been listening to a tape of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Alice in Wonderland</i> at Independent-Conservative headquarters?”</p>
				<p>“That would work,” Lancedale agreed. “And we can count on our friends Joyner and Graves to give you every possible assistance with their customary bull-in-a-china-shop tactics. I suppose you’ve seen these posters they’ve been plastering around: <q>If you can read this, Chester Pelton is your sworn enemy! A vote for Pelton is a vote for your own enslavement!</q>”</p>
				<p>“Naturally. And have you seen the telecast we’ve been using⁠—a view of it, with a semantically correct spoken paraphrase?”</p>
				<p>Lancedale nodded. “And I’ve also noticed that those posters have been acquiring different obscene crayon-drawings, too. That’s just typical of the short-range Joyner-Graves mentality. Why, they’ve made more votes for Pelton than he’s made for himself. Is it any wonder we’re convinced that people like that aren’t to be trusted to formulate the future policy of the Fraternities?”</p>
				<p>“Well⁠ ⁠… they’ve proved themselves wrong. I wonder, though, if we can prove ourselves right, in the long run. There are times when this thing scares me, chief. If anything went wrong⁠—”</p>
				<p>“What, for instance?”</p>
				<p>“Somebody could get to Pelton.” Cardon made a stabbing gesture with the stiletto, which he still held. “Maybe you don’t really know how hot this thing’s gotten. What we had to cut out of Mongery’s report, this morning⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I’ve been keeping in touch,” Lancedale understated gently.</p>
				<p>“Well then. If anything happened to Pelton, there wouldn’t be a Literate left alive in this city twelve hours later. And I question whether or not Graves and Joyner know that.”</p>
				<p>“I think they do. If they don’t, it’s not because I’ve failed to point it out to them. Of course, there are the Independent-Conservative grafters; a lot of them are beginning to hear jail doors opening for them, and they’re scared. But I think routine body-guarding ought to protect Pelton from them, or from any isolated fanatics.”</p>
				<p>“And there is also the matter of Pelton’s daughter, and his son,” Cardon said. “We know, and Graves and Joyner know, and I assume that Slade Gardner knows, that they can both read and write as well as any Literate in the Fraternities. Suppose that got out between now and the election?”</p>
				<p>“And that could not only hurt Pelton, but it would expose the work we’ve been doing in the schools,” Lancedale added. “And even inside the Fraternities, that would raise the devil. Joyner and Graves don’t begin to realize how far we’ve gone with that. They could kick up a simply hideous row about it!”</p>
				<p>“And if Pelton found out that his kids are Literates⁠—<em>Woooo!</em>” Cardon grimaced. “Or what we’ve been doing to him. I hope I’m not around when that happens. I’m beginning to like the cantankerous old bugger.”</p>
				<p>“I was afraid of that,” Lancedale said. “Well, don’t let it interfere with what you have to do. Remember, Frank; the Plan has to come first, always.”</p>
				<p>He walked with O’Reilly to the street door, talking about tomorrow’s election; after shaking hands with the saloon keeper, he crossed the sidewalk and stepped onto the beltway, moving across the strips until he came to the twenty <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">m.p.h.</abbr> strip. The tall office buildings of upper Yonkers Borough marched away as he stood on the strip, appreciatively puffing at Lancedale’s cigar. The character of the street changed; the buildings grew lower, and the quiet and fashionable ground-floor shops and cafés gave place to bargain stores, their audio-advertisers whooping urgently about improbable prices and offerings, and garish, noisy, crowded bars and cafeterias blaring recorded popular music. There was quite a bit of political advertising in evidence⁠—huge pictures of the two major senatorial candidates. He estimated that Chester Pelton’s bald head and bulldog features appeared twice for every one of Grant Hamilton’s white locks, old-fashioned spectacles and self-satisfied smirk.</p>
				<p>Then he came to the building on which he had parked his ’copter, and left the beltway, entering and riding up to the landing stage on the helical escalator. There seemed to have been some trouble; about a dozen Independent-Conservative storm troopers, in their white robes and hoods, with the fiery-cross emblem on their breasts, were bunched together, most of them with their right hands inside their bosoms, while a similar group of Radical-Conservative storm troopers, with their black sombreros and little black masks, stood watching them and fingering the white-handled pistols they wore in pairs on their belts. Between the two groups were four city policemen, looking acutely unhappy.</p>
				<p>The group in the Lone Ranger uniforms, he saw, were standing in front of a huge tri-dimensional animated portrait of Chester Pelton. As he watched, the pictured candidate raised a clenched fist, and Pelton’s recorded and amplified voice thundered:</p>
				<p>“<em>Put the Literates in their place! Our servants, not our masters!</em>”</p>
				<p>He recognized the group leader of the Radical-Socialists⁠—the masks were too small to be more than token disguises⁠—and beckoned to him, at the same time walking toward his ’copter. The man in black with the white-handled pistols followed him, spurs jingling.</p>
				<p>“Hello, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon,” he said, joining him. “Nothing to it. We got a tip they were coming to sabotage Big Brother, over there. Take out our sound-recording, and put in one of their own, like they did over in Queens, last week. The town clowns got here in time to save everybody’s face, so there wasn’t any shooting. We’re staying put till they go, though.”</p>
				<p>“<em>Put the Literates in their place! Our servants, not our masters!</em>” the huge tridianimate bellowed.</p>
				<p>Over in Queens, the Independents had managed to get at a similar tridianimate, had taken out the record, and had put in one: <q>I am a lying fraud! Vote for Grant Hamilton and liberty and sound government!</q></p>
				<p>“Smart work, Goodkin,” he approved. “Don’t let any of your boys start the gunplay. The city cops are beginning to get wise to who’s going to win the election, tomorrow, but don’t antagonize them. But if any of those Ku Kluxers tries to pull a gun, don’t waste time trying to wing him. Just hold on to that fiery something-or-other on his chest and let him have it, and let the coroner worry about him.”</p>
				<p>“Yeah. With pleasure,” Goodkin replied. “You know, that nightshirt thing they wear is about the stupidest idea for a storm-troop uniform I ever saw. Natural target in a gunfight, and in a rough-and-tumble it gets them all tangled up. Ah, there go a couple of coppers to talk to them; that’s what they’ve been waiting on. Now they can beat it without looking like they been run out by our gang.”</p>
				<p>Cardon nodded. “Tell your boys to stay around for a while; they may expect you to leave right after they do, and then they’ll try to slip back. You did a good job; got here promptly. Be seeing you, Goodkin.”</p>
				<p>He climbed into his own ’copter and started the motor.</p>
				<p>“<em>Put the Literates in their place!</em>” the tri-dimensional colossus roared triumphantly after the retreating Independents. “<em>Our servants, not our masters!</em>”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>At eight thousand, he got the ’copter onto the lower Manhattan beam and relaxed. First of all, he’d have to do something about answering Slade Gardner’s telecast propaganda. That stuff was dangerous. The answer ought to go on the air by noon, and should be stepped up through the afternoon. First as a straight news story; Elliot Mongery had fifteen minutes, beginning at 1215⁠—no, that wouldn’t do. Mongery’s sponsor for that time was Atomflame Heaters, and Atomflame was a subsidiary of Canada Northwest Fissionables, and Canada Northwest was umbilicus-deep in that Kettle River lease graft that Pelton had sworn to get investigated as soon as he took office. Professional ethics wouldn’t allow Mongery to say anything in Pelton’s behalf on Atomflame’s time. Well, there was Guthrie Parham, he came on at 1245, and his sponsor was all right. He’d call Parham and tell him what he wanted done.</p>
				<p>The buzzer warned him that he was approaching the lower Manhattan beacon; he shifted to manual control, dropped down to the three-thousand-foot level, and set his selector beam for the signal from Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise. Down toward the tip of the island, in the section that had been rebuilt after that Stalin Mark <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span> guided missile had gotten through the counter-rocket defenses in 1987, he could see the quadrate cross of his goal, with public landing stages on each of the four arms, and the higher central block with its landing stage for freight and store personnel. Above the four public stages, helicopters swarmed like May flies⁠—May flies which had mutated and invented ritual or military drill or choreography⁠—coming in in four streams to the tips of the arms and rising vertically from the middle. There was about ten times the normal amount of traffic for this early in the morning. He wondered, briefly, then remembered, and cursed. That infernal sale!</p>
				<p>Grudgingly, he respected Russell Latterman’s smartness, and in consequence, the ability of Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves in selecting a good agent to plant in Pelton’s store. Latterman gave a plausible impersonation of the Illiterate businessman, loyal Prime Minister of Pelton’s commercial empire, Generalissimo in the perpetual war against Macy &amp; Gimbel’s. From that viewpoint, the sale was excellent business⁠—Latterman had gotten the jump on all the other department stores for the winter fashions and fall sports trade. He had also turned the store into a madhouse at the exact time when Chester Pelton needed to give all his attention to the election.</p>
				<p>Pressing the button that put on his private recognition signal, he rose above the incoming customers and began to drop toward the private landing stage, circling to get a view of the other four stages. Maybe the sale could be turned to some advantage, at that. A free souvenir with each purchase, carrying a Pelton-for-Senator picture-message⁠—</p>
				<p>He broke off, peering down at the five-hundred-foot-square landing stage above the central block, then brought his ’copter swooping down rapidly. The white-clad figures he had seen swarming up the helical escalator were not wearing the Ku Klux robes of the Independent-Conservative storm troops, as he had first feared⁠—they were in Literate smocks, and among them were the black leather jackets and futuristic helmets of their guards. They were led, he saw, by Stephen <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Bayne, the store’s Chief Literate; with him were his assistant, Literate Third Class Roger <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">B.</abbr> Feinberg, and the novices carrying books and briefcases and cased typewriters, and the guards, and every Literate employed in the store. Four or five men in ordinarily vivid-colored business suits were obviously expostulating about something. As he landed and threw back the transparent canopy, he could hear a babel of voices, above which Feinberg was crying: “Unfair! Unfair! Unfair to Organized Literacy!”</p>
				<p>He jumped out and hurried over.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“But you simply can’t!” a white-haired man in blue-and-orange business clothes was protesting. “If you do, the Associated Fraternities’ll be liable for losses we incur; you know that!”</p>
				<p>Bayne, his thin face livid with anger⁠—and also, Cardon noticed, with what looked like a couple of fresh bruises⁠—ignored him. Feinberg broke off his chant of “Unfair! Unfair!” long enough to answer:</p>
				<p>“A Literate First Class has been brutally assaulted by the Illiterate owner of this store. Literate service for this store is, accordingly, being discontinued, pending a decision by the Grand Council of the local Fraternity.”</p>
				<p>Cardon grabbed the blue-and-orange clad man and dragged him to one side.</p>
				<p>“What happened, Hutschnecker?” he demanded.</p>
				<p>“They’re walking out on us,” Hutschnecker told him, unnecessarily. “The boss had a fight with Bayne; knocked him down a couple of times. Bayne tried to pull his tablet gun, and I grabbed it away from him, and somebody else grabbed Pelton before he could pull his, and a couple of store cops got all the other Literates in the office covered. Then Bayne put on the general-address system and began calling out the Literates⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Yes, but why did Pelton beat Bayne up?”</p>
				<p>“Bayne made a pass at Miss Claire. I wasn’t there when it happened; she came into the office⁠—”</p>
				<p>Cardon felt his face tighten into a frown of perplexity. That wasn’t like Literate First Class Stephen <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Bayne. He made quite a hobby of pinching salesgirls behind the counter which was one thing; the boss’ daughter was quite another.</p>
				<p>“Where’s Latterman?” he asked, looking around.</p>
				<p>“Down in the office, with the others, trying to help <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton. He’s had another of those heart attacks⁠—”</p>
				<p>Cardon swore and ran for the descending escalator, running down the rotating spiral to the executive floor and jumping off into the gawking mob of Illiterate clerks crowded in the open doors of Pelton’s office. He hit and shoved and elbowed and cursed them out of the way, and burst into the big room beyond, and then, for a moment, he was almost sorry he had come.</p>
				<p>Pelton was slumped in his big relaxer chair, his face pale and twisted in pain, his breath coming in feeble gasps. His daughter was beside him, her blond head bent over him; Russell Latterman was standing to one side, watching intently. For an instant, Cardon was reminded of a tomcat watching a promising mouse hole.</p>
				<p>“Claire!” Cardon exploded, “give him a nitrocaine bulb. Why are you all just standing around?”</p>
				<p>Claire turned. “There are none,” she said, looking at him with desperate eyes. “The box is empty; he must have used them all.”</p>
				<p>He shot a quick glance at Latterman, catching the sales manager before he could erase a look of triumph from his face. Things began to add up. Latterman, of course, was the undercover man for Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves and the rest of the Conservative faction at Literates’ Hall, just as he, himself, was Lancedale’s agent. Obsessed with immediate advantages and disadvantages, the Joyner-Graves faction wanted to secure the reelection of Grant Hamilton, and the way things had been going in the past two months, only Chester Pelton’s death could accomplish that. Latterman had probably thrown out Pelton’s nitrocaine capsules and then put Bayne up to insulting Pelton’s daughter, knowing that a fit of rage would bring on another heart attack, which could be fatal without the medicine.</p>
				<p>“Well, send for more!”</p>
				<p>“The prescription’s in the safe,” she said faintly.</p>
				<p>The office safe was locked, and only a Literate could open it. The double combination was neatly stenciled on the door, the numbers spelled out as words and the letters spelled in phonetic equivalents. All three of them⁠—himself, Claire, and Russell Latterman⁠—could read them. None of them dared admit it. Latterman was fairly licking his chops in anticipation. If Cardon opened the safe, Pelton’s campaign manager stood convicted as a Literate. If Claire opened it, the gaggle of Illiterate clerks in the doorway would see, and speedily spread the news, that the daughter of the arch-foe of Literacy was herself able to read. Maybe Latterman hadn’t really intended his employer to die. Maybe this was the situation he had really intended to contrive.</p>
				<p>Chester Pelton couldn’t be allowed to die. If Grant Hamilton were returned to the Senate, the long-range planning of William Lancedale would suffer a crushing setback, and the public reaction would be catastrophic. <q>The Plan comes first</q>, Lancedale had told him. He made his decision, and then saw that he hadn’t needed to make it. Claire had straightened, left her father, crossed quickly to the safe, and was kneeling in front of it, her back stiff with determination, her fingers busy at the dials, her eyes going from them to the printed combination and back again. She swung open the door, skimmed through the papers inside, unerringly selected the prescription, and rose.</p>
				<p>“Here, Russ; go get it filled at once,” she ordered. “And hurry!”</p>
				<p>Oh, no, you don’t, Cardon thought. One chance is enough for you, Russ. He snatched the prescription from her and turned to Latterman.</p>
				<p>“I’ll get it,” he told the sales manager. “You’re needed for the sale; stay on the job here.”</p>
				<p>“But with the Literates walked out, we can’t⁠—”</p>
				<p>Cardon blazed: “Do I have to teach you your business? Have a sample of each item set aside at the counter, and pile sales slips under it. And for unique items, just detach the tag and put it with the sales slip. Now get out of here, and get cracking with it!” He picked up the pistol that had been taken from Pelton when he had tried to draw it on Bayne, checking the chamber and setting the safety. “Know how to use this?” he asked Claire. “Then hang onto it, and stay close to your father. This wasn’t any accident, it was a deliberate attempt on his life. I’ll have a couple of store cops sent in here; see that they stay with you.”</p>
				<p>He gave her no chance to argue. Pushing Latterman ahead of him, he drove through the mob of clerks outside the door.</p>
				<p>“… Course she can; didn’t you see her open the safe?” he heard. “… Nobody but a Literate⁠—” “Then she’s a Literate, herself!”</p>
				<p>A couple of centuries ago, they would have talked like that if it had been discovered that the girl were pregnant; a couple of centuries before that, they would have been equally horrified if she had been discovered to have been a Protestant, or a Catholic, or whatever the locally unpopular religion happened to be. By noon, this would be all over Penn-Jersey-York; coming on top of Slade Gardner’s accusations⁠—</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>He ran up the spiral escalator, stumbling and regaining his footing as he left it. Bayne and his striking Literates were all gone; he saw a sergeant of Pelton’s store police and went toward him, taking his spare identity-badge from his pocket.</p>
				<p>“Here,” he said, handing it to the sergeant. “Get another officer, and go down to Pelton’s office. Show it to Miss Pelton, and tell her I sent you. There’s been an attempt on Chester Pelton’s life; you’re to stay with him. Use your own judgment, but don’t let anybody, and that definitely includes Russell Latterman, get at him. If you see anything suspicious, shoot first and ask questions afterwards. What’s your name, sergeant?”</p>
				<p>“Coccozello, sir. Guido Coccozello.”</p>
				<p>“All right. There’ll be a medic or a pharmacist⁠—a Literate, anyhow⁠—with medicine for <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton. He’ll ask for you, by name, and mention me. And there’ll be another Literate, maybe; he’ll know your name, and use mine. Hurry, now, sergeant.”</p>
				<p>He jumped into his ’copter, pulled forward the plexiglass canopy, and took off vertically to ten thousand feet, then, orienting himself, swooped downward toward a landing stage on the other side of the East River, cutting across traffic levels with an utter contempt for regulations.</p>
				<p>The building on which he landed was one of the principal pharmacies; he spiraled down on the escalator to the main floor and went directly to the Literate in charge, noticing that he wore on his Sam Browne not only the badges of retail-merchandising, pharmacist and graduate chemist but also that of medic-in-training. Snatching a pad and pencil from a counter, he wrote hastily: <q>Your private office, at once; urgent and important.</q></p>
				<p>Looking at it, the Literate nodded in recognition of Cardon’s Literacy.</p>
				<p>“Over this way, sir,” he said, guiding Cardon to his small cubicle office.</p>
				<p>“Here.” Cardon gave him the prescription. “Nitrocaine bulbs. They’re for Chester Pelton; he’s had a serious heart attack. He needs these with all speed. I don’t suppose I need tell you how many kinds of hell will break loose if he dies now and the Fraternities are accused, as the Illiterates’ Organization will be sure to, of having had him poisoned.”</p>
				<p>“Who are you?” the Literate asked, taking the prescription and glancing at it. “That,”⁠—he gestured toward Cardon’s silver-laced black Mexican jacket⁠—“isn’t exactly a white smock.”</p>
				<p>Cardon had his pocket recorder in his hand. He held it out, pressing a concealed stud; the stylus-and-tablet insignia glowed redly on it for a moment, then vanished. The uniformed Literate nodded.</p>
				<p>“Fill this exactly; better do it yourself, to make sure, and take it over to Pelton’s yourself. I see you have a medic-trainee’s badge. Ask for Sergeant Coccozello, and tell him Frank Cardon sent you.” The Literate, who had not recognized him before, opened his eyes at the name and whistled softly. “And fix up a sedative to keep him quiet for not less than four nor more than six hours. Let me use your visiphone for a while, if you please.”</p>
				<p>The man in the Literate smock nodded and hurried out. Cardon dialed William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lancedale’s private number. When Lancedale’s thin, intense face appeared on the screen, he reported swiftly.</p>
				<p>“The way I estimate it,” he finished, “Latterman put Bayne up to making a pass at the girl, after having thrown out Pelton’s nitrocaine bulbs. Probably told the silly jerk that Claire was pining away with secret passion for him, or something. Maybe he wanted to kill Pelton; maybe he just wanted this to happen.”</p>
				<p>“I assume there’s no chance of stopping a leak?”</p>
				<p>Cardon laughed with mirthless harshness. “That, I take it, was rhetorical.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, of course.” Lancedale’s face assumed the blank expression that went with a pause for semantic re-integration. “Can you cover yourself for about an hour?”</p>
				<p>“Certainly. ’Copter trouble. Visits to campaign headquarters. An appeal on Pelton’s behalf for a new crew of Literates for the store⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Good enough. Come over. I think I can see a way to turn this to advantage. I’m going to call for an emergency session of the Grand Council this afternoon, and I’ll want you sitting in on it; I want to talk to you about plans now.” He considered for a moment. “There’s too much of a crowd at O’Reilly’s, now; come the church way.”</p>
				<p>Breaking the connection, Cardon dialed again. A girl’s face, over a Literate Third Class smock, appeared in the screen; a lovely golden voice chimed at him:</p>
				<p>“Mineola High School; good morning, sir.”</p>
				<p>“Good morning. Frank Cardon here. Let me talk, at once, to your principal, Literate First Class Prestonby.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Ralph Prestonby cleared his throat, slipped a master disk into the recording machine beside his desk, and pressed the start button.</p>
				<p>“Dear Parent or Guardian,” he began. “Your daughter, now a third-year student at this school, has reached the age of eligibility for the Domestic Science course entitled, ‘How To Win and Hold a Husband.’ Statistics show that girls who have completed this valuable course are sooner, longer, and happier married than those who have not enjoyed its advantages. We recommend it most highly.</p>
				<p>“However, because of the delicate nature of some of the visual material used, your consent is required. You can attach such consent to this disk by running it for at least ten seconds after the sign-off and then switching from ‘Play’ to ‘Transcribe.’ Kindly include your full name, as well as your daughter’s, and place your thumbprint on the opposite side of the disk. Very sincerely yours, Literate First Class Ralph <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Prestonby, Principal.”</p>
				<p>He put the master disk in an envelope, checked over a list of names and addresses of parents and girl students, and put that in also. He looked over the winter sports schedule, and signed and thumbprinted it. Then he loaded the recorder with his morning’s mail, switched to “Play,” and started it. As he listened, he blew smoke rings across the room and toyed with a dagger, made from a file, which had been thrown down the central light-well at him a few days before. The invention of the pocket recorder, which put a half-hour’s conversation on a half-inch disk, had done more to slow down business and promote inane correspondence than anything since the earlier inventions of shorthand, typewriters and pretty stenographers. Finally, he cleared the machine, dumping the whole mess into a basket and carrying it out to his secretary.</p>
				<p>“Miss Collins, take this infernal rubbish and have a couple of the girls divide it between them, play it off, and make a digest of it,” he said. “And here. The sports schedule, and this parental-consent thing on the husband-trapping course. Have them taken care of.”</p>
				<p>“This stuff,” Martha Collins said, poking at the pile of letter disks. “I suppose about half of it is threats, abuse and obscenities, and the other half is from long-winded bores with idiotic suggestions and ill-natured gripes. I’ll use that old tag line, again⁠—‘hoping you appreciate our brevity as much as we enjoyed yours⁠—’ ”</p>
				<p>“Yes. That’ll be all right.” He looked at his watch. “I’m going to make a personal building-tour, instead of using the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>. The animals are sort of restless, today. The election; the infantile compulsion to take sides. If you need me for anything urgent, don’t use oral call. Just flash my signal, red-blue-red-blue, on the hall and classroom screens. Oh, Doug!”</p>
				<p>Yetsko, his length of rubber hose under his arm, ambled out of Prestonby’s private office, stopping to stub out his cigarette. The action reminded Prestonby that he still had his pipe in his mouth; he knocked it out and pocketed it. Together, they went into the hall outside.</p>
				<p>“Where to, first, captain?” Yetsko wanted to know.</p>
				<p>“Cloak-and-Dagger Department, on the top floor. Then we’ll drop down to the shops, and then up through Domestic Science and Business and General Arts.”</p>
				<p>“And back here. We hope,” Yetsko finished.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>They took a service elevator to the top floor, emerging into a stockroom piled with boxes and crates and cases of sound records and cans of film and stacks of picture cards, and all the other impedimenta of Illiterate education. Passing through it to the other end, Prestonby unlocked a door, and they went down a short hall, to where ten or fifteen boys and girls had just gotten off a helical escalator and were queued up at a door at the other end. There were two Literate guards in black leather, and a student-monitor, with his white belt and rubber truncheon, outside the door.</p>
				<p>Prestonby swore under his breath. He’d hoped they’d miss this, but since they hadn’t, there was nothing for it but to fall in at the tail of the queue. One by one, the boys and girls went up, spoke briefly to the guards and the student-monitor, and were passed through the door, Each time, one of the guards had to open it with a key. Finally, it was Prestonby’s turn.</p>
				<p>“B, D, F, H, J, L, N, P, R, T, V, X, Y,” he recited to the guardians of the door.</p>
				<p>“A, C, E, G, I, K, M, O, Q, S, U, W, Y,” the monitor replied solemnly. “The inkwell is dry, and the book is dusty.”</p>
				<p>“But tomorrow, there will be writing and reading for all,” Prestonby answered.</p>
				<p>The guard with the key unlocked the door, and he and Yetsko went through, into an utterly silent soundproofed room, and from it into an inner, noisy, room, where a recorded voice was chanting:</p>
				<p>“Hat⁠—<em>huh-ah-tuh.</em> H-a-t. Box⁠—<em>buh-oh-ksss</em>. B-o-x. Gun⁠—<em>guh-uh-nnn</em>. G-u-n. Girl⁠—<em>guh-ih-rrr-lll</em>,” while pictures were flashed on a screen at the front, and words appeared under them.</p>
				<p>There were about twenty boys and girls, of the freshman-year age-bracket at desk-seats, facing the screen. They’d started learning the alphabet when school had opened in September; now they had gotten as far as combining letters into simple words. In another month, they’d be as far as diphthongs and would be initiated into the mysteries of silent letters. Maybe sooner than that; he was finding that children who had not been taught to read until their twelfth year learned much more rapidly than the primary grade children in the Literate schools.</p>
				<p>What he was doing here wasn’t exactly illegal. It wasn’t even against the strict letter of Fraternity regulations. But it had to be done clandestinely. What he’d have liked to have done would have been to have given every boy and girl in English I the same instruction this selected group was getting, but that would have been out of the question. The public would never have stood for it; the police would have had to intervene to prevent a riotous mob of Illiterates from tearing the school down brick by brick, and even if that didn’t happen, the ensuing uproar inside the Fraternity would have blown the roof off Literates’ Hall. Even Lancedale couldn’t have survived such an explosion, and the body of Literate First Class Ralph <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">N.</abbr> Prestonby would have been found in a vacant lot the next morning. Even many of Lancedale’s supporters would have turned on him in anger at this sudden blow to the Fraternities’ monopoly of the printed word.</p>
				<p>So it had to be kept secret, and since adolescents in possession of a secret are under constant temptation to hint mysteriously in the presence of outsiders, this hocus-pocus of ritual and password and countersign had to be resorted to. He’d been in conspiratorial work of other kinds, and knew that there was a sound psychological basis for most of what seemed, at first glance, to be mere melodramatic claptrap.</p>
				<p>He and Yetsko passed on through a door across the room, into another soundproofed room. The work of soundproofing and partitioning the old stockroom had been done in the last semester of his first year at Mineola High, by members of the graduating class of building-trades students, who had then gone their several ways convinced that they had been working on a set of music-class practice rooms. The Board of Education had never even found out about it. In this second room, a Literate teacher, one of the Lancedale faction, had a reading class of twenty-five or thirty. A girl was on her feet, with a book in her hand, reading from it:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>“We are not sure of sorrow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">And joy was never sure;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Today will die tomorrow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Time stoops to no man’s lure;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And love, grown faint and fretful</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lips but half regretful</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sighs, and with eyes forgetful</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">Weeps that no loves endure.”</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Then she handed the book⁠—it was the only copy⁠—to the boy sitting in front of her, and he rose to read the next verse. Prestonby, catching the teacher’s eye, nodded and smiled. This was a third-year class, of course, but from h-a-t spells hat to Swinburne in three years was good work.</p>
				<p>There were three other classes, a total of little over a hundred students. There was no trouble; they were there for one purpose only⁠—to learn. He spoke with one of the teachers, whose class was busy with a written exercise; he talked for a while to another whose only duty at the moment was to answer questions and furnish help to a small class who were reading silently from a variety of smuggled-in volumes.</p>
				<p>“Only a hundred and twenty, out of five thousand,” Yetsko said to him, as they were dropping down in the elevator by which they had come. “Think you’ll ever really get anything done with them?”</p>
				<p>“I won’t. Maybe they won’t,” he replied. “But the ones they’ll teach will. They’re just a cadre; it’ll take fifty years before the effects are really felt. But some day⁠—”</p>
				<p>The shops⁠—a good half of the school was trades-training⁠—were noisy and busy. Here Prestonby kept his hand on his gas-projector, and Yetsko had his rubber hose ready, either to strike or to discard in favor of his pistol. The instructors were similarly on the alert and ready for trouble⁠—he had seen penitentiaries where the guards took it easier. Carpentry and building trades. Machine shop. Welding. ’Copter and <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> repair shops⁠—he made a minor and relatively honest graft there, from the sale of rebuilt equipment. Even an atomic-equipment shop, though there was nothing in the place that would excite a Geiger more than the instructor’s luminous-dial watch.</p>
				<p>Domestic Science⁠—Home Decorating, Home Handicrafts, Use of Home Appliances, Beautician School, Charm School. He and Yetsko sampled the products of the Cooking School, intended for the cafeteria, and found them edible if uninspired.</p>
				<p>Business⁠—classes in recording letters, using Illiterate business-machines, preparing Illiterate cards for same, filing recordings⁠—always with the counsel, “When in doubt, consult a Literate.”</p>
				<p>General Arts⁠—Spanish and French, from elaborate record players, the progeny of the old Twentieth Century Linguaphone. English, with recorded-speech composition, enunciation training, semantics, and what Prestonby called English Illiterature. The class he visited was drowsing through one of the less colorful sections of “Gone With The Wind.” World History, with half the students frankly asleep through an audiovisual on the Feudal System, with planted hints on how nice a revival of same would be, and identifying the clergy of the Middle Ages with the Fraternities of Literates. American History, with the class wide awake, since Custer’s Massacre was obviously only moments away.</p>
				<p>“Wantta bet one of those little cherubs doesn’t try to scalp another before the day’s out?” Yetsko whispered.</p>
				<p>Prestonby shook his head. “No bet. Remember that film on the Spanish Inquisition, that we had to discontinue?”</p>
				<p>It was then that the light on the classroom screen, which had been flickering green and white, suddenly began flashing Prestonby’s wanted-at-office signal.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Prestonby found Frank Cardon looking out of the screen in his private office. The round, ordinarily cheerful, face was serious, but the innocent blue eyes were as unreadable as ever. He was wearing one of the new Mexican <em>charro</em>-style jackets, black laced with silver.</p>
				<p>“I can’t see all your office, Ralph,” he said as Prestonby approached. “Are you alone?”</p>
				<p>“Doug Yetsko’s all,” Prestonby said, and, as Cardon hesitated, added: “Don’t be silly, Frank; he’s my bodyguard. What could I be in that he wouldn’t know all about?”</p>
				<p>Cardon nodded. “Well, we’re in a jam up to here.” A handwave conveyed the impression that the sea of troubles had risen to his chin. He spoke at some length, describing the fight between Chester Pelton and Stephen <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Bayne, the Literate strike at Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise, Pelton’s heart attack, and the circumstances of Claire’s opening the safe. “So you see,” he finished. “Maybe Latterman tried to kill Pelton, maybe he just tried to do what he did. I can’t take chances either way.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby thought furiously. “You say Claire’s alone at the store with her father?”</p>
				<p>“And a couple of store cops, sterling characters with the hearts of lions and the brains of goldfish,” Cardon replied. “And Russ Latterman, and maybe four or five Conservative goons he’s managed to infiltrate into the store.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby was still thinking, aloud, now. “Maybe they did mean to kill Pelton; in that case, they’ll try again. Or maybe they only wanted to expose Claire’s literacy. It’s hard to say what else they’d try⁠—maybe kidnap her, to truth-drug her and use her as a guest-artist on a Conservative telecast. I’m going over to the store, now.”</p>
				<p>“That’s a good idea, Ralph. If you hadn’t thought of it, I was going to suggest it. Land on the central stage, ask for Sergeant Coccozello of the store police, and give my name. Even aside from everything else, it’d be a good idea to have somebody there who can read and dares admit it, till a new crew of Literates can get there. You were speaking about the possibility of kidnapping; how about the boy? Ray?”</p>
				<p>Prestonby nodded. “I’ll have him come here to my office, and stay there till I get back; I’ll have Yetsko stay with him.” He turned to where the big man in black leather stood guard at the door. “Doug, go get Ray Pelton and bring him here. Check with Miss Collins for where he’d be, now.” He turned back to the screen. “Anything else, Frank?”</p>
				<p>“Isn’t that enough?” the brewer-Literate demanded. “I’ll call you at the store, after a while. ’Bye.”</p>
				<p>The screen darkened as Cardon broke the connection. Prestonby got to his feet, went to his desk, and picked up a pipe, digging out the ashes from the bowl with an ice pick that one of the teachers had taken from a sixteen-year-old would-be murderer. He checked his tablet gun, made sure that there was an extra loaded clip in the holster, and got two more spare clips from the arms locker. Then, to make sure, he called Pelton’s store, talking for a while to the police sergeant Cardon had mentioned. By the time he was finished, the door opened and Yetsko ushered Ray Pelton in.</p>
				<p>“What’s happened?” the boy asked. “Doug told me that the Senator⁠ ⁠… my father⁠ ⁠… had another heart attack.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, Ray. I don’t believe he’s in any great danger. He’s at the store, resting in his office.” He went on to tell the boy what had happened, exactly and in full detail. He was only fifteen, but already he had completed the four-year reading course and he could think a great deal more logically than seventy percent of the people who were legally entitled to vote. Ray listened seriously, and proved Prestonby’s confidence justified by nodding.</p>
				<p>“Frame-up,” he said succinctly. “Stinks like a glue factory of a put-up job. Something’s going to happen to Russ Latterman, one of these days.”</p>
				<p>“I think you’d better let Frank Cardon take care of him, Ray,” Prestonby advised. “I think there are more angles to this than he told me. Now, I’m going over to the store. Somebody’s got to stay with Claire. I want you to stay here, in this room. If anybody sends you any message supposed to be from me, just ignore it. It’ll be a trap. If I want to get in touch with you, I’ll call you, with vision-image.”</p>
				<p>“Mean somebody might try to kidnap me, or Claire, to force the Senator to withdraw, or something?” Ray asked, his eyes widening.</p>
				<p>“You catch on quickly, Ray,” Prestonby commended him. “Doug, you stay with Ray till I get back. Don’t let him out of your sight for an instant. At noon, have Miss Collins get lunches for both of you sent up; if I’m not back by fifteen-hundred, take him to his home, and stay with him there.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>For half an hour, Frank Cardon made a flying tour of Radical-Socialist borough headquarters. Even at the Manhattan headquarters, which he visited immediately after his talk with Prestonby, the news had already gotten out. The atmosphere of optimistic triumph which had undoubtedly followed Mongery’s telecast and his report on the Trotter Poll, had evaporated. The Literate clerical help was gathered in a tight knot, obviously a little worried, and just as obviously enjoying the reaction. In smaller and constantly changing groups, the volunteers, the paid helpers, the dirt-squirters, the goon gangs, gathered, talking in worried or frightened or angry voices. When Cardon entered and was recognized, there was a concerted movement toward him. His two regular bodyguards, both on leave from the Literate storm troops, moved quickly to range themselves on either side of him. With a gesture, he halted the others.</p>
				<p>“Hold it!” he called. “I know what you’re worried about. I was there when it happened, and saw everything.”</p>
				<p>He paused, to let them assimilate that, and continued: “Now get this, all of you! Our boss, and⁠—<em>if he lives</em>⁠—our next senator, was the victim of a deliberate murder attempt, by Literate First Class Bayne, who threw out his supply of nitrocaine bulbs and then goaded him into a heart attack which, except for his daughter, would have been fatal. Claire Pelton deserves the deepest gratitude of every Radical-Socialist in the state. She’s a smart girl, and she saved the life of her father and our leader.</p>
				<p>“But⁠—she is <em>not</em> a Literate!” he cried loudly. “All she did was something any of you could have done⁠—something I’ve done, myself, so that I won’t be locked out of my own safe and have to wait for a Literate to come and open, it for me. She simply kept her eye on the Literates who were opening the safe, and learned the combination from the positions to which they turned the dial. And you believe, on the strength of that, that she’s a Literate? The next thing, you’ll be believing that professional liar of a Slade Gardner. And you call yourselves politicians!” He fairly gargled obscenities.</p>
				<p>Looking around, he caught sight of a pair who seemed something less than impressed with his account of it. Joe West, thick-armed, hairy-chested, blue-jowled; Horace Yingling, thin and gangling. They weren’t Radical-Socialist party people; they were from the Political Action Committee of the Consolidated Illiterates Organization, and their slogan was simpler and more to the point than Chester Pelton’s⁠—the only good Literate is a dead Literate. He tensed himself and challenged them directly.</p>
				<p>“Joe; Horace. How about you? Satisfied the Pelton girl isn’t a Literate, now?”</p>
				<p>Yingling looked at West, and West looked back at him questioningly. Evidently the <i xml:lang="la">suavitor in modo</i> was Yingling’s province, and the <i xml:lang="la">fortior in re</i> was West’s.</p>
				<p>“Yeh, sure, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon,” Yingling said dubiously. “Now that you explain it, we see how it was.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>It was worse than that in some of the other boroughs. One fanatic, imagining that Cardon himself was a crypto-Literate, drew a gun. Cardon’s guards disarmed him and beat him senseless. At another headquarters, some character was circulating about declaring that not only Claire Pelton but her younger brother, Ray, as well, were Literates. Cardon’s two men hustled him out of the building, and, after about twenty minutes, returned alone. Cardon hoped that the body would not be found until after the polls closed, the next day.</p>
				<p>Finally, leaving his guards with the ’copter at a public landing stage, he made his way, by devious routes, to William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lancedale’s office, and found Lancedale at his desk, seeming not to have moved since he had showed his agent out earlier in the day.</p>
				<p>“Well, we’re in a nice puddle of something-or-other,” Cardon greeted him. “On top of that Gardner telecast, this morning⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Guthrie Parham’s taking care of that, and everything’s going to be done to ridicule Gardner,” Lancedale told him. “And even this business at the store can be turned to some advantage. Before we’re through, we may gain more votes than we lose for Pelton. And we had an informal meeting⁠—Joyner for Retail Merchandising, Starke for Grievance Settlements, and four or five others including myself, to make up a quorum. We had Bayne in, and heard his story of it, and we got a report from one of our stoolies in the store. Bayne thought he was due for a commendation; instead, he got an eat-out. Of course, it was a fact that Pelton’d hit him, and we can’t have Literates punched around, regardless of provocation. So we voted to fine Pelton ten million for beating Bayne up, and to award him ten million for losses resulting from unauthorized withdrawal of Literate services. We ordered a new crew of Literates to the store, and we exiled Bayne to Brooklyn, to something called Stillman’s Used Copter and Junk Bazaar. For the next few months, the only thing he’ll find that’s round and pinchable will be secondhand tires. But don’t be too hard on him; I think he did us a favor.”</p>
				<p>“You mean, starting a rift between Pelton and the Consolidated Illiterates’ Organization, which we can widen after the election?”</p>
				<p>“No. I hadn’t thought of it that way, Frank,” Lancedale smiled. “It’s an idea worth keeping in mind, and we’ll exploit it, later. What I was thinking about was the more immediate problem of the election⁠—”</p>
				<p>The buzzer on Lancedale’s desk interrupted, and a voice came out of the commo box:</p>
				<p>“Message, urgent and private, sir. Source named as Sforza.”</p>
				<p>Cardon recognized the name. Maybe the Independent-Conservatives have troubles, too, he thought hopefully. Then Lancedale’s video screen became the frame for an almost unbelievably commonplace set of features.</p>
				<p>“Sforza, sir,” the man in the screen said. “Sorry I’m late, but I was able to get out of the building only a few minutes ago, and I had to make sure I wasn’t wearing a tail. I have two new facts. First, the Conservatives have been bringing storm troops in from outside, from Philadelphia, and from Wilkes-Scranton, and from Buffalo. They are being concentrated in lower Manhattan, in plain clothes, with only concealed weapons, and carrying their hoods folded up under their coats. Second, I overheard a few snatches of conversation between two of the Conservative storm troop leaders, as follows: ‘… Start it in China⁠ ⁠… thirteen-thirty,’ and ‘… Important to make it appear either spontaneous or planned for business motives.’ ”</p>
				<p>“Try to get us more information, as quickly as possible,” Lancedale directed. “Obviously, we should know, by about thirteen hundred, what’s being planned.”</p>
				<p>“Right, sir.” Lancedale’s spy at Independent-Conservative headquarters nodded and vanished from the screen.</p>
				<p>“What does it sound like to you, Frank?” Lancedale asked.</p>
				<p>“China is obviously a code-designation for some place in downtown Manhattan, where the Conservative goon gangs are being concentrated. The only thing I can say is that it probably is not Chinatown. They’d either say ‘Chinatown’ and not ‘China,’ or they would use some code-designation that wasn’t so close to the actual name,” Cardon considered. “What they’re going to start, at thirteen-thirty, which is only two hours and a half from now, is probably some kind of a riot.”</p>
				<p>“A riot which could arise from business motives,” Lancedale added. “That sounds like the docks, or the wholesale district, or the garment district, or something like that.” He passed his hand rapidly over the photoelectric eye of the commo box. “Get me Major Slater,” he said; and, a little later, “Major, get a platoon out to Long Island, to Chester Pelton’s home; have the place searched for possible booby traps, and maintain guard there till further notice. You’ll have no trouble with the servants, they’re all in our pay. That platoon must not, repeat not, wear uniform or appear to have any connection with the Fraternities. Put another platoon in Pelton’s store. Concealed weapons, and plain clothes. They should carry their leather helmets in shopping bags, and roam about in the store, ostensibly shopping. And a full company, uniformed and armed with heavy weapons, alerted and ready for immediate ’copter movement.” He went on to explain about the intelligence report and the conclusions drawn from it. The guards officer repeated back his instructions, and Lancedale broke the connection.</p>
				<p>“Now, Frank,” he said, “I told you that this revelation of Claire Pelton’s Literacy can be turned to our advantage. There’s to be a full Council meeting at thirteen hundred. Here’s what I estimate Joyner and Graves will try to do, and here’s what I’m going to do to counter it⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>A couple of men in the maroon uniform of Pelton’s store police were waiting as Prestonby’s ’copter landed on the top stage; one of them touched his cap-visor with his gas-billy in salute and said: “Literate Prestonby? Miss Pelton is expecting you; she’s in her father’s office. This way, if you please, sir.”</p>
				<p>He had hoped to find her alone, but when he entered the office, he saw five or six of the store personnel with her. Since opening her father’s safe, she had evidently dropped all pretense of Illiteracy; there was a mass of papers spread on the big desk, and she was referring from one to another of them with the deft skill of a regular Fraternities Literate, while the others watched in fascinated horror.</p>
				<p>“Wait a moment, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hutschnecker,” she told the white-haired man in the blue and orange business suit with whom she had been talking, and laid the printed price-schedule down, advancing to meet him.</p>
				<p>“Ralph!” she greeted him. “Frank Cardon told me you were coming. I⁠—”</p>
				<p>For a moment, he thought of the afternoon, over two years ago, when she had entered his office at the school, and he had recognized her as the older sister of young Ray Pelton.</p>
				<p>“Professor Prestonby,” she had begun, accusingly, “you have been teaching my brother, Raymond Pelton, to read!”</p>
				<p>He had been prepared for that; had known that sooner or later there would be some minor leak in the security screen around the classrooms on the top floor.</p>
				<p>“My dear Miss Pelton,” he had protested pleasantly. “I think you’ve become overwrought over nothing. This pretense to Literacy is a phase most boys of Ray’s age pass through; they do it just as they play air-pirates or hijackers a few years earlier. The usual trick is to memorize something heard from a record disk, and then pretend to read it from print.”</p>
				<p>“Don’t try to kid me, professor. I know that Ray can read. I can prove it.”</p>
				<p>“And supposing he has learned a few words,” he had parried. “Can you be sure I taught him? And if so, what had you thought of doing about it? Are you going to expose me as a corrupter of youth?”</p>
				<p>“Not unless I have to,” she had replied coolly. “I’m going to blackmail you, professor. I want you to teach me to read, too.”</p>
				<p>Now, with this gang of her father’s Illiterate store officials present, a quick handclasp and a glance were all they could exchange.</p>
				<p>“How is he, Claire?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Out of danger, for the present. There was a medic here, who left just before you arrived. He brought nitrocaine bulbs, and gave father something to make him sleep. He’s lying down, back in his rest room.” She led him to a door at the rear of the office and motioned him to enter, following him. “He’s going to sleep for a couple of hours, yet.”</p>
				<p>The room was a sort of bedroom and dressing room, with a miniscule toilet and shower beyond. Pelton was lying on his back, sleeping; his face was pale, but he was breathing easily and regularly. Two of the store policemen, a sergeant and a patrolman, were playing cards on the little table, and the patrolman had a burp gun within reach.</p>
				<p>“All right, sergeant,” Claire said. “You and Gorman go out to the office. Call me if anything comes up that needs my attention, in the next few minutes.”</p>
				<p>The sergeant started to protest. Claire cut him off.</p>
				<p>“There’s no danger here. This Literate can be trusted; he’s a friend of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon’s. Works at the brewery. It’s all right.”</p>
				<p>The two rose and went out, leaving the door barely ajar. Prestonby and Claire, like a pair of marionettes on the same set of strings, cast a quick glance at the door and then were in each other’s arms. Chester Pelton slept placidly as they kissed and whispered endearments.</p>
				<p>It was Claire who terminated the embrace, looking apprehensively at her slumbering father.</p>
				<p>“Ralph, what’s it all about?” she asked. “I didn’t even know that you and Frank Cardon knew each other, let alone that he had any idea about us.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby thought furiously, trying to find a safe path through the tangle of Claire Pelton’s conflicting loyalties, trying to find a path between his own loyalties and his love for her, wondering how much it would be safe to tell her.</p>
				<p>“And Cardon’s gone completely cloak-and-dagger-happy,” she continued. “He’s talking about plots against my father’s life, and against me, and⁠—”</p>
				<p>“A lot of things are going on under cloaks, around here,” he told her. “And under Literate smocks, and under other kinds of costume. And a lot of daggers are out, too. You didn’t know Frank Cardon was a Literate, did you?”</p>
				<p>Her eyes widened. “I thought I was Literate enough to spot Literacy in anybody else,” she said. “No, I never even suspected⁠—”</p>
				<p>Somebody rapped on the door. “Miss Pelton,” the sergeant’s voice called. “Visiphone call from Literates’ Hall.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby smiled. “I’ll take it, if you don’t mind,” he said. “I’m acting-chief-Literate here, now, I suppose.”</p>
				<p>She followed him as he went out into Pelton’s office. When he snapped on the screen, a young man in a white smock, with the Fraternities Executive Section badge, looked out of it. He gave a slight start when he saw Prestonby.</p>
				<p>“Literate First Class Ralph <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">N.</abbr> Prestonby, acting voluntarily for Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise during emergency,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Literate First Class Armandez, Executive Section,” the man in the screen replied. “This call is in connection with the recent attack of Chester Pelton upon Literate First Class Bayne.”</p>
				<p>“Continue, understanding that we admit nothing,” Prestonby told him.</p>
				<p>“An extemporary session of the Council has found Pelton guilty of assaulting Literate Bayne, and has fined him ten million dollars,” Armandez announced.</p>
				<p>“We enter protest,” Prestonby replied automatically.</p>
				<p>“Wait a moment, Literate. The Council has also awarded Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise damages to the extent of ten million dollars, for losses incurred by suspension of Literate service, and voted censure against Literate Bayne for ordering said suspension without consent of the Council. Furthermore, a new crew of Literates, with their novices, guards, et cetera, is being sent at once to your store. Obviously, neither the Fraternities, nor Pelton’s, nor the public, would be benefitted by returning Literate Bayne or any of his crew; he has been given another assignment.”</p>
				<p>“Thank you. And when can we expect this new crew of Literates?” Prestonby asked.</p>
				<p>The man in the screen consulted his watch. “Probably inside of an hour. We’ve had to do some reshuffling; you know how these things are handled. And if you’ll pardon me, Literate; just what are you doing at Pelton’s? I understood that you were principal of Mineola High School.”</p>
				<p>“That’s a good question.” Prestonby hastily assessed the circumstances and their implications. “I’d suggest that you ask it of my superior, Literate Lancedale, however.”</p>
				<p>The Literate in the screen blinked; that was the equivalent, for him, of anybody else’s jaw dropping to his midriff.</p>
				<p>“Well! A pleasure, Literate. Good day.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“Miss Pelton!” The man in the blue-and-orange suit was still trying to catch her attention. “Where are we going to put that stuff? Russ Latterman’s out in the store, somewhere, and I can’t get in touch with him.”</p>
				<p>“What did you say it was?” she replied.</p>
				<p>“Fireworks, for the Peace Day trade. We want to get it on sale about the middle of the month.”</p>
				<p>“This was a fine time to deliver them. Peace Day isn’t till the Tenth of December. Put them down in the fireproof vault.”</p>
				<p>“That place is full of photographic film, and sporting ammunition, and other merchandise; stuff we’ll have to draw out to replace stock on the shelves during the sale,” the Illiterate objected.</p>
				<p>“The weather forecast for the next couple of days is fair,” Prestonby reminded her. “Why not just pile the stuff on the top stage, beyond the control tower, and put up warning signs?”</p>
				<p>The man⁠—Hutschnecker, Prestonby remembered hearing Claire call him⁠—nodded.</p>
				<p>“That might be all right. We could cover the cases with tarpaulins.”</p>
				<p>A buzzer drew one of the Illiterates to a handphone. He listened for a moment, and turned.</p>
				<p>“Hey, there’s a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Armytage Zydanowycz down in Furs; she wants to buy one of those mutated-mink coats, and she’s only got half a million bucks with her. How’s her credit?”</p>
				<p>Claire handed Prestonby a black-bound book. “Confidential credit-rating guide; look her up for us,” she said.</p>
				<p>Another buzzer rasped, before Prestonby could find the entry on Zydanowycz, <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Armytage; the Illiterate office worker, laying down one phone, grabbed up another.</p>
				<p>“They’re all outta small money in Notions; every son and his brother’s been in there in the last hour to buy a pair of dollar shoestrings with a grand-note.”</p>
				<p>“I’ll take care of that,” Hutschnecker said. “Wait till I call control tower, and tell them about the fireworks.”</p>
				<p>“How much does <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Armytage Zydanowycz want credit for?” Prestonby asked. “The book says her husband’s good for up to fifteen million, or fifty million in thirty days.”</p>
				<p>“Those coats are only five million,” Claire said. “Let her have it; be sure to get her thumbprint, though, and send it up here for comparison.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Claire; do you know how we’re going to handle this new Literate crew, when they get here?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, here’s the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">T.O.</abbr> for Literate service.” She tossed a big chart across the desk to him. “I made a few notes on it; you can give it to whoever is in charge.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>It went on, like that, for the next hour. When the new Literate crew arrived, Prestonby was delighted to find a friend, and a fellow-follower of Lancedale, in charge. Considering that Retail Merchandising was Wilton Joyner’s section, that was a good omen. Lancedale must have succeeded to an extraordinary degree in imposing his will on the Grand Council. Prestonby found, however, that he would need some time to brief the new chief Literate on the operational details at the store. He was unwilling to bring Claire too prominently into the conference, although he realized that it would be a matter of half an hour, at the outside, before every one of the new Literate crew would have heard about her Literate ability. If she’d only played dumb, after opening that safe⁠—</p>
				<p>Finally, by 1300, the new Literates had taken over, and the sale was running smoothly again. Latterman was somewhere out in the store, helping them; Claire had lunch for herself and Prestonby sent up from the restaurant, and for a while they ate in silence, broken by occasional spatters of small-talk. Then she returned to the question she had raised and he had not yet answered.</p>
				<p>“You say Frank Cardon’s a Literate?” she asked. “Then what’s he doing managing the Senator’s campaign? Fifth-columning?”</p>
				<p>He shook his head. “You think the Fraternities are a solid, monolithic, organization; everybody agreed on aims and means, and working together in harmony? That’s how it’s supposed to look, from the outside. On the inside, though, there’s a bitter struggle going on between two factions, over policy and for control. One faction wants to maintain the status quo⁠—a handful of Literates doing the reading and writing for an Illiterate public, and holding a monopoly on Literacy. They’re headed by two men, Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves. Bayne was one of that faction.”</p>
				<p>He paused, thinking quickly. If Lancedale had gotten the upper hand, there was likely to be a revision of the Joyner-Graves attitude toward Pelton. In that case, the less he said to incriminate Russell Latterman, the better. Let Bayne be the villain, for a while, he decided.</p>
				<p>“Bayne,” he continued, “is one of a small minority of fanatics who make a religion of Literacy. I believe he disposed of your father’s medicine, and then deliberately goaded him into a rage to bring on a heart attack. That doesn’t represent Joyner-Graves policy; it was just something he did on his own. He’s probably been disciplined for it, by now. But the Joyner-Graves faction are working for your father’s defeat and the reelection of Grant Hamilton.</p>
				<p>“The other faction is headed by a man you’ve probably never heard of, William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lancedale. I’m of his faction, and so is Frank Cardon. We want to see your father elected, because the socialization of Literacy would eventually put the Literates in complete control of the government. We also want to see Literacy become widespread, eventually universal, just as it was before World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>.”</p>
				<p>“But wouldn’t that mean the end of the Fraternities?” Claire asked.</p>
				<p>“That’s what Joyner and Graves say. We don’t believe so. And suppose it did? Lancedale says, if we’re so incompetent that we have to keep the rest of the world in ignorance to earn a living, the world’s better off without us. He says that every oligarchy carries in it the seeds of its own destruction; that if we can’t evolve with the rest of the world, we’re doomed in any case. That’s why we want to elect your father. If he can get his socialized Literacy program adopted, we’ll be in a position to load the public with so many controls and restrictions and formalities that even the most bigoted Illiterate will want to learn to read. Lancedale says, a private monopoly like ours is bad, but a government monopoly is intolerable, and the only way the public can get rid of it would be by becoming Literates, themselves.”</p>
				<p>She glanced toward the door of Pelton’s private rest room.</p>
				<p>“Poor Senator!” she said softly. “He hates Literacy so, and his own children are Literates, and his program against Literacy is being twisted against itself!”</p>
				<p>“But you agree that we’re right and he’s wrong?” Prestonby asked. “You must, or you’d never have come to me to learn to read.”</p>
				<p>“He’s such a good father. I’d hate to see him hurt,” she said. “But, Ralph, you’re my man. Anything you’re for, I’m for, and anything you’re against, I’m against.”</p>
				<p>He caught her hand, across the table, forgetful of the others in the office.</p>
				<p>“Claire, now that everybody knows⁠—” he began.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“<em>Top emergency! Top emergency!</em>” a voice brayed out of the alarm box on the wall. “<em>Serious disorder in Department Thirty-two! Serious disorder in Department Thirty-two!</em>”</p>
				<p>The voice broke off as suddenly as it had begun, but the box was not silent. From it came a medley of shouts, curses, feminine screams and splintering crashes. Prestonby and Claire were on their feet.</p>
				<p>“You have wall screens?” he asked. “How do they work? Like the ones at school?”</p>
				<p>Claire twisted a knob until the number 32 appeared on a dial, and pressed a button. On the screen, the Chinaware Department on the third floor came to life in full sound and color. The pickup must have been across an aisle from the box from whence the alarm had come; they could see one of Pelton’s Illiterate clerks lying unconscious under it, and the handphone dangling at the end of its cord. The aisles were full of jostling, screaming women, trampling one another and fighting frantically to get out, and, among them, groups of three or four men were gathered back to back. One such group had caught a store policeman; three were holding him while a fourth smashed vases over his head, grabbing them from a nearby counter. A pink dinner plate came skimming up from the crowd, narrowly missing the wired <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> pickup. A moment later, a blue-and-white sugar bowl, thrown with better aim, came curving at them in the screen. It scored a hit, and brought darkness, though the bedlam of sound continued.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">II</h3>
				<p>Cardon looked at his watch as he entered the Council Chamber at Literates’ Hall, smoothing his smock hastily under his Sam Browne. He’d made it with very little time to spare, before the doors would be sealed and the meeting would begin. He’d been all over town, tracking down that report of Sforza’s; he’d even made a quick visit to Chinatown, on the off chance that “China” had been used in an attempt at the double concealment of the obvious, but, as he’d expected, he’d found nothing. The people there hardly knew there was to be an election. Accustomed for millennia to ideographs read only by experts, they viewed the current uproar about Literacy with unconcern.</p>
				<p>At the door, he deposited his pocket recorder⁠—no sound-recording device was permitted, except the big audiovisual camera in front, which made the single permanent record. Going around the room counterclockwise to the seats of his faction, he encountered two other Lancedale men: Gerald <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">K.</abbr> Toppington, of the Technological Section, thin-faced, sandy-haired, balding; and Franklin <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Chernov, commander of the local Literates’ guards brigade, with his ragged gray mustache, his horribly scarred face, and his outsize tablet-holster almost as big as a mail-order catalogue.</p>
				<p>“What’s Joyner-Graves trying to do to us, Frank?” Chernov rumbled gutturally.</p>
				<p>“It’s what we’re going to do to them,” Cardon replied. “Didn’t the chief tell you?”</p>
				<p>Chernov shook his head. “No time. I only got here fifteen minutes ago. Chasing all over town about that tip from Sforza. Nothing, of course. Nothing from Sforza, either. The thing must have been planned weeks ago, whatever it is, and everybody briefed personally, and nothing on disk or tape about it. But what’s going to happen here? Lancedale going to pull a rabbit out of his hat?”</p>
				<p>Cardon explained. Chernov whistled. “Man, that’s no rabbit; that’s a full-grown Bengal tiger! I hope it doesn’t eat us, by mistake.”</p>
				<p>Cardon looked around, saw Lancedale in animated argument with a group of his associates. Some of the others seemed to be sharing Chernov’s fears.</p>
				<p>“I have every confidence in the chief,” Toppington said. “If his tigers make a meal off anybody, it’ll be⁠—” He nodded in the direction of the other side of the chamber, where Wilton Joyner, short, bald, pompous, and Harvey Graves, tall and cadaverous, stood in a Rosencrantz-Guildenstern attitude, surrounded by half a dozen of their top associates.</p>
				<p>The Council President, Morehead, came out a little door onto the rostrum and took his seat, pressing a button. The call bell began clanging slowly. Lancedale, glancing around, saw Cardon and nodded. On both sides of the chamber, the Literates began taking seats, and finally the call bell stopped, and Literate President Morehead rapped with his gavel. The opening formalities were hustled through. The routine held-over business was rubber-stamped with hasty votes of approval, even including the decisions of the extemporary meeting of that morning on the affair at Pelton’s. Finally, the presiding officer rapped again and announced that the meeting was now open for new business.</p>
				<p>At once, Harvey Graves was on his feet.</p>
				<p>“Literate President,” he began, as soon as the chair had recognized him, “this is scarcely <em>new</em> business, since it concerns a problem, a most serious problem, which I and some of my colleagues have brought to the attention of this Council many times in the past⁠—the problem of Black Literacy!” He spat out the two words as though they were a mouthful of poison. “Literate President and fellow Literates, if anything could destroy our Fraternities, to which we have given our lives’ devotion, it would be the widespread tendency to bypass the Fraternities, the practice of Literacy by non-Fraternities people⁠—”</p>
				<p>“We’ve heard all that before, Wilton!” somebody from the Lancedale side called out. “What do you want to talk about that you haven’t gotten on every record of every meeting for the last thirty years?”</p>
				<p>“Why, this Pelton business,” Graves snapped back at him. “You know what I mean. Your own associates are responsible for it!” He turned back to face the chair, and, with a surprising minimum of invective, described the scene in which Claire Pelton had demonstrated her Literacy. “And that’s not all, brother Literates,” he continued. “Since then, I’ve been receiving reports from the Pelton store. Claire Pelton has been openly doing the work of a Literate; going over the store’s written records, checking inventories, checking the credit guide, handling the price lists⁠—”</p>
				<p>“What’s that got to do with Black Literacy?” Gerald Toppington demanded. “Black Literacy is a term which labels the professional practice of Literacy, for hire, by a non-Fraternity Literate, or Literate service furnished for criminal or politically subversive purposes, or the betrayal of a client by a Fraternity Literate. There’s nothing of the sort involved here. This girl, who does appear to be Literate, is simply looking after the interests of her family’s business.”</p>
				<p>“She was taught by a Literate, a Fraternities-member, under, to say the very least, irregular circumstances, and without payment of any fee. Any fee, that is, that the Fraternities can collect any percentage on. And the Literate who taught her also taught her younger brother, Ray Pelton, and this Literate, who is known to be her lover⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Suppose he is her lover, so what?” one of Lancedale’s partisans demanded. “You say, yourself, that she’s a Literate. That ought to remove any objection. Why, if she were to come forward and admit and demonstrate her Literacy, there’d be no possible objection from the Fraternities’ viewpoint to her marrying young Prestonby.”</p>
				<p>“And as for Prestonby’s action in teaching Literacy to her and to her brother,” Cardon spoke up, “I think he deserves the thanks and commendation of the Fraternities. He’s put a period to four generations of bigoted Illiterates.”</p>
				<p>Wilton Joyner was on his feet. “Will Literate Graves yield for a motion?” he asked. “Thank you, Harvey. Literate President, and brother Literates: I yield to no man in my abhorrence of Black Literacy, or in my detestation for the political principles of which Chester Pelton has made himself the spokesman, but I deny that we should allow the acts and opinions of the Illiterate parent to sway us in our consideration of the Literate children. It has come to my notice, as it has to Literate Graves,’ that this young woman, Claire Pelton, is Literate to a degree that would be a credit to any Literate First Class, and her brother can match his Literacy creditably against that of any novice in our Fraternities. To show that we respect Literate ability, wherever we find it; to show that we are not the monopolistic closed-corporation our enemies accuse us of being; to show that we are not animated by a vindictive hatred of anything bearing the name of Pelton⁠—I move, and ask that my motion be presented for seconding, that Claire Pelton, and her brother, Raymond Pelton, be duly elected, respectively, to the positions of Literate Third Class and Literate Novice, as members of the Associated Fraternities of Literates!”</p>
				<p>From the Joyner-Graves side, there were dutiful cries of, “Yes! Yes! Admit the young Peltons!” and also gasps of horrified surprise from the rank-and-filers who hadn’t been briefed on what was coming up.</p>
				<p>Lancedale was on his feet in an instant. “Literate President!” he cried. “In view of the delicate political situation, and in view of Chester Pelton’s violent denunciation of our Fraternities⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Literate Lancedale,” the President objected. “The motion is not to be debated until it has been properly seconded.”</p>
				<p>“What does the Literate President think I’m doing?” Lancedale retorted. “I second the motion!”</p>
				<p>Joyner looked at Lancedale in angry surprise, which gradually became fearful suspicion. His stooge, who had already risen with a prepared speech of seconding, simply gaped.</p>
				<p>“Furthermore,” Lancedale continued, “I move an amendment to Literate Joyner’s motion. I move that the ceremony of the administration of the Literates’ Oath, and the investiture in the smock and insignia, be carried out as soon as possible, and that an audiovisual recording be made, and telecast this evening, before twenty-one hundred.”</p>
				<p>Brigade commander Chernov, prodded by Cardon, jumped to his feet.</p>
				<p>“Excellent!” he cried. “I second the motion to amend the motion of Literate Joyner.”</p>
				<p>If there were such a thing as a bomb which would explode stunned silence, Lancedale and Chernov had dropped such a bomb. Cardon could guess how Joyner and Graves felt; they were now beginning to be afraid of their own proposition. As for the Lancedale Literates, he knew how many of them felt. He’d felt the same way, himself, when Lancedale had proposed the idea. He got to his feet.</p>
				<p>“Literate President, brother Literates,” he raised his voice. “I call for an immediate vote on this amended motion, which I, personally, endorse most heartily, and which I hope to see carried unanimously.”</p>
				<p>“Now, wait a minute!” Joyner objected. “This motion ought to be debated⁠—”</p>
				<p>“What do you want to debate about it?” Chernov demanded. “You presented it, didn’t you?”</p>
				<p>“Well, I wanted to give the Council an opportunity to discuss it, as typical of our problems in dealing with Black.⁠ ⁠… I mean, non-Fraternities.⁠ ⁠… Literacy⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You mean, you didn’t know it was loaded!” Cardon told him. “Well, that’s your hard luck; we’re going to squeeze the trigger!”</p>
				<p>“I withdraw the motion!” Joyner shouted.</p>
				<p>“Literate President,” Lancedale said gently, his thin face lighting with an almost saintly smile, “Literate Joyner simply cannot withdraw his motion, now. It has been properly seconded and placed before the house, and so has my own humble contribution to it. I demand that the motion be acted upon.”</p>
				<p>“Vote! Vote! Vote!” the Lancedale Literates began yelling.</p>
				<p>“I call on all my adherents to vote against this motion!” Joyner shouted.</p>
				<p>“Now look here, Wilton!” Harvey Graves shouted, reddening with anger. “You’re just making a fool out of me. This was your idea, in the first place! Do you want to smash everything we’ve ever done in the Fraternities?”</p>
				<p>“Harvey, we can’t go on with it,” Joyner replied. He crossed quickly to Graves’ seat and whispered something.</p>
				<p>“For the record,” Lancedale said sweetly, “our colleague, Literate Joyner, has just whispered to Literate Graves that since I have seconded his motion, he’s now afraid of it. I think Literate Graves is trying to assure him that my support is merely a bluff. For the information of this body, I want to state categorically that it is not, and that I will be deeply disappointed if this motion does not pass.”</p>
				<p>An elderly Literate on the Joyner-Graves side, an undersized man with a bald head and a narrow mouth, was on his feet. He looked like an aged rat brought to bay by a terrier.</p>
				<p>“I was against this fool idea from the start!” he yelled. “We’ve got to keep the Illiterates down; how are we ever going to do that if we go making Literates out of them? But you two thought you were being smart⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Shut up and sit down, you old jackass!” one of Joyner’s people shouted at him.</p>
				<p>“Shut up, yourself, Ginter,” a hatchet-faced woman Literate from the Finance Section squawked.</p>
				<p>Literate President Morehead, an amiable and ineffective maiden aunt in trousers, pounded frantically with his gavel. “Order!” he fairly screamed. “This is disgraceful!”</p>
				<p>“You can say that again!” Brigade commander Chernov boomed. “What do you people over on the right think this is; an Illiterates’ Organization Political Action meeting?”</p>
				<p>“Vote! Vote!” Cardon bellowed.</p>
				<p>Literate President Morehead banged his gavel and, in a last effort, started the call bell clanging.</p>
				<p>“The motion has been presented and seconded; the amendment has been presented and seconded. It will now be put to a vote!”</p>
				<p>“Roll call!” Cardon demanded. Four or five other voices, from both sides of the chamber, supported him.</p>
				<p>“The vote will be by roll call,” Literate President Morehead agreed. “Addison, Walter <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr>”</p>
				<p>“Aye!” He was a subordinate of Harvey Graves.</p>
				<p>“Agostino, Pedro <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:given-name">V.</abbr>”</p>
				<p>“Aye!” He was a Lancedale man.</p>
				<p>So it went on. Graves voted for the motion. Joyner voted against it. All the Lancedale faction, now convinced that their leader had the opposition on the run, voted loudly for it.</p>
				<p>“The vote has been one hundred and eighty-three for, seventy-two against,” Literate President Morehead finally announced. “The motion is herewith declared carried. Literate Lancedale, I appoint you to organize a committee to implement the said motion, at once.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Prestonby flung open the door of the rest room where Sergeant Coccozello and his subordinate were guarding the unconscious Pelton.</p>
				<p>“Sergeant! Who’s in charge of store police, now?”</p>
				<p>Coccozello looked blank for an instant. “I guess I am,” he said. “Lieutenant Dunbar’s off on his vacation, in Mexico, and Captain Freizer’s in the hospital; he was taken sick suddenly last evening.”</p>
				<p>Probably poisoned, Prestonby thought, making a mental note to find out which hospital and get in touch with one of the Literate medics there.</p>
				<p>“Well, come out here, sergeant, and have a look around the store on the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>. We have troubles.”</p>
				<p>Coccozello could hear the noise that was still coming out of the darkened screen. As he stepped forward, Claire got another pickup, some distance from the one that had been knocked out. A mob of women customers were surging away from the Chinaware Department, into Glassware; they were running into the shopping crowd there, with considerable disturbance. A couple of store police were trying to get through the packed mass of humanity, and making slow going of it. Coccozello swore and started calling on his reserves on one of the handphones.</p>
				<p>“Wait a moment, sergeant,” Prestonby stopped him. “Don’t commit any of your reserves down there. We’re going to need them to hold the executive country, up here. This is only the start of a general riot.”</p>
				<p>“Who are you and what do you know about it?” Coccozello challenged.</p>
				<p>“Listen to him, Guido,” Claire said. “He knows what he’s doing.”</p>
				<p>“Claire, you have some way of keeping a running count of the number of customers in and out of the store, haven’t you?” Prestonby asked.</p>
				<p>“Why, yes; here.” She pointed to an indicator on Chester Pelton’s desk, where constantly changing numbers danced.</p>
				<p>“And don’t you have a continuous check on sales, too? How do they jibe?”</p>
				<p>“They don’t; look. Sales are away below any expectation from the number of customers, even allowing for shopping habits of a bargain-day crowd. But what’s that got to do⁠—”</p>
				<p>Prestonby was back at the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>, shifting from pickup to pickup.</p>
				<p>“Look, sergeant, Claire. That isn’t a normal bargain-day crowd, is it? Look at those groups of men, three or four to a group, shifting around, waiting for something to happen. This store’s been infiltrated by a big goon gang. That business in Chinaware’s just the start, to draw our reserves down to the third floor. Look at that, now.”</p>
				<p>He had a pickup on the twelfth floor, the floor just under the public landing stages, and at the foot of the escalators leading to the central executive block.</p>
				<p>“See how they’re concentrating, there?” he pointed out. “In that ladies’ wear department, there are three men for every woman, and the men are all drifting from counter to counter over in the direction of our escalators.”</p>
				<p>Coccozello swore again, feelingly. “Literate, you know your stuff!” he said. “That fuss in China is just a feint; this is where they’re really going to hit. What do you think it is? Macy &amp; Gimbel’s trying to bust up our sale, or politics?”</p>
				<p>Prestonby shrugged. “Take your choice. A competitor would concentrate where your biggest volume of sale was going on, though; political enemies would try to get up here, and that’s what this gang’s trying to do.”</p>
				<p>“He’s absolutely right, Guido,” Claire told the sergeant. “Do whatever he tells you.”</p>
				<p>Sergeant Coccozello looked at him, awaiting orders.</p>
				<p>“We can’t commit our reserves in that Chinaware Department fight; we need them up here. Where are they, now, and how many?”</p>
				<p>“Thirteen, counting myself and the man in there.” He nodded toward the room where Chester Pelton lay in drugged sleep. “In the squad room, on the floor below.”</p>
				<p>“And for the mob below to get up here?”</p>
				<p>“Two escalators, sir, northeast and southwest corners of office country. And we got some new counters that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Latterman had built, that didn’t get put out in time for the sale. We can use them to build barricades, if we have to.”</p>
				<p>“How about a ’copter attack on the roof?”</p>
				<p>Coccozello grinned. “I’d like to see that, now, Literate. We got plenty of A-A equipment up there⁠—four 7-<abbr>mm</abbr> machine guns, two 12-<abbr>mm</abbr>’s, and one 20-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-cannon. We could hold off the State Guard with that.”</p>
				<p>“That isn’t saying much, but they’re not even that good. So it’ll be the escalators. Think, now, sergeant. Fires, burglary, holdups⁠—”</p>
				<p>The sergeant’s grin widened. “High-pressure fire hose, one at the head of each escalator, and a couple more that can be dragged over from other outlets. Say we put two men on each hose, lying down at the head of the escalators. And we got plenty of firearms; we can arm some of these clerks, up here⁠—”</p>
				<p>“All right; do that. And put out an emergency call, by inter-department telephone, not by public address, to floorwalkers from the fifth floor down, to gather up all male clerks and other store personnel in their departments, arm them with anything they can find, and rush them to Chinaware. Tell them to shout ‘Pelton!’ when they hit the mob, to avoid breaking each others’ heads in the confusion, and tell them they’re expected to hold the Chinaware and Glassware departments themselves, without any help from the store police.”</p>
				<p>“Why not?” Claire wanted to know.</p>
				<p>“That’s how battles come to happen at the wrong time and place,” Prestonby told her. “Two small detachments collide, and each sends back for reinforcements, and the next thing anybody knows, there’s a full-size battle going on where nobody wants to fight one. We’re going to fight our main battle at the head of the escalators from the twelfth floor.”</p>
				<p>“You’ve done this sort of work before, Literate,” Coccozello grinned. “You talk like a storm-troop captain. What else?”</p>
				<p>“Well, so far, we’ve just been talking defense. We need to take the offensive, ourselves.” He glanced around. “Is there a freight elevator from this block to the basement?”</p>
				<p>“Yeah. Wait till I see.” Coccozello went to the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>-screen and dialed. “Yeah, and the elevator’s up here, too,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Well, you take what men you can spare⁠—a couple of your cops, and a couple of the office crew⁠—arm them with pistols, carbines, clubs, whatever you please, and take them down to the basement. Gather up all the warehouse gang, down there, and arm them. And as soon as you get to the basement, send the elevator back up here. That’s our life line; we can’t risk having it captured. You’ll organize flying squads to go up into the store from the basement. Bust up any trouble that seems to be getting started, if you can, but your main mission will be to rescue store police, Literates, Literates’ guards, and store help, and get them back to the basement. They’ll be picked up from there and brought up here on the elevator.” He picked up a pad from a desk and wrote a few lines on it. “Show this to any Literate you meet; get Literate Hopkinson to countersign it for you, when you find him. Tell him we want his whole gang up here as soon as possible.”</p>
				<p>“How about getting help from outside?” Claire asked. “The city police, or⁠—”</p>
				<p>“City police won’t lift a finger,” Prestonby told her. “They never help anybody who has a private police force; they have too much to do protecting John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">Q.</abbr> Citizen. Hutschnecker; suppose you call Radical-Socialist campaign headquarters; tell them to rush some of their Lone Rangers around here⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Russell <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Latterman was lunching in the store restaurant, at a table next the thick glass partition, where he could look out across Confectionery and Pastries toward the Tobacco Shoppe and the Liquor Department. There were two ways of looking at it, of course. He was occupying a table that might have been used by a customer, but, on the other hand, he was known by sight to many of the customers, and the fact that he was eating here had some advertising value, and he could keep his eye on the business going on around him. Off in the distance, he caught the white flash of a Literate smock at one of the counters; one of the new crew sent in to replace the ones Bayne had pulled out. He was glad and at the same time disturbed. He had had his doubts about staging a Literates’ strike, and he was almost positive that Wilton Joyner had known nothing about it. The whole thing had been Harvey Graves’ idea. There was a serious question of Literate ethics involved, to say nothing of the effect on the public. The trick of forcing Claire Pelton to reveal her secret Literacy was all right, although he wished that it had been Frank Cardon who had opened that safe. Or did he? Cardon would have brazened it out, claimed to have memorized the combination after having learned it by observation, and would probably have gotten away with it. But that silly girl had lost her head afterward, and had gone on to brand herself, irrevocably, as a Literate.</p>
				<p>One of the waitresses was hurrying toward him, almost falling over herself in excitement. She began talking when she was ten feet from the table.</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Latterman! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Latterman!” she was calling to him. “A terrible fight, down in Chinaware⁠—!”</p>
				<p>“Well, what do we have store police for?” he demanded. “They can take care of it. Now be quiet, Madge; don’t get the customers excited!”</p>
				<p>He returned to his lunch, watching, with satisfaction, the crowd that was packing into the Liquor Department, next to the restaurant. That special loss-leader, Old Atom-Bomb Rye, had been a good idea. In the first place, the stuff was fit for nothing but cleaning drains and removing varnish; if he were Pelton, he would have fired that fool buyer who got them overstocked on it. But the audio-advertiser, outside, was reiterating: “<em>Choice whiskies, two hundred dollars a sixth and up!</em>” and pulling in the customers, who, when they discovered that the two-hundred-dollar bargain was Old Atom-Bomb, were shelling out five hundred to a grand a sixth for good liquor.</p>
				<p>He finished his coffee and got to his feet. Be a good idea to look in on Liquor, and see how things were going. The department was getting more and more crowded every minute; three customers were entering for every one who left.</p>
				<p>On the way, he passed two women, and caught a snatch of conversation:</p>
				<p>“Don’t go down on the third floor, for Heaven’s sake⁠ ⁠… terrible fight⁠ ⁠… smashing everything up⁠—”</p>
				<p>Worried, he continued into Liquor, and the looks of the crowd there increased his worries. Too many men between twenty and thirty, all dressed alike, looking alike, talking and acting alike. It looked like a goon-gang infiltration, and he was beginning to see why Harvey Graves had wanted the Literates pulled out, and why Joyner, bound by ethics to do nothing against the commercial interests of Pelton’s, had known nothing about it. He started toward a counter, to speak to a clerk, but one of the stocky, quietly-dressed young men stepped in front of him.</p>
				<p>“Gimme a bottle of Atom-Bomb,” he said. “Don’t bother wrapping it.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, sir.” The clerk seemed worried, too. He got the bottle and set it on the counter. “That’ll be two C, sir.”</p>
				<p>“I see you’re wearing a Radical-Socialist button,” the customer commented. “Because you want to, or because Chet Pelton makes you?”</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton never interferes with his employees’ political convictions,” the clerk replied loyally.</p>
				<p>Saying nothing, the customer took the bottle, swung it by the neck, and smashed it over the clerk’s head, knocking him senseless.</p>
				<p>“That’s all that rotgut’s good for,” the customer said, jumping over the counter. “All right, boys; help yourselves!”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>For a surprisingly long time, the riot was localized in China, where it had begun. Using, alternately, three <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>-pickups around the scene of the disturbance, Prestonby watched its progress, and watched successive details of store personnel, armed with clubs and a few knives and sono pistols, hit the riot, shouting their battle cry, and vanish. They were, of course, lambs of sacrifice, however unlamblike their conduct. They were buying time, and they were drawing groups of goons into the action in China and Glassware who might have been making trouble elsewhere.</p>
				<p>There was an outbreak on the sixth floor, in Liquor; Claire, touring the store on the other <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>-screen, spotted it and called his attention to it. Back of the shattered glass partition, a mob of men were snatching bottles from the shelves and tossing them out to the crowd. One of the clerks, in his gray uniform jacket, was lying unconscious outside. While Prestonby watched, another, and another, came flying out the doorway. A fourth victim, in ordinary business clothes, tattered and disheveled, came flying out after them, to land in a heap, stunned for an instant, and then pick himself up. Prestonby laughed heartily when he recognized Literate⁠—undercover⁠—First Class Russell <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Latterman.</p>
				<p>“I ought to have anticipated that,” he said. “Any time there’s a riot, the liquor stores are the first things looted. The liquor stores, and the⁠—Claire! See what’s going on in Sporting Goods!”</p>
				<p>Sporting Goods, between Tools &amp; Hardware and Toys, on the fifth floor, was swamped. One of the clerks was lying on the floor in a puddle of blood, past any help; none of the others were in sight. The gun racks and pistol cases were being cleaned out systematically. This had been organized in advance. There were four or five men working industriously wiping grease out of bores and actions before handing out firearms, and a couple more making sure that the right cartridges went with each weapon. Somebody had brought a small grinding wheel over from Tools and plugged it in, and was grinding points on the foils and épées. Others were collecting baseball bats, golf clubs, and football helmets and catchers’ masks. The Tool Department was being stripped of everything that could be used as a weapon, too.</p>
				<p>The whole store, by this time, was an approximation of Mutiny in a Madhouse. Dressgoods was being looted by a howling mob of women, who were pulling bolts of material from shelves and fighting among themselves over them. Somebody had turned on the electric fans, and long streams of flimsy fabric were blowing about like a surrealist maypole dance. Somebody in Household Furnishings had turned on a couple of fans, too, and a mob of hoodlums were opening cans of paint and throwing them into the fan blades.</p>
				<p>The little Antiques Department, in a corner of the fourth floor back of the Gift Shoppe, was an island of peace in the general chaos. There was only one way into it, and one of the clerks, who had gotten himself into a suit of Fifteenth Century battle armor, was standing in the entrance, leaning on a two-hand sword. There was blood on the long blade, and more blood splashed on the floor in front of him. He was being left entirely alone.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Hutschnecker, called to the telephone, spoke briefly, listened for a while, spoke again in hearty thanks, and hung up.</p>
				<p>“Macy &amp; Gimbel’s,” he told Prestonby. “They heard about our trouble⁠—probably one of their price-spotters phoned in about it⁠—and they’re offering to send twenty of their store-cops to help us out. They’ll be landing on our stage in eight minutes, rifles and steel helmets.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby nodded. It would have been quite conceivable that Pelton’s chief competitor had started the riot; since they hadn’t, their offer of armed aid was just as characteristic of the bitter but mutually-respectful rivalries of the commercial world. A few minutes later, another call came in, this time on the visiphone. Prestonby took it when he saw a Literates’ Guards officer in the screen and recognized him.</p>
				<p>“That you, Prestonby?” the officer, Major Slater, asked in some surprise. “Didn’t know you were at Pelton’s. What’s going on, there?”</p>
				<p>Prestonby told him, briefly.</p>
				<p>“Yes; we had some of our people at the store, in plain clothes,” Slater said. “Just in case of trouble. On <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">L.</abbr>’s orders. They reported a riot starting, but naturally, their reports were incomplete. Can you get one of your landing stages cleared for us? We have two hundred men, in twenty ’copters.” Then he must have noticed some of the store Illiterates back of Prestonby, and realized that this offer of help to Literacy’s worst enemy would arouse suspicion. “Not that we care what happens to Chester Pelton, but we have to protect our own people at the store.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, of course,” Prestonby agreed. “Come in on our north stage. You’ll probably find a fight going on on our twelfth floor, just inside. Anybody who’s trying to get up the escalators to the office block will be an enemy.”</p>
				<p>“Right. We’re halfway there now.” The Literates’ Guards officer broke the connection.</p>
				<p>“You heard that?” he asked, turning to the others in the office. “If we can hold out till they get here, we’re all right. Did you contact Radical-Socialist headquarters, yet, Hutschnecker?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. I talked to a fellow named Yingling. He said that all the party storm troops had been lured out to some kind of a disturbance in North Jersey Borough; he’d try to get them recalled.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby swore bitterly. “By the time his own party-goons get here, the Literates’ Guards and Macy &amp; Gimbel’s will have pulled Pelton’s bacon off the fire for him. Nice friends he has!”</p>
				<p>An alarm buzzer went off suddenly, and an urgent voice came out of the box on the wall:</p>
				<p>“Here come the goons! South escalator!”</p>
				<p>Prestonby grabbed a burp gun and a canvas musette bag full of clips. By the time he had gotten down to what, in deference to the superstitions of the Illiterate store force, was known as the fourteenth floor, an attack on the north escalator had developed as well. In both cases, the attackers seemed to expect no organized resistance. They simply jumped onto the escalators, adding their own running speed, and came rushing up, firing pistols ahead of them at random.</p>
				<p>The defenders, however, had been ready: the fire hoses caught those in the lead and hurled them back. Some of them vaulted the barrier between the ascending and descending spirals and let themselves be carried down again. Less than five minutes after the buzzer had sounded the warning, the attack stopped. The noise on the twelfth floor increased, however, and, leaning over into the escalator-way, Prestonby could see the rioters firing in the direction of the entrance from the north landing stage. Within a matter of thirty seconds, they began to flee, and a wave of Literates’ Guards, in their futuristic “space cadet” uniforms, came pouring in after them.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Douglass MacArthur Yetsko put the burp gun back together again, tried the action, and laid it aside with a sigh. He had cleaned every weapon in his and Prestonby’s private arsenal, since lunch, and now he had to admit the unpalatable fact that there was nothing left to do but turn on the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>. Ray had been no company at all; the boy hadn’t spoken a word since he’d started rummaging among the captain’s books. Gloomily, he snapped on the screen to sample the soap shows.</p>
				<p>Della Pallas was in jail again, this time accused of murdering the lawyer who had gotten her acquitted on a previous murder rap. Considering the fact that she had languished in jail for almost a year during the other trial, Yetsko felt that she had a sound motive. Rudolf Barstow, in “Broadway Wife,” was, like Bruce’s spider, spinning his five hundredth web to ensnare the glamorous Marie Knobble. And there was a show about a schoolteacher and her class of angelic little tots that almost brought Yetsko’s lunch up.</p>
				<p>He shifted the dial again; a young Literate announcer was speaking quickly, excitedly:</p>
				<p>“… Scene of the riot, already the worst this year, and growing steadily worse. We take you now to downtown Manhattan, where our portable units and commentators have just arrived, and switch you to Ed Morgan.”</p>
				<p>The screen went black, and Yetsko swore angrily. Ray lifted his head quickly from his book and reached for the sono pistol Yetsko had given him.</p>
				<p>“Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen, and just a moment, until we can give you the picture. We’re having what is usually labeled as ‘slight technical difficulties,’ in this case the difficulty of avoiding having a hole shot in our camera or in your commentator’s head. Yes, that’s shooting you hear; there, somebody’s using an auto rifle! How are you coming, Steve?”</p>
				<p>A voice muttered something which, two centuries ago, would have caused an earthshaking scandal in the whole radio-<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> industry.</p>
				<p>“Well, till Steve gets things fixed up, a brief review, to date, of what’s sure to go down in history as the Battle of Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Huh?” Ray fairly shouted, the book forgotten.</p>
				<p>“… Started in the Chinaware Department, as a relatively innocent brawl, and spread to the Liquor Department, and then, all of a sudden, everybody started playing rough. At first, it was suspected that Macy &amp; Gimbel’s had sent a goon gang around to break up Pelton’s fall sale, but when the former concern rallied to the assistance of their competitor with a force of twenty riflemen, that began to look less likely, and we’re beginning to think that it might be the work of some of Pelton’s political enemies. About ten minutes ago, Major James <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.</abbr> Slater, of the Literates’ Guards, arrived with two hundred of his men, to protect the Literates on duty at the store. They captured the entire twelfth floor, where we are, now, with the exception of the Ladies’ Lingerie and Hosiery departments around one of the escalators to the lower floors; here the gang who started the riot, and who are now donning white hoods to distinguish themselves from the various other factions involved, have thrown up barricades of counters and display tables and are fighting bitterly to keep control of the escalator head. Ah, here we are!”</p>
				<p>The screen lit suddenly, and they were looking, Ray over Yetsko’s shoulder, across the devastated expanse of what had been the Ladies’ Frocks department, toward Lingerie and Hosiery, which seemed to have been thoroughly looted, then stripped of everything that could be used to build a barricade.</p>
				<p>“… Seems to have been quite a number of heavy ’copters just landed on the east stage, filled with more goons, probably to reinforce the gang back of that barricade. The firing’s gotten noticeably heavier⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Yetsko had turned from the screen, and was pawing in the arms locker. For a job like this, he’d need firepower. He took the ten-shot clip from the butt of his pistol and inserted one with a curling hundred-shot drum at the bottom, and shoved two more like it into the pockets of his jacket. And now, something to clear the way with. He took out a three-foot length of weighted fire hose.</p>
				<p>Then he saw Ray. That kid was pinning him down, here, while the captain was probably fighting for his life! But the captain’d told him to stay with Ray⁠—He dropped the weighted hose.</p>
				<p>“What’s the matter, Doug?” the boy asked. “Pick it up and let’s get going.”</p>
				<p>He shook his head. “Can’t. The captain told me I had to take care of you.”</p>
				<p>The boy opened his mouth to speak, closed it again, and thought for a moment. Then he asked:</p>
				<p>“Doug, didn’t Captain Prestonby tell you to stay with me?”</p>
				<p>“Yes⁠—”</p>
				<p>“All right. You do just that, because I’m going to help Claire and the senator. That’s who that goon gang’s after.”</p>
				<p>Yetsko considered the proposition for a moment, horrified. Why, this was the captain’s girl’s kid brother; if anything happened to him⁠—His mind refused to contemplate what the captain would do to him.</p>
				<p>“No. You gotta stay here, Ray,” he said. “The captain⁠—”</p>
				<p>Then his eye caught the screen. Ed Morgan must have found a place where he could run his camera up on an extension rod from behind something; they were looking down, from almost ceiling height, at the barricade, and at the Literates’ guards who were firing from cover at it. A sudden blast of automatic-weapons burst from the barricade; more men in white hoods came boiling up the escalator, and they all rushed forward. The few Literates’ guards skirmishers were overwhelmed. He saw one of them, a man he knew, Sam Igoe, from Company 5, go down wounded; he saw one of the white-hooded goons pause to brain him with a carbine butt before charging on.</p>
				<p>“Why, you dirty rotten Illiterate⁠—!” he roared, retrieving his weighted hose. “Come on, Ray; let’s go!”</p>
				<p>Ray hesitated, as though in thought. “Ken Dorchin; Harry Cobb; Dick Hirschfield; Jerry McCarty; Ramón Nogales; Pete Shawne; Tom Hutchinson⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Who⁠—?” Yetsko began. “What’ve they gotta do with⁠—?”</p>
				<p>“We need a gang; the two of us’d last about as long as a pint of beer at a Dutch picnic.” Ray went to the desk, grabbed a pen, and made a list of names, in a fair imitation of Ralph Prestonby’s neat block-printing. “Give this to the girl outside, and tell her to have them called for and sent in here,” the boy directed. “And see if you can find us some transport. I think there ought to be a couple of big ’copters finished down at the shops. And if you can find a couple more Literates’ guards you can talk into going with us⁠—”</p>
				<p>Yetsko nodded and took the paper without question. He was not, and he would be the first to admit it, of the thinking type. He was a good sergeant, but he had to have an officer to tell him what to do. Ray Pelton might be only fifteen years old, but his sister was the captain’s girl, and that put him in the officer class. A very young and recently-commissioned second lieutenant, say, but definitely an officer. Yetsko took the list and looked at it. Like most Literates’ guards, he could read, after a fashion. He recognized the names; the boys were all members of the top floor secret society. He went out and gave the list to Martha Collins.</p>
				<p>He’d expected some argument with her, but she seemed to accept Ray Pelton’s printing as Prestonby’s; she began checking room charts and class lists, and calling for the boys to be sent at once to the office. He went out, and down to the ’copter repair shop, where he found that a big four-ton air truck that the senior class had been working on for several weeks was finished.</p>
				<p>“That thing been tested, yet?” he asked the instructor.</p>
				<p>“Yes; I had it up, myself, this morning. Flew it over to the Bronx and back with a load of supplies.”</p>
				<p>“OK Have somebody you can trust⁠—one of your guards, preferably⁠—bring it around behind the Administration Wing. Captain Prestonby wants it. I’m to take some boys from Fourth Year Civics on a tour. Something about election campaign methods.”</p>
				<p>The instructor called a Literates’ guard and gave him instructions. Yetsko went to the guards’ squad room on the second floor, where he found half a dozen of the reserves loafing.</p>
				<p>“All right; you guys start earning your pay,” he said. “We’re going to a party.”</p>
				<p>The men got to their feet and began gathering their weapons.</p>
				<p>“Mason,” he continued, “you have your big ’copter here; the gang of you can all get in it. I’m taking off in a four-ton truck, with some of these kids. I want you boys to follow us. We’re going to Pelton’s store. There’s a fight going on there, and the captain’s in the middle of it. We gotta get him out.”</p>
				<p>They all looked at him in puzzled surprise, but nobody gave him any argument. Funny, now that he thought of it; it had been quite a long time since anybody had ever given him any argument about anything. A couple of guys out in Pittsburgh had tried it, but somehow they’d lost interest in arguing, after a little⁠—</p>
				<p>When he returned to the office and opened the door, a blast of shots greeted him through the open door of Prestonby’s private office. He had his pistol out before he realized that the shooting was going on at Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise, ten miles away. Literate Martha Collins, in the inner room, was fairly screaming: “Shut that infernal thing off and listen to me!”</p>
				<p>The dozen-odd boys whom Ray had recruited for the improvised relief-expedition were pulling weapons out of the gun locker, pawing through the boxes on the ammunition shelf, trying to explain to one another the working of machine carbines and burp guns. Yetsko shouldered through them and turned down the sound volume of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>.</p>
				<p>“This is absolutely outrageous!” Literate Martha Collins stormed at him. “You ought to be ashamed of yourself, taking these children to a murderous battle like that⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Well, maybe it ain’t right, using savages in a civilized riot,” Yetsko admitted, “but I don’t care. The captain’s in a jam, and I’d use live devils, if I could catch a few.” He took a burp gun from one of the boys, who had opened the action and couldn’t get it closed again. “Here; you kids don’t want this kinda stuff,” he reproved. “Sono guns, and sleep-gas guns, that’s all right. But these things are killing tools!”</p>
				<p>“It’s what we’ll have to use, Doug,” Ray told him. “Things have been happening, since you went out. Look at the screen.”</p>
				<p>Yetsko looked, and swore blisteringly. Then he gave the burp gun back to the boy.</p>
				<p>“Look; you gotta press this little gismo, here, to let the action shut when there’s no clip in, or when the clip’s empty. When you got a loaded clip in, you just pull back on this and let go⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Frank Cardon looked at his watch, and saw that it was 1345, as it had been ten seconds before, when he had last looked. He started to drum nervously on his chair arm with his fingers, then caught himself as he saw Lancedale, who must have been every bit as anxious as himself, standing outwardly calm and unruffled.</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s the situation which now confronts us, brother Literates,” the slender, white-haired man was finishing. “You must see, by now, that the policy of unyielding opposition which some of you have advocated and pursued is futile. You know the policy I favor, which now remains the only policy we can follow; it is summed up in that law of political strategy: If you can’t lick ’em, join ’em, and, after joining, take control.</p>
				<p>“In spite of the Radical-Socialist victory in this state at tomorrow’s election, it will not be possible, in the next Congress, to enact Pelton’s socialized Literacy program into law. The Radicals will not be able to capture enough seats in the lower house, and there are too many uncontested seats in the Senate now held by Independent-Conservatives. But, and this is inevitable, barring some unforeseen accident of the order of a political cataclysm, they will control both houses of Congress after the election of 2144, two years hence, and we can also be sure that two years hence Chester Pelton will be nominated and overwhelmingly elected president of the Consolidated States of North America. Six months thereafter, the socialized Literacy program will be the law of the land.</p>
				<p>“So, we have until mid-2145 to make our preparations. I would estimate that, if we do not destroy ourselves by our own folly in the meantime, we should, two years thereafter, be in complete if secret control of the whole Consolidated States Government. If any of you question that last statement, you can merely ask yourselves one question: How, in the name of all that is rational, can Illiterates control and operate a system of socialized Literacy? Who but Literates can keep such a program from disintegrating into complete and indescribable confusion?</p>
				<p>“I don’t ask for any decision at this time. I do not ask for any debate at this time. Let each of us consider the situation in his or her own mind, and let us meet again a week from today to consider our future course of action, each of us realizing that any decision we take then will determine forever the fate of our Fraternities.” He looked around the room. “Thank you, brother Literates,” he said.</p>
				<p>Instantly, Cardon was on his feet with a motion to recess the meeting until 1300 the following Monday, and Brigade commander Chernov seconded the motion immediately. As soon as Literate President Morehead’s gavel banged, Cardon, still on his feet, was running for the double doors at the rear; the two Literates’ guards on duty there got them unsealed and opened by the time he had reached them.</p>
				<p>There was another guard in the hall, waiting for him with a little record-disk.</p>
				<p>“From Major Slater; call came in about ten minutes ago,” he said.</p>
				<p>Cardon snapped the disk into his recorder-reproducer and put in the ear plug.</p>
				<p>“Frank,” Slater’s voice came out of the small machine. “You’d better get busy, or you won’t have any candidate when the polls open tomorrow. Just got a call from Pelton’s store⁠—place infiltrated by goons, estimated strength two hundred, presumed Independent-Conservatives. Serious rioting already going on; I’m taking my reserve company there. And if you haven’t found out, yet, where China is, it’s on the third floor, next to Glassware.”</p>
				<p>Cardon pulled out the ear plug, stuffed the recorder into his trouser pocket, and began unbuckling his Sam Browne as he ran for the nearest wall visiphone. He was dialing the guard room on that floor with one hand as he took off the belt.</p>
				<p>“Get a big ambulance on the roof, with a Literate medic and orderly-driver,” he ordered, unbuttoning his smock. “And four guards, plain clothes if possible, but don’t waste time changing clothes if you don’t have anybody out of uniform. Heavy-duty sono guns, sleep-gas projectors, gas masks and pistols. Hurry.” He threw the smock and belt at the guard. “Here, Pancho; put these away for me. Thanks.” He tossed the last word back over his shoulder as he ran for the escalator.</p>
				<p>It was three eternal minutes after he had reached the landing stage above before the ambulance arrived, medic and orderly on the front seat and the four guards, all in conservatively cut civilian clothes, inside. He crowded in beside the medic, told him, “Pelton’s store,” and snapped the door shut as the big white ’copter began to rise.</p>
				<p>They climbed to five thousand feet, and then the driver nosed his vehicle up, cut his propeller and retracted it, and fired his rocket, aiming toward downtown Manhattan. Four minutes later, after the rocket stopped firing and they were on the down-curve of their trajectory, the propeller was erected and they began letting down toward the central landing stage of Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise. Cardon cut in the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> and began calling the control tower.</p>
				<p>“Ambulance, to evacuate <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton,” he called. “What’s the score, down there?”</p>
				<p>One of Pelton’s traffic-control men appeared on Cardon’s screen. “You’re safe to land on the central stage, but you’d better come in at a long angle from the north,” he said. “We control the north public stage, but the east and south stages are in the hands of the goons; they’d fire on you. Land beside that big pile of boxes under tarpaulins up here, but be careful; it’s fireworks we didn’t have time to get into storage.”</p>
				<p>The ambulance came slanting in from uptown, and Cardon looked around anxiously. The Mayfly dance of customers’ ’copters had stopped; there was a Sabbath stillness about the big store, at least visually. A few small figures in Literates’ guards black leather moved about on the north landing stage, and several Pelton employees were on the central stop stage. The howling of the ’copter propeller overhead effectively blocked out any sounds that might be coming from the building, at least until the ambulance landed. Then a spatter of firing from below was audible.</p>
				<p>Cardon, the medic and the guards piled out, the latter with the stretcher. The orderly-driver got out his tablet pistol and checked the chamber, then settled into a posture of watchful relaxation. Major Slater was waiting for them by one of the vertical lift platforms.</p>
				<p>“I tried to get hold of you, but that blasted meeting was going on, and they had the doors sealed, and⁠—” he began.</p>
				<p>Cardon hushed him quickly. “Around here, I’m an Illiterate,” he warned. “Where’s Pelton? We’ve got to get him and his daughter out of here, at once.”</p>
				<p>“He’s still flat on his back, out cold,” Slater said. “The medic you sent around here gave him a shot of hypnotaine: he’ll be out for a couple of hours, yet. Prestonby’s still here. He’s commanding the defense; doing a good job, too.”</p>
				<p>That was good. Ralph would help get Claire to Literates’ Hall, after they’d gotten her father to safety.</p>
				<p>“There must be about five hundred Independent-Conservative storm troopers in the store,” Slater was saying. “Most of them got here after we did. The city cops have all the street approaches roped off; they’re letting nobody but Grant Hamilton’s thugs in.”</p>
				<p>“They were fairly friendly this morning,” Cardon said. “Mayor Jameson must have passed the word.” They all got off the lift two floors down, where they found Claire Pelton and Ralph Prestonby waiting. “Hello, Ralph. Claire. What’s the situation?”</p>
				<p>“We have all the twelfth floor,” Prestonby said. “We have about half the eleventh, including the north and west public stages. We have the basement and the storerooms and the warehouse⁠—Sergeant Coccozello’s down there, with as many of the store police and Literates and Literates’ guards and store-help as he could salvage, and the warehouse gang. They’ve taken most of the ground floor, the main mezzanine, and parts of the second floor. We moved two of the 7-<abbr>mm</abbr> machine guns down from the top, and we control the front street entrance with them and a couple of sono guns. The store’s isolated from the outside by the city police, who are allowing reinforcements to come through for the raiders, but we’re managing to stop them at the doors.”</p>
				<p>“Have you called Radical-Socialist headquarters for help?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, half a dozen times. There’s some fellow named Yingling there, who says that all their storm troops are over in North Jersey, on some kind of a false-alarm riot-call, and can’t be contacted.”</p>
				<p>“So?” Cardon commented gently. “That’s too bad, now.” Too bad for Horace Yingling and Joe West; this time tomorrow, they’ll be a pair of dead traitors, he thought. “Well, we’ll have to make do with what we have. Where’s Russ Latterman, by the way?”</p>
				<p>Prestonby gave a sidewise glance toward Claire and shook his head, his lips pressed tightly together. <q>She doesn’t know, yet</q>, Cardon interpreted.</p>
				<p>“Down in the basement, with Coccozello,” Prestonby said, aloud. “We’re in telephone communication with Coccozello, and have a freight elevator running between here and the basement. Coccozello says Latterman is using a rifle against the raiders, killing everyone he can get a shot at.”</p>
				<p>Cardon nodded. Probably vindictive about being involved in action injurious to Pelton’s commercial interests; just another odd quirk of Literate ethics.</p>
				<p>“We’d better get him up here,” he said. “You and I have got to leave, at once; we have to get Pelton and Claire to safety. He can help Major Slater till we can get back with reinforcements. I am going to kill a man named Horace Yingling, and then I’m going to round up the storm troops he diverted on a wild-goose chase to North Jersey.” He nodded to the medic and the four plain-clothes guards. “Get Pelton on the stretcher. Better use the canvas flaps and the straps. He’s under hypnotaine, but it’s likely to be a rough trip. Claire, get anything you want to take with you. Ralph will take you where you’ll be safe for a while.”</p>
				<p>“But the store⁠—” Claire began.</p>
				<p>“Your father has riot-insurance, doesn’t he? I know he does; they doubled the premium on him when he came out for Senate. Let the insurance company worry about the store.”</p>
				<p>The medic and the guards moved into Chester Pelton’s private rest room with the stretcher. Claire went to the desk and began picking up odds and ends, including the pistol Cardon had given her, and putting them in her handbag.</p>
				<p>“We’ve got to keep her away from her father, for a few days, Ralph,” he told Prestonby softly. “It’s all over town that she can read and write. We’ve got to give him a chance to cool off before he sees her again. Take her to Lancedale. I have everything fixed up; she’ll be admitted to the Fraternities this afternoon, and given Literate protection.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby grabbed his hand impulsively. “Frank! I’ll never be able to repay you for this, not if I live to be a thousand⁠—” he began.</p>
				<p>There was a sudden blast of sound from overhead⁠—the banging of machine guns, the bark of the store’s 20-<abbr>mm</abbr> auto-cannon, the howling of airplane jets, and the crash of explosions. Everybody in the room jerked up and stood frozen, then Prestonby jumped for the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>-screen and pawed at the dials. A moment later, after the screen flashed and went black twice, they were looking across the topside landing stage from a pickup at one corner.</p>
				<p>A slim fighter-bomber, with square-tipped, backswept, wings, was jetting up in almost perpendicular flight; another was coming in toward the landing stage, and, as they watched, a flight of rockets leaped forward from under its wings. Cardon saw the orderly-driver of the ambulance jump down and start to run for the open lift-shaft. He got five steps away from his vehicle. Then the rockets came in, and one of them struck the tarpaulin-covered pile of boxes beside the ambulance. There was a flash of multicolored flame, in which the man and the vehicle he had left both vanished. Immediately, the screen went black.</p>
				<p>The fireworks had mostly exploded at the first blast; however, when Cardon and Major Slater and one or two others reached the top landing stage, there were still explosions. A thing the size and shape of a two-gallon kettle, covered with red paper, came rolling toward them, and suddenly let go with a blue-green flash, throwing a column of smoke, in miniature imitation of an A-bomb, into the air. Something about three feet long came whizzing at them on the end of a tail of fire, causing them to fling themselves flat; involuntarily, Cardon’s head jerked about and his eyes followed it until it blew up with a flash and a bang three blocks uptown. Here and there, colored fire flared, small rockets flew about, and firecrackers popped.</p>
				<p>The ambulance was gone, blown clear off the roof. The other ’copters on the landing stage were a tangled mass of wreckage. The 20-<abbr>mm</abbr> was toppled over; the gunner was dead, and one of the crew, half-dazed, was trying to drag a third man from under the overturned gun. The control tower, with the two 12-<abbr>mm</abbr> machine guns, was wrecked. The two 7-<abbr>mm</abbr>’s that had been left on the top had vanished, along with the machine gunners, in a hole that had been blown in the landing stage.</p>
				<p>Cardon, Slater, and the others dashed forward and pulled the auto-cannon off the injured man, hauling him and his companion over to the lift. The two rakish-winged fighter-bombers were returning, spraying the roof with machine-gun bullets, and behind them came a procession of fifteen big ’copters. They dropped the lift hastily; Slater jumped off when it was still six feet above the floor, and began shouting orders.</p>
				<p>“Falk: take ten men and get to the head of this lift-shaft! Burdick, Levine: get as many men as you can in thirty seconds, and get up to the head of the escalator! Diaz: go down and tell Sternberg to bring all his gang up here!”</p>
				<p>Cardon caught up a rifle and rummaged for a bandolier of ammunition, losing about a minute in the search. The delay was fortunate; when he got to the escalators, he was met by a rush of men hurrying down the ascending spiral or jumping over onto the descending one.</p>
				<p>“Sono guns!” one of them was shouting. “They have the escalator head covered; you’ll get knocked out before you get off the spiral!”</p>
				<p>He turned and looked toward the freight lift. It was coming down again, with Falk and his men unconscious on it, knocked senseless by bludgeons of inaudible sound, and a half a dozen of the ’copter-borne raiders, all wearing the white robes and hoods of the Independent-Conservative storm troops. He swung his rifle up and began squeezing the trigger, remembering to first make sure that the fire-control lever was set forward for semi-auto, and remembering his advice to Goodkin, that morning. By the time the platform had stopped, all the men in white robes were either dead or wounded, and none of the unconscious Literates’ guards along with them had been injured. The medic who had come with Cardon, assisted by a couple of the office force, got the casualties sorted out. There was nothing that could be done about the men who had been sono-stunned; in half an hour or so, they would recover consciousness with no ill effects that a couple of headache tablets wouldn’t set right.</p>
				<p>The situation, while bad, was not immediately desperate. If the white-clad raiders controlled the top landing stage, they were pinned down by the firearms and sono guns of the defenders, below, who were in a position to stop anything that came down the escalators or the lift shaft. The fate of the first party was proof of that. And the very magnitude of the riot guaranteed that somebody on the outside, city police, State guards, or even Consolidated States regulars, would be taking a hand shortly. The air attack and ’copter-landing on the roof had been excellent tactics, but it had been a serious policy-blunder. As long as the disturbance had been confined to the interior of the store, the city police could shrug it off as another minor riot on property supposed to be protected by private police, and do nothing about it. The rocket-attack on the top landing stage and the spectacular explosion of the fireworks temporarily stored there, however, was something that simply couldn’t be concealed or dismissed. The cloud of varicolored smoke alone must have been visible all over the five original boroughs of the older New York, and there were probably rumors of atom-bombing going around.</p>
				<p>“What gets me,” Slater, who must have been thinking about the same thing, said to Cardon, “is where they got hold of those two fighter-bombers. That kind of stuff isn’t supposed to be in private hands.”</p>
				<p>“A couple of hundred years ago, they had something they called the Sullivan Law,” Cardon told him. “Private citizens weren’t even allowed to own pistols. But the gangsters and hoodlums seemed to be able to get hold of all the pistols they wanted, and burp guns, too. I know of four or five racket gangs in this area that have aircraft like that, based up in the Adirondacks, at secret fields. Anybody who has connections with one of those gangs can order an air attack like this on an hour’s notice, if he’s able to pay for it. What I can’t understand is the Independent-Conservatives doing anything like this. The facts about this business will be all over the state before the polls open tomorrow⁠—” He snapped his fingers suddenly. “Come on; let’s have a look at those fellows who came down on the lift!”</p>
				<p>There were two dead men in white Independent-Conservative robes and hoods, lying where they had been dragged from the lift platform. Cardon pulled off the hoods and zipped open the white robes. One of the men was a complete stranger; the other, however, was a man he had seen, earlier in the day, at the Manhattan headquarters of the Radical-Socialist Party. One of the Consolidated Illiterates’ Organization people; a follower of West and Yingling.</p>
				<p>“So that’s how it was!” he said, straightening. “Now I get it! Let’s go see if any of those wounded goons are in condition to be questioned.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Ray Pelton and Doug Yetsko had their heads out an open window on the right side of the cab of the ’copter truck; Ray was pointing down.</p>
				<p>“That roof, over there, looks like a good place to land,” he said. “We can get down the fire escape, and the hatch to the conveyor belt is only half a block away.”</p>
				<p>Yetsko nodded. There’d be a watchman, or a private cop, in the building on which Ray intended landing. A couple of hundred dollars would take care of him, and they could leave two of Mason’s boys with the vehicles to see that he stayed bribed.</p>
				<p>“Sure we can get in on the freight conveyor?” he asked. “Maybe it’ll be guarded.”</p>
				<p>“Then we’ll have to crawl in through the cable conduit,” Ray said. “I’ve done that, lots of times; so have most of the other guys.” He nodded toward the body of the truck, behind, where his dozen-odd teenage recruits were riding. “I’ve played all over the store, ever since I’ve been big enough to walk; I must know more about it than anybody but the guy who built it. That’s why I said we’d have to bring bullet guns; down where we’re going, we’d gas ourselves with gas guns, and if we used sono guns, we’d knock ourselves out with the echo.”</p>
				<p>“You know, Ray, you’ll make a real storm trooper,” Yetsko said. “If you manage to stay alive for another ten years, you’ll be almost as good a storm troop captain as Captain Prestonby.”</p>
				<p>That, Ray knew, was about as high praise as Doug Yetsko could give anybody. He’d have liked to ask Doug more about Captain Prestonby⁠—Doug could never seem to get used to the idea of his officer being a schoolteacher⁠—but there was no time. The ’copter truck was already settling onto the roof.</p>
				<p>The watchman proved amenable to reason. He took one look at Yetsko, with three feet of weighted fire hose in his hand, and gulped, then accepted the two C-notes Yetsko gave him. They left a couple of Literates’ guards with the vehicles, and Ray led the way to the fire escape, and down into the alley. A few hundred feet away, there was an iron grating which they pulled up. Ray drew the pistol he had gotten out of Captain Prestonby’s arms locker and checked the magazine, chamber, and safety, knowing that Yetsko and the other guards were watching him critically, and then started climbing down the ladder.</p>
				<p>The conduit was halfway down. Yetsko, climbing behind him, examined it with his flashlight, probably wondering how he was going to fit himself into a hole like that. They climbed down onto the concrete walkway beside the conveyor belts, and in the dim light of the overhead lamps Ray could see that the two broad belts, to and from the store, were empty for as far as he could see in either direction. Normally, there should be things moving constantly in both directions⁠—big wire baskets full of parcels for delivery, and trash containers, going out, and bales and crates and cases of merchandise, and empty delivery baskets and trash containers coming in. He pointed this out to Yetsko.</p>
				<p>“Sure,” the big Literates’ guards sergeant nodded. “They got control of the opening from the terminal, and they probably got a gang up at the other end, too,” he shouted, over the noise of the conveyor belts. “I hope they haven’t got into the basement of the store.”</p>
				<p>“If they have, I know a way to get in,” Ray told him. “You’d better stay here for about five minutes, and let me scout ahead. We don’t want to run into a big gang of them ahead.”</p>
				<p>Yetsko shook his head. “No, Ray; the captain told me I was to stick with you. I’ll go along with you. And we better take another of these kids, for a runner, in case we have to send word back.”</p>
				<p>“Ramón, you come with us,” Ray said. “The rest of you, stay here for five minutes, and then, if you don’t hear from us, follow us.”</p>
				<p>“Mason, you take over,” Yetsko told the guards corporal. “And keep an eye out behind you. We’re in a sandwich, here; they’re behind us, and in front of us. If anything comes at you from behind, send the kids forward to the next conduit port.”</p>
				<p>Ray and Yetsko and Ramón Nogales started forward. Halfway to the next conduit port, there was a smear of lubricating oil on the concrete, and in it, and away from it in the direction of the store, they found footprints. It was Ramón Nogales who noticed the oil on the ladder to the next conduit port.</p>
				<p>“You stick here,” Yetsko told him, “and when Mason and the others come up, hold them here. Tell Mason to send one of the guards forward, and use the rest of the gang to grab anybody who comes out. Come on, Ray.”</p>
				<p>At the port beyond, they halted, waiting for Mason’s man to come up. They lost some time, thereafter, but they learned that the section of conduit between the two ports was empty and that the main telephone line to the store had been cut. Whoever had cut it had gone, either forward or back away from the store. A little farther on, the sound of shots ahead became audible over the clanking and rattling of the conveyor belts.</p>
				<p>“Well, I guess this is where we start crawling,” Yetsko said. “Your father’s people seem to be holding the store basement against a gang in the conveyor tunnel.”</p>
				<p>One of the boys scouted ahead, and returned to report that they could reach the next conduit port, but that the section of both conveyor belts ahead of him was stopped, apparently wedged.</p>
				<p>Yetsko stood for a moment, grimacing in an effort to reach a decision.</p>
				<p>“I’d like to just go forward and hit them from behind,” he said. “But I don’t know how many of them there are, and we’d have to be careful, shooting into them, that we didn’t shoot up your father’s gang, beyond them. I wish⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Well, let’s go through the conduit, then,” Ray said. “We can slide down a branch conduit that runs a power line into the basement. I’ll go ahead; everybody at the store knows me, and they don’t know you. They might shoot you before they found out you were a friend.”</p>
				<p>Before Yetsko could object, he started up the ladder, Yetsko behind him and the others following. At the next conduit port, they could hear shooting very plainly, seeming to be in front of them. At the next one, the shooting seemed to be going on directly under them, in the tunnel. With the flashlight Yetsko had passed forward to him, Ray could see that the dust on the concrete floor of the three-foot by three-foot passage between and under the power and telephone cables was undisturbed.</p>
				<p>A little farther on, there was an opening on the left, and a power cable branched off downward, at a sharp angle, overhead. Ray was able to turn about and get his feet in front of him; Yetsko had to crawl on until he had passed it, and then back into it after Ray had entered. Bracing one foot on either side, Ray inched his way down the forty-degree slope, hoping that the two hundred pound weight of Doug Yetsko wouldn’t start sliding upon him.</p>
				<p>Ahead, he could hear voices. He drew his hands and feet away from the sides of the branch conduit and let himself slip, landing in a heap in the electricians’ shop, above the furnace rooms. Two men, who had been working at a bench, trying to assemble a mass of equipment into a radio, whirled, snatching weapons. Ray knew both of them⁠—Sam Jacobowitz and George Nyman, who serviced the store’s communications equipment. They both stared at him, swearing in amazement.</p>
				<p>“All right, Doug!” Ray called out. “We’re in! Bring the gang down!”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Frank Cardon and Ralph Prestonby were waiting at the freight-elevator door when it opened and Russell Latterman emerged, a rifle slung over one shoulder. Cardon stepped forward and took the rifle from him.</p>
				<p>“Come on over here, Russ,” he said. “And don’t do anything reckless.”</p>
				<p>They led him to one side. Latterman looked from one to the other apprehensively, licking his lips.</p>
				<p>“It’s all right; we’re not going to hurt you, Russ,” Cardon assured him. “We just want a few facts. Beside rigging that business with Bayne, and almost killing Chet Pelton, and forcing Claire to blow her cover, how much did you have to do with this business?”</p>
				<p>“And who put you up to it?” Prestonby wanted to know. “My guess is Joyner and Graves. Am I right?”</p>
				<p>“Graves,” Latterman said. “Joyner didn’t have anything to do with it; didn’t know anything about it. He’s in charge of the Retail Merchandising section, and any action like this would be unethical, since Pelton’s is a client of the Retail Merchandising section. All Graves told me to do was fix up a situation, using my own judgment, that would provoke a Literate strike and force either Claire or Frank here to betray Literacy. But I had no idea that it would involve a riot like this. If I had, I’d have stood on Literates’ ethics and refused to have any part in it.”</p>
				<p>“That’s about how I thought it would be,” Cardon nodded. “Graves probably was informed by Literates with the Independent-Conservatives that this riot was planned; he wanted to get our people out of the store. Unfortunately for him, he wasn’t present at the extemporary meeting that reversed Bayne’s action in calling the strike.” He handed the rifle back to Latterman. “I just took this in case you might get excited, before I could explain. And you can forget about the Graves-Joyner opposition to Pelton. We had a meeting, right after noon. Lancedale gained the upper hand; Joyner and Graves are cooperating, now; the plan is to support Pelton and get on the inside of the socialized Literacy program, when it’s enacted.”</p>
				<p>“I still think that’s a suicidal policy,” Latterman said. “But not as suicidal as splitting the Fraternities and trying to follow two policies simultaneously. I wonder if I could put a call through to Literates’ Hall without some of these picture-readers overhearing me.”</p>
				<p>“You’ve been out of touch, down in the cellar, Russ.” Prestonby told him. “Our telephone line’s cut, and the radio is smashed.” He told Latterman about the rocket attack on the control tower, which also housed the store’s telecast station. “So we’re sandwiched, here; one gang has us blocked at the twelfth floor, and another gang’s up on the roof, trying to get down at us from above, and we’ve no way to communicate with the outside. We can pick up the regular telecasts, but nobody outside seems to be paying much attention to us.”</p>
				<p>“There’s a lot of equipment down in the electricians’ shop,” Latterman said. “Maybe we could rig up a sending set that could contact one of the telecast stations outside.”</p>
				<p>“That’s an idea,” Prestonby said. “Let’s see what we can do about it.”</p>
				<p>They went into Pelton’s office. The store owner was still lying motionless on his stretcher. Claire was fiddling with a telecast receiving set; she had just tuned out a lecture on Home Beautifications and had gotten the midsection of a serial in which three couples were somewhat confused over just who was married to whom.</p>
				<p>“Nobody seems to realize what’s happening to us!” she said, turning the knob again. Then she froze, as Elliot <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Mongery⁠—this time sponsored by Parc, the Miracle Cleanser⁠—appeared on the screen.</p>
				<p>“… And it seems that the attack on Chester Pelton has picked up new complications; somebody seems determined to wipe out the whole Pelton family, because, only ten minutes ago, some twenty armed men invaded the Mineola High School, where Pelton’s fifteen-year-old son, Raymond, is a student, and forced their way to the office of Literate First Class Ralph <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">N.</abbr> Prestonby, in an attempt to kidnap young Pelton. Neither Literate Prestonby, the principal, nor the Pelton boy, who was supposed to be in his office, could be found. The raiders were put to flight by the presence of mind of Literate Martha <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">B.</abbr> Collins, who pressed the button which turned on the fire alarm, filling the halls with a mob of students. The interlopers fled in panic after being set upon and almost mobbed⁠—”</p>
				<p>Prestonby looked worried. “I left Ray in my office, with Doug Yetsko,” he said. “I can’t understand⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Maybe Yetsko got a tip that they were coming and got Ray out of the school,” Cardon suggested. “I hope he took him home.” He caught himself just in time to avoid mentioning the platoon of Literates’ guards at the Pelton home, which he was not supposed to know about. “Don’t worry, Claire; if anything’d happened to Ray, Mongery’d have been screaming about it to high heaven. That’s what he’s paid to do.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I’ll stake my life on it; if anybody tried to do anything to Ray while Yetsko was with him, you’d have heard about it,” Prestonby said. “It’d have been a bigger battle than this one.”</p>
				<p>“… Can’t seem to find out anything about what’s going on at Pelton’s store,” Mongery continued. “Telephone and radio communication seems to be broken, and, although there is continuous firing going on inside the building, the city police, who have a cordon completely around it, say that the situation in the store is well in hand. Considering Chester Pelton’s attacks on the city administration and particularly the police department, I leave to your imagination what they mean by that. We do know that a large body of unidentified plug-uglies whom Police Inspector Cassidy claims are ‘special officers’ are holding the conveyor line into the store at the downtown Manhattan terminal, and nobody seems to know what’s going on at the other end⁠—”</p>
				<p>“They have the sections of both belts at the store entrance end wedged,” Latterman said, coming up at the moment. “Coccozello has a barricade thrown up across the store end of the tunnel, and they have a barricade about fifty yards down the tunnel. That’s where I was fighting when you called me up.”</p>
				<p>“Anything being done about gold-berging up a radio sending-set?” Prestonby asked.</p>
				<p>“Yes. I just called Coccozello,” Latterman said. “Fortunately, the inter-department telephone is still working. He’s put a couple of men to work, and thinks he may have a set in operation in about half an hour.”</p>
				<p>“… And if, as I much fear, Chester Pelton has been murdered, then I advise all listening to me to go to the polls tomorrow and vote the straight Anarchist ticket. If we’ve got to have anarchy in this country, let’s have anarchy for all, and not just for Grant Hamilton and his political adherents!” Mongery was saying.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>There was a series of heavy explosions on the floor above. Everybody grabbed weapons and hurried outside, crowding onto the escalators. The floor above was a shambles, with bodies lying about, and the descending escalator was packed with white-robed attackers, who had apparently prepared for their charge by tossing down a number of heavy fragmentation bombs. Cardon had a burp gun, this time; he emptied the fifty-shot magazine into the hooded hoodlums who were coming down. Prestonby, beside him, had a heavy sono gun; he kept it trained on the head of the escalator and held the trigger back until it was empty, then slapped in a fresh clip of the small blank cartridges which produced the sound waves that were amplified and altered to stunning vibrations. Still, many of the attackers got through. More were dropping down the lift-platform shaft. Cardon’s submachine-gun ceased firing, the action open on an empty clip. He dropped it and yanked the heavy pistol from his shoulder holster. Then, from the direction of the freight elevator, reinforcements arrived, headed by a huge man in the black leather of the Literates’ guard, who swung a three-foot length of fire hose with his right hand and fired a pistol with his left, and a boy in a black-and-red jacket who was letting off a burp gun in deliberate, parsimonious, bursts. It was a second or two before Cardon recognized them as Prestonby’s bodyguard, Doug Yetsko, and Claire Pelton’s brother Ray. There were four Literates’ guards and about a dozen boys with them, all firing with a variety of weapons.</p>
				<p>At the same time, others were arriving on the escalators from the floors below, firing as they came off⁠—Slater’s Literates’ guards, the Literates and their black-jacketed troopers of Hopkinson’s store service crew, the fifteen survivors of the twenty riflemen from Macy &amp; Gimbel’s. The attackers turned and crowded onto the ascending escalator. Most of them got away, the casualties being carried up by the escalator. Doug Yetsko bounded forward and brought his fire hose down on the back of one invader’s neck. Then, after a last spatter of upward-aimed shots from the defenders, there was silence.</p>
				<p>Cardon stepped forward and yanked the hood from the man whom Yetsko had knocked down, hoping that he had a stunned prisoner who could be interrogated. The man was dead, however, with a broken neck. For a moment, Cardon looked down at the heavy, brutal features of Joe West, the Illiterates’ Organization man. If Chester Pelton got out of this mess alive and won the election tomorrow, there was going to have to be a purge in the Radical-Socialist party, and something was going to have to be done about the Consolidated Organization of Illiterates. He turned to Yetsko.</p>
				<p>“You and your gang got here just in the nick of time,” he said. “How did you get into the store?”</p>
				<p>“Through the freight conveyor, into the basement.”</p>
				<p>“But I thought those goons had both ends of that plugged.”</p>
				<p>“They did,” Yetsko grinned. “But Ray Pelton took us in at the middle, and we crawled through a cable conduit to get around the gang at this end.”</p>
				<p>Cardon looked around quickly, in search of Ray. The boy, having come out of the excitement of battle, was looking around at the litter of dead and wounded on the blood-splashed floor. His eyes widened, and he gulped. Then, carefully setting the safety of his burp gun and slinging it, he went over and leaned against the wall, and was sick.</p>
				<p>Prestonby, with Claire Pelton beside him, started toward the white-faced, retching boy. Yetsko put out a hamlike hand to stop them.</p>
				<p>“If the kid wants to be sick, let him be sick,” he said. “He’s got a right to. I was sicker’n that, after my first fight. But he won’t do that the next time.”</p>
				<p>“There isn’t going to be any next time!” Claire declared, with maternal protectiveness.</p>
				<p>“That’s what you think, Miss Claire,” Yetsko told her. “That boy’s gonna make a great storm trooper,” he declared. “Every bit as great as Captain Prestonby, here.”</p>
				<p>Claire looked up at Prestonby almost worshipfully. “And I never knew anything about your being a fighting-man, till today,” she said. “Ralph, there’s so much about you that I don’t know.”</p>
				<p>“There’ll be plenty of time to find out, now, honey,” he told her.</p>
				<p>Cardon stepped over the body of Joe West and went up to them.</p>
				<p>“Sorry to intrude on you two,” he said, “but we’ve got to figure on how to get out of here. Could we get out the same way you got in?” he asked Yetsko. “And take <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton with us?”</p>
				<p>Yetsko frowned. “Part of the way, we gotta crawl through this conduit; it’s only about a yard square. And we’d have to go up a ladder, and out a manhole, to get out of the conveyor tunnel. What sorta shape’s <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Pelton in?”</p>
				<p>“He’s under hypnotaine, completely unconscious,” Prestonby said.</p>
				<p>“Then we’d have to drag him,” Yetsko said. “Strap him up in a tarp, or load him into a sleeping bag, if we can get hold of one.”</p>
				<p>“There are plenty, down in the warehouse,” Latterman interrupted, joining them. “And the warehouse is in our hands.”</p>
				<p>“All right,” Cardon decided. “We’ll take him out, now, and take him home. I have some men there who’ll take care of him. We’ll have to get you and Ray out, too,” he told Claire. “I think we’ll take both of you to Literates’ Hall; you’ll be absolutely safe there.”</p>
				<p>“But the store,” Claire started to object. “And all these people who came here to help us⁠—”</p>
				<p>“As soon as I have your father home, I’m going to start rounding up a gang to raise the siege,” Cardon said. “Radical-Socialist storm troops, and⁠—” He grinned suddenly. “The insurance company; the one that has the store insured against riot! Why didn’t I think of them before? They’re losing money every second this thing goes on. It’ll be worth their while to start doing something to stop it!”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The trip out through the conduit was not so difficult, even with the encumbrance of the unconscious Chester Pelton, but Prestonby was convinced that, except for the giant strength of Doug Yetsko, it would have been nearly impossible. Ray Pelton, recovered from his after-battle nausea and steeled by responsibility, went first. Cardon crawled after him, followed by a couple of the boys. Then came Yetsko, dragging the sleeping bag in which Chester Pelton was packed like a mummy. Prestonby himself followed, pushing on his future father-in-law’s feet, and Claire crawled behind, with the rest of Ray’s schoolmates for a rearguard.</p>
				<p>They got past the battle which was still going on at the entrance to the store basement, letting Pelton down with a rope and carrying him onto the outward-bound belt. They left it in time to assemble under the ladder leading to the alley through which Ray said they had entered, and hauled Pelton up after them. Then, when they were all out in the open again, Ray ran up the alley and mounted a fire escape, and, in a few minutes, a big ’copter truck which had been parked on the roof let down to them. Into this, Cardon ordered the unconscious senatorial candidate loaded, and the boys who had come with Ray.</p>
				<p>“I’ll take him home, and then run the boys to the school,” he told Prestonby. “You and Ray and Claire get in this other ’copter and go straight to Literates’ Hall.” He pointed up to the passenger vehicle which was hovering above, waiting for the truck to leave. “Go in the church way, and go straight to Lancedale’s office. And here.” He scribbled an address and a phone number and a couple of names. “These men have my ’copter at this address. Call them as soon as you get to Literates’ Hall and have them take it at once to Pelton’s home, on Long Island.”</p>
				<p>Prestonby nodded and watched Cardon climb into the truck. The Literates’ guard who was driving lifted it up and began windmilling away toward the east. The passenger ’copter, driven by another guard from the school, settled down. Putting Ray and Claire into it, he climbed in after them.</p>
				<p>“Ray,” he said, “how would you like to be a real white-smock Literate?”</p>
				<p>Ray’s eyes opened. “You think I’m good enough?”</p>
				<p>“Good enough to be a novice, to start with. And I don’t think you’ll stay a novice long.”</p>
				<p>Claire looked at him inquiringly, saying nothing.</p>
				<p>“You, too, honey,” he said. “Frank fixed it all up. You and Ray will be admitted to the Fraternities, this afternoon. And that will remove any objection to our being married.”</p>
				<p>“But⁠ ⁠… how about the Senator?” she asked.</p>
				<p>Prestonby shrugged. “It’s all over the state now that you can read; there’s nothing that you can do about it. And Frank has a lot of influence with him; he’ll talk him around to where he’ll be willing to make the best of it, in a week or so.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Russell Latterman noticed that Major Slater was looking at him in a respectfully inquiring manner. He said nothing, and, at length, the Literates’ guards officer broke the silence.</p>
				<p>“You didn’t go out with the others.”</p>
				<p>Latterman shook his head. “No, major; I’m an executive of Pelton’s Purchasers’ Paradise, however unlike its name it may look at the moment. My job’s here. I’m afraid I’ll have to lean pretty heavily on you, until <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Cardon can get help to us. I’m not particularly used to combat.”</p>
				<p>“You’ve been doing all right with that rifle,” Slater told him.</p>
				<p>“I can hit what I aim at, yes. But I’m not used to commanding men in combat, and I’m not much of a tactician.”</p>
				<p>Slater thrust out his hand impulsively. “I took a sort of poor view of you, at first. I’m sorry,” he said. “Want me to take command?”</p>
				<p>“If you please, major.”</p>
				<p>“What are you going to do, after this thing’s over?” Slater asked.</p>
				<p>“Stay on with Pelton’s, provided <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:surname">P.</abbr> doesn’t find out that I organized that trick with his medicine and the safe,” Latterman said. “Since Lancedale seems to have gotten on top at the Hall, I am, as of now, a Lancedale partisan. That’s partly opportunism, and it’s partly because, since a single policy has been adopted, I feel obliged to go along with it. I’ll have to get the store back in operation, as soon as possible. Pelton’s going to need money, badly, if he’s going to try for the presidency in ’44.” He looked around him. “You know, I’ve always wanted to run a fire sale; this’ll be even better⁠—a battle sale!”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Cardon watched Chester Pelton apprehensively as the bald-headed merchant and senatorial candidate sipped from the tall glass in his hand and then set it on the table beside him. His face was pale, and he had the look of a man who has just been hit with a blackjack.</p>
				<p>“That’s an awful load of bricks to dump on a man, all at once, Frank,” he said reproachfully.</p>
				<p>“You’d rather I told you, now, than turn on the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr> and hear some commentator talking about it, wouldn’t you?” Cardon asked.</p>
				<p>Pelton swore vilely, in a lifeless monotone, cursing Literacy, and all Literates back to the invention of the alphabet. Then he stopped short.</p>
				<p>“No, Frank, I don’t mean that, either. My own son and daughter are Literates; I can’t say that about them. But how long⁠—?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, for about a year, I’d say. I understand, now, that they were admitted to the Fraternities six months ago,” he invented.</p>
				<p>“And they were working against me, all that time?” Pelton demanded.</p>
				<p>Cardon shook his head. “No, Chet; they were for you, all the way. Your daughter exposed her Literacy to save your life. Your son and his teacher came to your store and fought for you. But there are Literates who want to see you defeated, and they’re the ones who made that audiovisual, secretly, of the ceremony in which your son and daughter took the Literates’ Oath and received the white smock, and they’re going to telecast it this evening at twenty-one hundred. Coming on top of the stories that have been going around all afternoon, and Slade Gardner’s speech, this morning, they think that’ll be enough to defeat you.”</p>
				<p>“Well, don’t you?” Pelton gloomed. “My own kids, Literates!” He seemed to have reached a point at which he was actually getting a masochistic pleasure out of turning the dagger in his wounds. “Who’d trust me, after this?”</p>
				<p>“No, Chet; it isn’t enough to beat you⁠—if you just throw away that crying towel and start fighting. They made one mistake that’s going to wreck them.”</p>
				<p>“What’s that, Frank?” Pelton brightened, by about one angstrom unit.</p>
				<p>“The timing, of course!” Cardon told him, impatiently. “I thought you’d see that, at once. This telecast comes on at twenty-one hundred. Your final speech comes on at twenty-one thirty. As soon as they’ve shown this business of Claire and Ray taking the Literate Oath, you’ll be on the air, yourself, and if you put on any kind of a show worth the name, it won’t be safe for anybody in this state to be caught wearing a white smock. Now, if they’d only had the wit to wait till after you’d delivered that speech you’ve been practicing on for the last two weeks, and then spring this on you, that would have been different. They’d have had you over a barrel. But this way, you have them!”</p>
				<p>Pelton took another gulp from the tall glass at his elbow, emptying it. “Fix me up another of these, Frank,” he said. “I feel like a new man, already.” Then his face clouded again. “But we have no time to prepare a speech, now, and I just can’t ad lib one.”</p>
				<p>Cardon drew a little half-inch record-disk from his pocket case.</p>
				<p>“Play this off,” he said. “I had it fixed up, as soon as I got wise to what was going to happen. The voice is one of the girls in my office, over at the brewery. Pronunciation, grammar, elocution and everything correct.”</p>
				<p>Pelton snapped the disk onto his recorder and put in the ear plug. Then, before he pressed the stud, he looked at Cardon curiously.</p>
				<p>“How’d you get onto this, anyhow, Frank?” he wanted to know.</p>
				<p>“Well.⁠ ⁠… I hope you don’t ask me for an accounting of all the money I’ve been spending in this campaign, because some of the items would look funny as hell, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>“No accounting, Frank. After all, you spent as much of your own money as you did of mine,” Pelton interrupted.</p>
				<p>“… But I bought myself a pipe line into Literates’ Hall big enough to chase an elephant through,” Cardon went on, ignoring the interruption. “This fellow Mongery, for instance.” Elliot Mongery was one of Literate Frank Cardon’s best friends; he comforted his conscience with the knowledge that Mongery would slander him just as unscrupulously, if the interests of the Lancedale Plan were at stake. “I have Mongery just like this.” He made a clutching and lifting gesture, as though he were picking up some small animal by the scruff of the neck. “So, as soon as I got word of it, I started getting this thing together. It isn’t the kind of a job a Literate semanticist would do, but it’s all honest Illiterate thinking, in Illiterate language. Turn it on, and tell me what you think of it.”</p>
				<p>While Pelton listened to the record, Cardon mixed him another of the highballs, adding a little of the heart-stimulant the medic had given him. Pelton was grinning savagely when he turned off the little machine and took out the ear plug.</p>
				<p>“Great stuff, Frank! And I won’t have to ham it much; it’s just about the way I feel.” He thought for a moment. “You have me talking about my ruined store, there. Just how bad is it, anyhow?”</p>
				<p>“Pretty bad, Chet. Latterman says it’s going to take some time to get it fixed up, but he expects to be open for business by Thursday or Friday. He’s going to put on a big Battle Sale; he says it’s going to make retail-merchandising history. And the insurance covers most of the damage.”</p>
				<p>“Well, tell me about it. How did you get the riot stopped, after you got me out? And how did you⁠—?”</p>
				<p>Cardon shook his head. “You play that record over again; get yourself in the mood. When you go on, we’ll have you in a chair, wrapped in a blanket⁠ ⁠… you’re supposed to have crawled back out of the Valley of the Shadow of Death to make this speech⁠ ⁠… and we’ll have the wire run down inside the blanket, so that you can listen to the speech while you’re giving it. Chet, this is going to be one of the great political speeches of all time⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Literate William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lancedale looked up from his desk and greeted his visitor with a smile.</p>
				<p>“Well, Frank! Sit down and accept congratulations! I suppose you got the returns?”</p>
				<p>Cardon nodded, dropping into a chair beside the desk. “Just came from campaign headquarters. This automatic tally system they use on the voting machines is really something. Complete returns tabulated and reported for the whole state within forty minutes after the polls closed. I won’t be silly enough to ask you if you got the returns.”</p>
				<p>“I deserved that, of course,” Lancedale chuckled. “Can I offer you refreshment? A nice big stein of Cardon’s Black Bottle, for instance?”</p>
				<p>Cardon shuddered and grimaced horribly. “I’ve been drinking that slop by the bucketful, all day. And Pelton’s throwing a victory party, tonight, and I’ll have to choke down another half gallon of it. Give me a cup of coffee, and one of those good cigars of yours.”</p>
				<p>Lancedale grinned at him. “Ah, yes, the jolly brewer. His own best advertisement. How’s Pelton reacting to his triumph? And what’s his attitude toward his children? I’ve been worrying about that; vestigial traces of a conscience, I suppose.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I had to keep him steamed up, till after he went off the air,” Cardon said. “Chet isn’t a very good actor. But after that, I talked to him like a Dutch uncle. Told him what a swell pair of kids and a fine son-in-law he had. He got sore at me. Tried to throw me out of the house, a couple of times. I was afraid he was going to have another of those attacks. But by the time Ralph and Claire get back from their honeymoon and Ray finishes that cram-course for Literate prep school, he’ll be ready to confer the paternal blessing all around. I’m going to stay in town and make sure of it, and then I’m taking about a month’s vacation.”</p>
				<p>“You’ve earned it, all right.” Lancedale poured Cardon’s coffee and passed him the cigar humidor. “How’s Pelton’s attitude toward the Consolidated Illiterates’ Organization, now?”</p>
				<p>Cardon, having picked up the Italian stiletto to puncture his cigar, looked at it carefully to make sure that it really had no edge, and then drew it quickly across his throat.</p>
				<p>“Just like that. You know what really happened, yesterday afternoon, at the store, don’t you?”</p>
				<p>“Well, in general, yes. I wish you’d fill me in on some of the details, though, Frank.”</p>
				<p>“Details he wants. Well.” Cardon blew on his coffee and sipped it. “The way we played it for propaganda purposes, of course, there was only one big riot, and it was all the work of the wicked Literates and their Independent-Conservative hirelings. Actually, there were two riots. First, there was one the Independents had planned for about a week in advance; that was the one Sforza tipped us on, the one that started in China. Graves knew about it, enough to advise Latterman to get all the Literates out of the store before noon, which Latterman did, with trimmings.</p>
				<p>“Then, there was another riot, masterminded by a couple of Illiterates’ Organization Action Committee people named Joe West and Horace Yingling, both deceased. That was the result of Latterman’s bright idea to trap Claire and/or me into betraying Literacy. These Illiterate fanatics made up their minds, to speak rather loosely, that the whole Pelton family were Literates, including Chet himself. They decided that it was better to kill off their candidate and use him for a martyr two years from now than to elect him and have him sell them out. They got about a hundred or so of their goons dressed in Independent-Conservative <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.K.K.</abbr> costumes, bought air support from Patsy Callazo’s mob, up in Vermont, and made that attack on the top landing stage, after starting a fake riot in North Jersey, to draw off the regular Radical-Socialist storm troops. Incidentally, when I found out it was Callazo’s gang that furnished those fighter bombers, I hired another mob to go up and drop a blockbuster on Callazo’s field, to teach him to keep his schnozzle out of politics.”</p>
				<p>Lancedale nodded briskly. “That I approve of. How about West and Yingling?”</p>
				<p>“Prestonby’s muscle man, Yetsko, killed West. I took care of Comrade Yingling, myself, after I’d gotten reinforcements to the store⁠—first a couple of freelance storm troops that the insurance company hired, and then as many of the Radical Rangers as I could gather up.”</p>
				<p>“And Pelton knows about all this?”</p>
				<p>“He certainly does! After this caper, the Illiterates’ Organization’s through, as far as any consideration or patronage from the Radicals is concerned.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s pretty nearly the best thing I’ve heard out of the whole business,” Lancedale said. “In about eight or ten years, we may want to pull the Independent-Conservative party together again, to cash in on public dissatisfaction with Pelton’s socialized Literacy program, which ought to be coming apart at the seams by then. And if we have the Illiterates split into two hostile factions⁠—”</p>
				<p>Cardon finished his coffee. “Well, chief, I’ve got to be getting along. O’Reilly can only cover me for a short while, and I have to be getting to this victory party of Pelton’s⁠—”</p>
				<p>Lancedale rose and shook hands with him. “I can’t tell you, too many times, what a fine job you did, Frank,” he said. “I hope⁠ ⁠… no, knowing you, I’m positive⁠ ⁠… that you’ll be able to engineer a reconciliation between Pelton and his son and daughter and young Prestonby. And then, have yourself a good vacation.”</p>
				<p>“I mean to. I’m going deer hunting, to a place up in the mountains, along the old Pennsylvania-New York state line. A little community of about a thousand people, where everybody, men, women and children, can read.”</p>
				<p>Lancedale was interested. “A community of Literates?”</p>
				<p>Cardon shook his head. “Not Literates-with-a-big-L; just people who can read and write,” he replied. “It’s a kind of back-eddy sort of place, and I imagine, a couple of hundred years ago, the community was too poor to support one of these ‘progressive’ school systems that made Illiterates out of the people in the cities. Probably couldn’t raise enough money in school taxes to buy all the expensive audiovisual equipment, so they had to use old-fashioned textbooks, and teach the children to read from them. They have radios, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">TV</abbr>, of course, but they also have a little daily paper, and they have a community library.”</p>
				<p>Lancedale was thoughtful, for a moment. “You know, Frank, there must be quite a few little enclaves of lowercase-literacy like that, in backwoods and mountain communities, especially in the west and the south. I’m going to make a project of finding such communities, helping them, and getting recruits from them. They’ll fit into the Plan. Well, I’ll be seeing you some time tomorrow, I suppose?”</p>
				<p>He watched Cardon go out, and then poured a glass of port for himself and sipped slowly, holding the glass to the light and watching the ruby glow it cast on the desk top. It had been over thirty years ago, when he had been old Jules de Chambord’s assistant, that the Plan had been first conceived. De Chambord was dead these twenty years, and he had taken the old man’s place, and they had only made the first step. Things would move faster, now, but he would still die before the Plan was completed, and Frank Cardon, whom he had marked as his successor, would be an old man, and somebody like young Ray Pelton would be ready to replace him, but the Plan would go on, until everybody would be literate, not Literate, and illiteracy, not Illiteracy, would be a mark of social stigma, and most people would live their whole lives without personal acquaintance with an illiterate.</p>
				<p>There were a few years, yet, to prepare for the next step. The white smocks would have to go; Literates would have to sacrifice their paltry titles and distinctions. There would have to be a reconstitution of the Fraternities. Wilton Joyner and Harvey Graves and the other Conservative Literates would have to be convinced, emotionally as well as intellectually, of the need for change. There were a few of the older brothers who could never adjust their thinking; they would have to be promoted to positions with higher salaries and more impressive titles and no authority whatever.</p>
				<p>But that was all a matter of tactics; the younger men, like Frank Cardon and Elliot Mongery and Ralph Prestonby, could take care of that. Certain changes would occur: A stable and peaceful order of society, for one thing. A rule of law, and the liquidation of these goon gangs and storm troops and private armies. If a beginning at that were made tomorrow, using the battle at Pelton’s store to mobilize public opinion, it would still take two decades to get anything really significant done. And a renaissance of technological and scientific progress⁠—Today, the manufacturers changed the ’copter models twice a year⁠—and, except for altering the shape of a few chromium-plated excrescences or changing the contours slightly, they were the same ’copters that had been buzzing over the country at the time of the Third World War. Every month, the pharmaceutical companies announced a new wonder drug⁠—and if it wasn’t sulfa, it was penicillin, and if it wasn’t penicillin it would be aureomycin. Why, most of the scientific research was being carried on by a few Literates in the basements of a few libraries, rediscovering the science of two centuries ago.</p>
				<p>He sighed, and finished his port, and, as he did probably once every six months, he refilled the glass. He’d be seventy-two next birthday. Maybe he’d live long enough to see⁠—</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Omnilingual</h2>
			<p>Martha Dane paused, looking up at the purple-tinged copper sky. The wind had shifted since noon, while she had been inside, and the dust storm that was sweeping the high deserts to the east was now blowing out over Syrtis. The sun, magnified by the haze, was a gorgeous magenta ball, as large as the sun of Terra, at which she could look directly. Tonight, some of that dust would come sifting down from the upper atmosphere to add another film to what had been burying the city for the last fifty thousand years.</p>
			<p>The red loess lay over everything, covering the streets and the open spaces of park and plaza, hiding the small houses that had been crushed and pressed flat under it and the rubble that had come down from the tall buildings when roofs had caved in and walls had toppled outward. Here, where she stood, the ancient streets were a hundred to a hundred and fifty feet below the surface; the breach they had made in the wall of the building behind her had opened into the sixth story. She could look down on the cluster of prefabricated huts and sheds, on the brush-grown flat that had been the waterfront when this place had been a seaport on the ocean that was now Syrtis Depression; already, the bright metal was thinly coated with red dust. She thought, again, of what clearing this city would mean, in terms of time and labor, of people and supplies and equipment brought across fifty million miles of space. They’d have to use machinery; there was no other way it could be done. Bulldozers and power shovels and draglines; they were fast, but they were rough and indiscriminate. She remembered the digs around Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, in the Indus Valley, and the careful, patient native laborers⁠—the painstaking foremen, the pickmen and spademen, the long files of basketmen carrying away the earth. Slow and primitive as the civilization whose ruins they were uncovering, yes, but she could count on the fingers of one hand the times one of her pickmen had damaged a valuable object in the ground. If it hadn’t been for the underpaid and uncomplaining native laborer, archaeology would still be back where Wincklemann had found it. But on Mars there was no native labor; the last Martian had died five hundred centuries ago.</p>
			<p>Something started banging like a machine gun, four or five hundred yards to her left. A solenoid jackhammer; Tony Lattimer must have decided which building he wanted to break into next. She became conscious, then, of the awkward weight of her equipment, and began redistributing it, shifting the straps of her oxy-tank pack, slinging the camera from one shoulder and the board and drafting tools from the other, gathering the notebooks and sketchbooks under her left arm. She started walking down the road, over hillocks of buried rubble, around snags of wall jutting up out of the loess, past buildings still standing, some of them already breached and explored, and across the brush-grown flat to the huts.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were ten people in the main office room of Hut One when she entered. As soon as she had disposed of her oxygen equipment, she lit a cigarette, her first since noon, then looked from one to another of them. Old Selim von Ohlmhorst, the Turco-German, one of her two fellow archaeologists, sitting at the end of the long table against the farther wall, smoking his big curved pipe and going through a looseleaf notebook. The girl ordnance officer, Sachiko Koremitsu, between two droplights at the other end of the table, her head bent over her work. Colonel Hubert Penrose, the Space Force <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.O.</abbr>, and Captain Field, the intelligence officer, listening to the report of one of the airdyne pilots, returned from his afternoon survey flight. A couple of girl lieutenants from Signals, going over the script of the evening telecast, to be transmitted to the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Cyrano</i>, on orbit five thousand miles off planet and relayed from thence to Terra via Lunar. Sid Chamberlain, the Trans-Space News Service man, was with them. Like Selim and herself, he was a civilian; he was advertising the fact with a white shirt and a sleeveless blue sweater. And Major Lindemann, the engineer officer, and one of his assistants, arguing over some plans on a drafting board. She hoped, drawing a pint of hot water to wash her hands and sponge off her face, that they were doing something about the pipeline.</p>
			<p>She started to carry the notebooks and sketchbooks over to where Selim von Ohlmhorst was sitting, and then, as she always did, she turned aside and stopped to watch Sachiko. The Japanese girl was restoring what had been a book, fifty thousand years ago; her eyes were masked by a binocular loup, the black headband invisible against her glossy black hair, and she was picking delicately at the crumbled page with a hair-fine wire set in a handle of copper tubing. Finally, loosening a particle as tiny as a snowflake, she grasped it with tweezers, placed it on the sheet of transparent plastic on which she was reconstructing the page, and set it with a mist of fixative from a little spraygun. It was a sheer joy to watch her; every movement was as graceful and precise as though done to music after being rehearsed a hundred times.</p>
			<p>“Hello, Martha. It isn’t cocktail-time yet, is it?” The girl at the table spoke without raising her head, almost without moving her lips, as though she were afraid that the slightest breath would disturb the flaky stuff in front of her.</p>
			<p>“No, it’s only fifteen-thirty. I finished my work, over there. I didn’t find any more books, if that’s good news for you.”</p>
			<p>Sachiko took off the loup and leaned back in her chair, her palms cupped over her eyes.</p>
			<p>“No, I like doing this. I call it micro-jigsaw puzzles. This book, here, really is a mess. Selim found it lying open, with some heavy stuff on top of it; the pages were simply crushed.” She hesitated briefly. “If only it would mean something, after I did it.”</p>
			<p>There could be a faintly critical overtone to that. As she replied, Martha realized that she was being defensive.</p>
			<p>“It will, some day. Look how long it took to read Egyptian hieroglyphics, even after they had the Rosetta Stone.”</p>
			<p>Sachiko smiled. “Yes. I know. But they did have the Rosetta Stone.”</p>
			<p>“And we don’t. There is no Rosetta Stone, not anywhere on Mars.” A whole race, a whole species, died while the first Crò-Magnon cave-artist was daubing pictures of reindeer and bison, and across fifty thousand years and fifty million miles there was no bridge of understanding.</p>
			<p>“We’ll find one. There must be something, somewhere, that will give us the meaning of a few words, and we’ll use them to pry meaning out of more words, and so on. We may not live to learn this language, but we’ll make a start, and some day somebody will.”</p>
			<p>Sachiko took her hands from her eyes, being careful not to look toward the unshaded light, and smiled again. This time Martha was sure that it was not the Japanese smile of politeness, but the universally human smile of friendship.</p>
			<p>“I hope so, Martha: really I do. It would be wonderful for you to be the first to do it, and it would be wonderful for all of us to be able to read what these people wrote. It would really bring this dead city to life again.” The smile faded slowly. “But it seems so hopeless.”</p>
			<p>“You haven’t found any more pictures?”</p>
			<p>Sachiko shook her head. Not that it would have meant much if she had. They had found hundreds of pictures with captions; they had never been able to establish a positive relationship between any pictured object and any printed word. Neither of them said anything more, and after a moment Sachiko replaced the loup and bent her head forward over the book.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Selim von Ohlmhorst looked up from his notebook, taking his pipe out of his mouth.</p>
			<p>“Everything finished, over there?” he asked, releasing a puff of smoke.</p>
			<p>“Such as it was.” She laid the notebooks and sketches on the table. “Captain Gicquel’s started airsealing the building from the fifth floor down, with an entrance on the sixth; he’ll start putting in oxygen generators as soon as that’s done. I have everything cleared up where he’ll be working.”</p>
			<p>Colonel Penrose looked up quickly, as though making a mental note to attend to something later. Then he returned his attention to the pilot, who was pointing something out on a map.</p>
			<p>Von Ohlmhorst nodded. “There wasn’t much to it, at that,” he agreed. “Do you know which building Tony has decided to enter next?”</p>
			<p>“The tall one with the conical thing like a candle extinguisher on top, I think. I heard him drilling for the blasting shots over that way.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I hope it turns out to be one that was occupied up to the end.”</p>
			<p>The last one hadn’t. It had been stripped of its contents and fittings, a piece of this and a bit of that, haphazardly, apparently over a long period of time, until it had been almost gutted. For centuries, as it had died, this city had been consuming itself by a process of auto-cannibalism. She said something to that effect.</p>
			<p>“Yes. We always find that⁠—except, of course, at places like Pompeii. Have you seen any of the other Roman cities in Italy?” he asked. “Minturnae, for instance? First the inhabitants tore down this to repair that, and then, after they had vacated the city, other people came along and tore down what was left, and burned the stones for lime, or crushed them to mend roads, till there was nothing left but the foundation traces. That’s where we are fortunate; this is one of the places where the Martian race perished, and there were no barbarians to come later and destroy what they had left.” He puffed slowly at his pipe. “Some of these days, Martha, we are going to break into one of these buildings and find that it was one in which the last of these people died. Then we will learn the story of the end of this civilization.”</p>
			<p>And if we learn to read their language, we’ll learn the whole story, not just the obituary. She hesitated, not putting the thought into words. “We’ll find that, sometime, Selim,” she said, then looked at her watch. “I’m going to get some more work done on my lists, before dinner.”</p>
			<p>For an instant, the old man’s face stiffened in disapproval; he started to say something, thought better of it, and put his pipe back into his mouth. The brief wrinkling around his mouth and the twitch of his white mustache had been enough, however; she knew what he was thinking. She was wasting time and effort, he believed; time and effort belonging not to herself but to the expedition. He could be right, too, she realized. But he had to be wrong; there had to be a way to do it. She turned from him silently and went to her own packing-case seat, at the middle of the table.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Photographs, and photostats of restored pages of books, and transcripts of inscriptions, were piled in front of her, and the notebooks in which she was compiling her lists. She sat down, lighting a fresh cigarette, and reached over to a stack of unexamined material, taking off the top sheet. It was a photostat of what looked like the title page and contents of some sort of a periodical. She remembered it; she had found it herself, two days before, in a closet in the basement of the building she had just finished examining.</p>
			<p>She sat for a moment, looking at it. It was readable, in the sense that she had set up a purely arbitrary but consistently pronounceable system of phonetic values for the letters. The long vertical symbols were vowels. There were only ten of them; not too many, allowing separate characters for long and short sounds. There were twenty of the short horizontal letters, which meant that sounds like <i epub:type="z3998:phoneme">-ng</i> or <i epub:type="z3998:phoneme">-ch</i> or <i epub:type="z3998:phoneme">-sh</i> were single letters. The odds were millions to one against her system being anything like the original sound of the language, but she had listed several thousand Martian words, and she could pronounce all of them.</p>
			<p>And that was as far as it went. She could pronounce between three and four thousand Martian words, and she couldn’t assign a meaning to one of them. Selim von Ohlmhorst believed that she never would. So did Tony Lattimer, and he was a great deal less reticent about saying so. So, she was sure, did Sachiko Koremitsu. There were times, now and then, when she began to be afraid that they were right.</p>
			<p>The letters on the page in front of her began squirming and dancing, slender vowels with fat little consonants. They did that, now, every night in her dreams. And there were other dreams, in which she read them as easily as English; waking, she would try desperately and vainly to remember. She blinked, and looked away from the photostatted page; when she looked back, the letters were behaving themselves again. There were three words at the top of the page, over-and-underlined, which seemed to be the Martian method of capitalization. <i xml:lang="x-martian">Mastharnorvod Tadavas Sornhulva.</i> She pronounced them mentally, leafing through her notebooks to see if she had encountered them before, and in what contexts. All three were listed. In addition, <i xml:lang="x-martian">masthar</i> was a fairly common word, and so was <i xml:lang="x-martian">norvod</i>, and so was <i xml:lang="x-martian">nor</i>, but <i xml:lang="x-martian">-vod</i> was a suffix and nothing but a suffix. <i xml:lang="x-martian">Davas</i>, was a word, too, and <i xml:lang="x-martian">ta-</i> was a common prefix; <i xml:lang="x-martian">sorn</i> and <i xml:lang="x-martian">hulva</i> were both common words. This language, she had long ago decided, must be something like German; when the Martians had needed a new word, they had just pasted a couple of existing words together. It would probably turn out to be a grammatical horror. Well, they had published magazines, and one of them had been called <i xml:lang="x-martian">Mastharnorvod Tadavas Sornhulva.</i> She wondered if it had been something like the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.journal">Quarterly Archaeological Review</i>, or something more on the order of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Sexy Stories</i>.</p>
			<p>A smaller line, under the title, was plainly the issue number and date; enough things had been found numbered in series to enable her to identify the numerals and determine that a decimal system of numeration had been used. This was the one thousand and seven hundred and fifty-fourth issue, for <i xml:lang="x-martian">Doma</i>, 14837; then <i xml:lang="x-martian">Doma</i> must be the name of one of the Martian months. The word had turned up several times before. She found herself puffing furiously on her cigarette as she leafed through notebooks and piles of already examined material.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Sachiko was speaking to somebody, and a chair scraped at the end of the table. She raised her head, to see a big man with red hair and a red face, in Space Force green, with the single star of a major on his shoulder, sitting down. Ivan Fitzgerald, the medic. He was lifting weights from a book similar to the one the girl ordnance officer was restoring.</p>
			<p>“Haven’t had time, lately,” he was saying, in reply to Sachiko’s question. “The Finchley girl’s still down with whatever it is she has, and it’s something I haven’t been able to diagnose yet. And I’ve been checking on bacteria cultures, and in what spare time I have, I’ve been dissecting specimens for Bill Chandler. Bill’s finally found a mammal. Looks like a lizard, and it’s only four inches long, but it’s a real warm-blooded, gamogenetic, placental, viviparous mammal. Burrows, and seems to live on what pass for insects here.”</p>
			<p>“Is there enough oxygen for anything like that?” Sachiko was asking.</p>
			<p>“Seems to be, close to the ground.” Fitzgerald got the headband of his loup adjusted, and pulled it down over his eyes. “He found this thing in a ravine down on the sea bottom⁠—Ha, this page seems to be intact; now, if I can get it out all in one piece⁠—”</p>
			<p>He went on talking inaudibly to himself, lifting the page a little at a time and sliding one of the transparent plastic sheets under it, working with minute delicacy. Not the delicacy of the Japanese girl’s small hands, moving like the paws of a cat washing her face, but like a steam-hammer cracking a peanut. Field archaeology requires a certain delicacy of touch, too, but Martha watched the pair of them with envious admiration. Then she turned back to her own work, finishing the table of contents.</p>
			<p>The next page was the beginning of the first article listed; many of the words were unfamiliar. She had the impression that this must be some kind of scientific or technical journal; that could be because such publications made up the bulk of her own periodical reading. She doubted if it were fiction; the paragraphs had a solid, factual look.</p>
			<p>At length, Ivan Fitzgerald gave a short, explosive grunt.</p>
			<p>“Ha! Got it!”</p>
			<p>She looked up. He had detached the page and was cementing another plastic sheet onto it.</p>
			<p>“Any pictures?” she asked.</p>
			<p>“None on this side. Wait a moment.” He turned the sheet. “None on this side, either.” He sprayed another sheet of plastic to sandwich the page, then picked up his pipe and relighted it.</p>
			<p>“I get fun out of this, and it’s good practice for my hands, so don’t think I’m complaining,” he said, “but, Martha, do you honestly think anybody’s ever going to get anything out of this?”</p>
			<p>Sachiko held up a scrap of the silicone plastic the Martians had used for paper with her tweezers. It was almost an inch square.</p>
			<p>“Look; three whole words on this piece,” she crowed. “Ivan, you took the easy book.”</p>
			<p>Fitzgerald wasn’t being sidetracked. “This stuff’s absolutely meaningless,” he continued. “It had a meaning fifty thousand years ago, when it was written, but it has none at all now.”</p>
			<p>She shook her head. “Meaning isn’t something that evaporates with time,” she argued. “It has just as much meaning now as it ever had. We just haven’t learned how to decipher it.”</p>
			<p>“That seems like a pretty pointless distinction,” Selim von Ohlmhorst joined the conversation. “There no longer exists a means of deciphering it.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll find one.” She was speaking, she realized, more in self-encouragement than in controversy.</p>
			<p>“How? From pictures and captions? We’ve found captioned pictures, and what have they given us? A caption is intended to explain the picture, not the picture to explain the caption. Suppose some alien to our culture found a picture of a man with a white beard and mustache sawing a billet from a log. He would think the caption meant, ‘Man Sawing Wood.’ How would he know that it was really ‘Wilhelm <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> in Exile at Doorn?’ ”</p>
			<p>Sachiko had taken off her loup and was lighting a cigarette.</p>
			<p>“I can think of pictures intended to explain their captions,” she said. “These picture language-books, the sort we use in the Service⁠—little line drawings, with a word or phrase under them.”</p>
			<p>“Well, of course, if we found something like that,” von Ohlmhorst began.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Michael Ventris found something like that, back in the Fifties,” Hubert Penrose’s voice broke in from directly behind her.</p>
			<p>She turned her head. The colonel was standing by the archaeologists’ table; Captain Field and the airdyne pilot had gone out.</p>
			<p>“He found a lot of Greek inventories of military stores,” Penrose continued. “They were in Cretan Linear B script, and at the head of each list was a little picture, a sword or a helmet or a cooking tripod or a chariot wheel. That’s what gave him the key to the script.”</p>
			<p>“Colonel’s getting to be quite an archaeologist,” Fitzgerald commented. “We’re all learning each others’ specialties, on this expedition.”</p>
			<p>“I heard about that long before this expedition was even contemplated.” Penrose was tapping a cigarette on his gold case. “I heard about that back before the Thirty Days’ War, at Intelligence School, when I was a lieutenant. As a feat of cryptanalysis, not an archaeological discovery.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, cryptanalysis,” von Ohlmhorst pounced. “The reading of a known language in an unknown form of writing. Ventris’ lists were in the known language, Greek. Neither he nor anybody else ever read a word of the Cretan language until the finding of the Greek-Cretan bilingual in 1963, because only with a bilingual text, one language already known, can an unknown ancient language be learned. And what hope, I ask you, have we of finding anything like that here? Martha, you’ve been working on these Martian texts ever since we landed here⁠—for the last six months. Tell me, have you found a single word to which you can positively assign a meaning?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I think I have one.” She was trying hard not to sound too exultant. “<i xml:lang="x-martian">Doma.</i> It’s the name of one of the months of the Martian calendar.”</p>
			<p>“Where did you find that?” von Ohlmhorst asked. “And how did you establish⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“Here.” She picked up the photostat and handed it along the table to him. “I’d call this the title page of a magazine.”</p>
			<p>He was silent for a moment, looking at it. “Yes. I would say so, too. Have you any of the rest of it?”</p>
			<p>“I’m working on the first page of the first article, listed there. Wait till I see; yes, here’s all I found, together, here.” She told him where she had gotten it. “I just gathered it up, at the time, and gave it to Geoffrey and Rosita to photostat; this is the first I’ve really examined it.”</p>
			<p>The old man got to his feet, brushing tobacco ashes from the front of his jacket, and came to where she was sitting, laying the title page on the table and leafing quickly through the stack of photostats.</p>
			<p>“Yes, and here is the second article, on page eight, and here’s the next one.” He finished the pile of photostats. “A couple of pages missing at the end of the last article. This is remarkable; surprising that a thing like a magazine would have survived so long.”</p>
			<p>“Well, this silicone stuff the Martians used for paper is pretty durable,” Hubert Penrose said. “There doesn’t seem to have been any water or any other fluid in it originally, so it wouldn’t dry out with time.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, it’s not remarkable that the material would have survived. We’ve found a good many books and papers in excellent condition. But only a really vital culture, an organized culture, will publish magazines, and this civilization had been dying for hundreds of years before the end. It might have been a thousand years before the time they died out completely that such activities as publishing ended.”</p>
			<p>“Well, look where I found it; in a closet in a cellar. Tossed in there and forgotten, and then ignored when they were stripping the building. Things like that happen.”</p>
			<p>Penrose had picked up the title page and was looking at it.</p>
			<p>“I don’t think there’s any doubt about this being a magazine, at all.” He looked again at the title, his lips moving silently. “<i xml:lang="x-martian">Mastharnorvod Tadavas Sornhulva.</i> Wonder what it means. But you’re right about the date⁠—<i xml:lang="x-martian">Doma</i> seems to be the name of a month. Yes, you have a word, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dane.”</p>
			<p>Sid Chamberlain, seeing that something unusual was going on, had come over from the table at which he was working. After examining the title page and some of the inside pages, he began whispering into the stenophone he had taken from his belt.</p>
			<p>“Don’t try to blow this up to anything big, Sid,” she cautioned. “All we have is the name of a month, and Lord only knows how long it’ll be till we even find out which month it was.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it’s a start, isn’t it?” Penrose argued. “Grotefend only had the word for ‘king’ when he started reading Persian cuneiform.”</p>
			<p>“But I don’t have the word for month; just the name of a month. Everybody knew the names of the Persian kings, long before Grotefend.”</p>
			<p>“That’s not the story,” Chamberlain said. “What the public back on Terra will be interested in is finding out that the Martians published magazines, just like we do. Something familiar; make the Martians seem more real. More human.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Three men had come in, and were removing their masks and helmets and oxy-tanks, and peeling out of their quilted coveralls. Two were Space Force lieutenants; the third was a youngish civilian with close-cropped blond hair, in a checked woolen shirt. Tony Lattimer and his helpers.</p>
			<p>“Don’t tell me Martha finally got something out of that stuff?” he asked, approaching the table. He might have been commenting on the antics of the village half-wit, from his tone.</p>
			<p>“Yes; the name of one of the Martian months.” Hubert Penrose went on to explain, showing the photostat.</p>
			<p>Tony Lattimer took it, glanced at it, and dropped it on the table.</p>
			<p>“Sounds plausible, of course, but just an assumption. That word may not be the name of a month, at all⁠—could mean ‘published’ or ‘authorized’ or ‘copyrighted’ or anything like that. Fact is, I don’t think it’s more than a wild guess that that thing’s anything like a periodical.” He dismissed the subject and turned to Penrose. “I picked out the next building to enter; that tall one with the conical thing on top. It ought to be in pretty good shape inside; the conical top wouldn’t allow dust to accumulate, and from the outside nothing seems to be caved in or crushed. Ground level’s higher than the other one, about the seventh floor. I found a good place and drilled for the shots; tomorrow I’ll blast a hole in it, and if you can spare some people to help, we can start exploring it right away.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lattimer. I can spare about a dozen, and I suppose you can find a few civilian volunteers,” Penrose told him. “What will you need in the way of equipment?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, about six demolition-packets; they can all be shot together. And the usual thing in the way of lights, and breaking and digging tools, and climbing equipment in case we run into broken or doubtful stairways. We’ll divide into two parties. Nothing ought to be entered for the first time without a qualified archaeologist along. Three parties, if Martha can tear herself away from this catalogue of systematized incomprehensibilities she’s making long enough to do some real work.”</p>
			<p>She felt her chest tighten and her face become stiff. She was pressing her lips together to lock in a furious retort when Hubert Penrose answered for her.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dane’s been doing as much work, and as important work, as you have,” he said brusquely. “More important work, I’d be inclined to say.”</p>
			<p>Von Ohlmhorst was visibly distressed; he glanced once toward Sid Chamberlain, then looked hastily away from him. Afraid of a story of dissension among archaeologists getting out.</p>
			<p>“Working out a system of pronunciation by which the Martian language could be transliterated was a most important contribution,” he said. “And Martha did that almost unassisted.”</p>
			<p>“Unassisted by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lattimer, anyway,” Penrose added. “Captain Field and Lieutenant Koremitsu did some work, and I helped out a little, but nine-tenths of it she did herself.”</p>
			<p>“Purely arbitrary,” Lattimer disdained. “Why, we don’t even know that the Martians could make the same kind of vocal sounds we do.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes, we do,” Ivan Fitzgerald contradicted, safe on his own ground. “I haven’t seen any actual Martian skulls⁠—these people seem to have been very tidy about disposing of their dead⁠—but from statues and busts and pictures I’ve seen. I’d say that their vocal organs were identical with our own.”</p>
			<p>“Well, grant that. And grant that it’s going to be impressive to rattle off the names of Martian notables whose statues we find, and that if we’re ever able to attribute any placenames, they’ll sound a lot better than this horse-doctors’ Latin the old astronomers splashed all over the map of Mars,” Lattimer said. “What I object to is her wasting time on this stuff, of which nobody will ever be able to read a word if she fiddles around with those lists till there’s another hundred feet of loess on this city, when there’s so much real work to be done and we’re as shorthanded as we are.”</p>
			<p>That was the first time that had come out in just so many words. She was glad Lattimer had said it and not Selim von Ohlmhorst.</p>
			<p>“What you mean,” she retorted, “is that it doesn’t have the publicity value that digging up statues has.”</p>
			<p>For an instant, she could see that the shot had scored. Then Lattimer, with a side glance at Chamberlain, answered:</p>
			<p>“What I mean is that you’re trying to find something that any archaeologist, yourself included, should know doesn’t exist. I don’t object to your gambling your professional reputation and making a laughing stock of yourself; what I object to is that the blunders of one archaeologist discredit the whole subject in the eyes of the public.”</p>
			<p>That seemed to be what worried Lattimer most. She was framing a reply when the communication-outlet whistled shrilly, and then squawked: “Cocktail time! One hour to dinner; cocktails in the library, Hut Four!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The library, which was also lounge, recreation room, and general gathering-place, was already crowded; most of the crowd was at the long table topped with sheets of glasslike plastic that had been wall panels out of one of the ruined buildings. She poured herself what passed, here, for a martini, and carried it over to where Selim von Ohlmhorst was sitting alone.</p>
			<p>For a while, they talked about the building they had just finished exploring, then drifted into reminiscences of their work on Terra⁠—von Ohlmhorst’s in Asia Minor, with the Hittite Empire, and hers in Pakistan, excavating the cities of the Harappa Civilization. They finished their drinks⁠—the ingredients were plentiful; alcohol and flavoring extracts synthesized from Martian vegetation⁠—and von Ohlmhorst took the two glasses to the table for refills.</p>
			<p>“You know, Martha,” he said, when he returned, “Tony was right about one thing. You are gambling your professional standing and reputation. It’s against all archaeological experience that a language so completely dead as this one could be deciphered. There was a continuity between all the other ancient languages⁠—by knowing Greek, Champollion learned to read Egyptian; by knowing Egyptian, Hittite was learned. That’s why you and your colleagues have never been able to translate the Harappa hieroglyphics; no such continuity exists there. If you insist that this utterly dead language can be read, your reputation will suffer for it.”</p>
			<p>“I heard Colonel Penrose say, once, that an officer who’s afraid to risk his military reputation seldom makes much of a reputation. It’s the same with us. If we really want to find things out, we have to risk making mistakes. And I’m a lot more interested in finding things out than I am in my reputation.”</p>
			<p>She glanced across the room, to where Tony Lattimer was sitting with Gloria Standish, talking earnestly, while Gloria sipped one of the counterfeit martinis and listened. Gloria was the leading contender for the title of Miss Mars, 1996, if you liked big bosomy blondes, but Tony would have been just as attentive to her if she’d looked like the Wicked Witch in “The Wizard of Oz,” because Gloria was the Pan-Federation Telecast System commentator with the expedition.</p>
			<p>“I know you are,” the old Turco-German was saying. “That’s why, when they asked me to name another archaeologist for this expedition, I named you.”</p>
			<p>He hadn’t named Tony Lattimer; Lattimer had been pushed onto the expedition by his university. There’d been a lot of high-level string-pulling to that; she wished she knew the whole story. She’d managed to keep clear of universities and university politics; all her digs had been sponsored by non-academic foundations or art museums.</p>
			<p>“You have an excellent standing: much better than my own, at your age. That’s why it disturbs me to see you jeopardizing it by this insistence that the Martian language can be translated. I can’t, really, see how you can hope to succeed.”</p>
			<p>She shrugged and drank some more of her cocktail, then lit another cigarette. It was getting tiresome to try to verbalize something she only felt.</p>
			<p>“Neither do I, now, but I will. Maybe I’ll find something like the picture-books Sachiko was talking about. A child’s primer, maybe; surely they had things like that. And if I don’t. I’ll find something else. We’ve only been here six months. I can wait the rest of my life, if I have to, but I’ll do it sometime.”</p>
			<p>“I can’t wait so long,” von Ohlmhorst said. “The rest of my life will only be a few years, and when the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Schiaparelli</i> orbits in, I’ll be going back to Terra on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Cyrano</i>.”</p>
			<p>“I wish you wouldn’t. This is a whole new world of archaeology. Literally.”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” He finished the cocktail and looked at his pipe as though wondering whether to relight it so soon before dinner, then put it in his pocket. “A whole new world⁠—but I’ve grown old, and it isn’t for me. I’ve spent my life studying the Hittites. I can speak the Hittite language, though maybe King Muwatallis wouldn’t be able to understand my modern Turkish accent. But the things I’d have to learn here⁠—chemistry, physics, engineering, how to run analytic tests on steel girders and beryllo-silver alloys and plastics and silicones. I’m more at home with a civilization that rode in chariots and fought with swords and was just learning how to work iron. Mars is for young people. This expedition is a cadre of leadership⁠—not only the Space Force people, who’ll be the commanders of the main expedition, but us scientists, too. And I’m just an old cavalry general who can’t learn to command tanks and aircraft. You’ll have time to learn about Mars. I won’t.”</p>
			<p>His reputation as the dean of Hittitologists was solid and secure, too, she added mentally. Then she felt ashamed of the thought. He wasn’t to be classed with Tony Lattimer.</p>
			<p>“All I came for was to get the work started,” he was continuing. “The Federation Government felt that an old hand should do that. Well, it’s started, now; you and Tony and whoever come out on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Schiaparelli</i> must carry it on. You said it, yourself; you have a whole new world. This is only one city, of the last Martian civilization. Behind this, you have the Late Upland Culture, and the Canal Builders, and all the civilizations and races and empires before them, clear back to the Martian Stone Age.” He hesitated for a moment. “You have no idea what all you have to learn, Martha. This isn’t the time to start specializing too narrowly.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They all got out of the truck and stretched their legs and looked up the road to the tall building with the queer conical cap askew on its top. The four little figures that had been busy against its wall climbed into the jeep and started back slowly, the smallest of them, Sachiko Koremitsu, paying out an electric cable behind. When it pulled up beside the truck, they climbed out; Sachiko attached the free end of the cable to a nuclear-electric battery. At once, dirty gray smoke and orange dust puffed out from the wall of the building, and, a second later, the multiple explosion banged.</p>
			<p>She and Tony Lattimer and Major Lindemann climbed onto the truck, leaving the jeep stand by the road. When they reached the building, a satisfyingly wide breach had been blown in the wall. Lattimer had placed his shots between two of the windows; they were both blown out along with the wall between, and lay unbroken on the ground. Martha remembered the first building they had entered. A Space Force officer had picked up a stone and thrown it at one of the windows, thinking that would be all they’d need to do. It had bounced back. He had drawn his pistol⁠—they’d all carried guns, then, on the principle that what they didn’t know about Mars might easily hurt them⁠—and fired four shots. The bullets had ricocheted, screaming thinly; there were four coppery smears of jacket-metal on the window, and a little surface spalling. Somebody tried a rifle; the 4000-<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">f.s.</abbr> bullet had cracked the glasslike pane without penetrating. An oxyacetylene torch had taken an hour to cut the window out; the lab crew, aboard the ship, were still trying to find out just what the stuff was.</p>
			<p>Tony Lattimer had gone forward and was sweeping his flashlight back and forth, swearing petulantly, his voice harshened and amplified by his helmet-speaker.</p>
			<p>“I thought I was blasting into a hallway; this lets us into a room. Careful; there’s about a two-foot drop to the floor, and a lot of rubble from the blast just inside.”</p>
			<p>He stepped down through the breach; the others began dragging equipment out of the trucks⁠—shovels and picks and crowbars and sledges, portable floodlights, cameras, sketching materials, an extension ladder, even Alpinists’ ropes and crampons and pickaxes. Hubert Penrose was shouldering something that looked like a surrealist machine gun but which was really a nuclear-electric jackhammer. Martha selected one of the spike-shod mountaineer’s ice axes, with which she could dig or chop or poke or pry or help herself over rough footing.</p>
			<p>The windows, grimed and crusted with fifty millennia of dust, filtered in a dim twilight; even the breach in the wall, in the morning shade, lighted only a small patch of floor. Somebody snapped on a floodlight, aiming it at the ceiling. The big room was empty and bare; dust lay thick on the floor and reddened the once-white walls. It could have been a large office, but there was nothing left in it to indicate its use.</p>
			<p>“This one’s been stripped up to the seventh floor!” Lattimer exclaimed. “Street level’ll be cleaned out, completely.”</p>
			<p>“Do for living quarters and shops, then,” Lindemann said. “Added to the others, this’ll take care of everybody on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Schiaparelli</i>.”</p>
			<p>“Seem to have been a lot of electric or electronic apparatus over along this wall,” one of the Space Force officers commented. “Ten or twelve electric outlets.” He brushed the dusty wall with his glove, then scraped on the floor with his foot. “I can see where things were pried loose.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The door, one of the double sliding things the Martians had used, was closed. Selim von Ohlmhorst tried it, but it was stuck fast. The metal latch-parts had frozen together, molecule bonding itself to molecule, since the door had last been closed. Hubert Penrose came over with the jackhammer, fitting a spear-point chisel into place. He set the chisel in the joint between the doors, braced the hammer against his hip, and squeezed the trigger-switch. The hammer banged briefly like the weapon it resembled, and the doors popped a few inches apart, then stuck. Enough dust had worked into the recesses into which it was supposed to slide to block it on both sides.</p>
			<p>That was old stuff; they ran into that every time they had to force a door, and they were prepared for it. Somebody went outside and brought in a power-jack and finally one of the doors inched back to the door jamb. That was enough to get the lights and equipment through: they all passed from the room to the hallway beyond. About half the other doors were open; each had a number and a single word, <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i>, over it.</p>
			<p>One of the civilian volunteers, a woman professor of natural ecology from Penn State University, was looking up and down the hall.</p>
			<p>“You know,” she said, “I feel at home here. I think this was a college of some sort, and these were classrooms. That word, up there; that was the subject taught, or the department. And those electronic devices, all where the class would face them; audiovisual teaching aids.”</p>
			<p>“A twenty-five-story university?” Lattimer scoffed. “Why, a building like this would handle thirty thousand students.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe there were that many. This was a big city, in its prime,” Martha said, moved chiefly by a desire to oppose Lattimer.</p>
			<p>“Yes, but think of the snafu in the halls, every time they changed classes. It’d take half an hour to get everybody back and forth from one floor to another.” He turned to von Ohlmhorst. “I’m going up above this floor. This place has been looted clean up to here, but there’s a chance there may be something above,” he said.</p>
			<p>“I’ll stay on this floor, at present,” the Turco-German replied. “There will be much coming and going, and dragging things in and out. We should get this completely examined and recorded first. Then Major Lindemann’s people can do their worst, here.”</p>
			<p>“Well, if nobody else wants it, I’ll take the downstairs,” Martha said.</p>
			<p>“I’ll go along with you,” Hubert Penrose told her. “If the lower floors have no archaeological value, we’ll turn them into living quarters. I like this building: it’ll give everybody room to keep out from under everybody else’s feet.” He looked down the hall. “We ought to find escalators at the middle.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The hallway, too, was thick underfoot with dust. Most of the open rooms were empty, but a few contained furniture, including small seat-desks. The original proponent of the university theory pointed these out as just what might be found in classrooms. There were escalators, up and down, on either side of the hall, and more on the intersecting passage to the right.</p>
			<p>“That’s how they handled the students, between classes,” Martha commented. “And I’ll bet there are more ahead, there.”</p>
			<p>They came to a stop where the hallway ended at a great square central hall. There were elevators, there, on two of the sides, and four escalators, still usable as stairways. But it was the walls, and the paintings on them, that brought them up short and staring.</p>
			<p>They were clouded with dirt⁠—she was trying to imagine what they must have looked like originally, and at the same time estimating the labor that would be involved in cleaning them⁠—but they were still distinguishable, as was the word, <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i>, in golden letters above each of the four sides. It was a moment before she realized, from the murals, that she had at last found a meaningful Martian word. They were a vast historical panorama, clockwise around the room. A group of skin-clad savages squatting around a fire. Hunters with bows and spears, carrying a carcass of an animal slightly like a pig. Nomads riding long-legged, graceful mounts like hornless deer. Peasants sowing and reaping; mud-walled hut villages, and cities; processions of priests and warriors; battles with swords and bows, and with cannon and muskets; galleys, and ships with sails, and ships without visible means of propulsion, and aircraft. Changing costumes and weapons and machines and styles of architecture. A richly fertile landscape, gradually merging into barren deserts and bushlands⁠—the time of the great planetwide drought. The Canal Builders⁠—men with machines recognizable as steam-shovels and derricks, digging and quarrying and driving across the empty plains with aqueducts. More cities⁠—seaports on the shrinking oceans; dwindling, half-deserted cities; an abandoned city, with four tiny humanoid figures and a thing like a combat-car in the middle of a brush-grown plaza, they and their vehicle dwarfed by the huge lifeless buildings around them. She had not the least doubt; <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i> was History.</p>
			<p>“Wonderful!” von Ohlmhorst was saying. “The entire history of this race. Why, if the painter depicted appropriate costumes and weapons and machines for each period, and got the architecture right, we can break the history of this planet into eras and periods and civilizations.”</p>
			<p>“You can assume they’re authentic. The faculty of this university would insist on authenticity in the <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i>⁠—History⁠—Department,” she said.</p>
			<p>“Yes! <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i>⁠—History! And your magazine was a journal of <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sornhulva</i>!” Penrose exclaimed. “You have a word, Martha!” It took her an instant to realize that he had called her by her first name, and not <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dane. She wasn’t sure if that weren’t a bigger triumph than learning a word of the Martian language. Or a more auspicious start. “Alone, I suppose that <i xml:lang="x-martian">hulva</i> means something like science or knowledge, or study; combined, it would be equivalent to our ’ology. And <i xml:lang="x-martian">darf</i> would mean something like past, or old times, or human events, or chronicles.”</p>
			<p>“That gives you three words, Martha!” Sachiko jubilated. “You did it.”</p>
			<p>“Let’s don’t go too fast,” Lattimer said, for once not derisively. “I’ll admit that <i xml:lang="x-martian">darfhulva</i> is the Martian word for history as a subject of study; I’ll admit that <i xml:lang="x-martian">hulva</i> is the general word and <i xml:lang="x-martian">darf</i> modifies it and tells us which subject is meant. But as for assigning specific meanings, we can’t do that because we don’t know just how the Martians thought, scientifically or otherwise.”</p>
			<p>He stopped short, startled by the blue-white light that blazed as Sid Chamberlain’s Kliegettes went on. When the whirring of the camera stopped, it was Chamberlain who was speaking:</p>
			<p>“This is the biggest thing yet; the whole history of Mars, stone age to the end, all on four walls. I’m taking this with the fast shutter, but we’ll telecast it in slow motion, from the beginning to the end. Tony, I want you to do the voice for it⁠—running commentary, interpretation of each scene as it’s shown. Would you do that?”</p>
			<p>Would he do that! Martha thought. If he had a tail, he’d be wagging it at the very thought.</p>
			<p>“Well, there ought to be more murals on the other floors,” she said. “Who wants to come downstairs with us?”</p>
			<p>Sachiko did; immediately. Ivan Fitzgerald volunteered. Sid decided to go upstairs with Tony Lattimer, and Gloria Standish decided to go upstairs, too. Most of the party would remain on the seventh floor, to help Selim von Ohlmhorst get it finished. After poking tentatively at the escalator with the spike of her ice axe, Martha led the way downward.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The sixth floor was <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i>, too; military and technological history, from the character of the murals. They looked around the central hall, and went down to the fifth; it was like the floors above except that the big quadrangle was stacked with dusty furniture and boxes. Ivan Fitzgerald, who was carrying the floodlight, swung it slowly around. Here the murals were of heroic-sized Martians, so human in appearance as to seem members of her own race, each holding some object⁠—a book, or a test tube, or some bit of scientific apparatus, and behind them were scenes of laboratories and factories, flame and smoke, lightning-flashes. The word at the top of each of the four walls was one with which she was already familiar⁠—<i xml:lang="x-martian">Sornhulva</i>.</p>
			<p>“Hey, Martha; there’s that word,” Ivan Fitzgerald exclaimed. “The one in the title of your magazine.” He looked at the paintings. “Chemistry, or physics.”</p>
			<p>“Both.” Hubert Penrose considered. “I don’t think the Martians made any sharp distinction between them. See, the old fellow with the scraggly whiskers must be the inventor of the spectroscope; he has one in his hands, and he has a rainbow behind him. And the woman in the blue smock, beside him, worked in organic chemistry; see the diagrams of long-chain molecules behind her. What word would convey the idea of chemistry and physics taken as one subject?”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="x-martian">Sornhulva</i>,” Sachiko suggested. “If <i xml:lang="x-martian">hulva’s</i> something like science, ‘<i xml:lang="x-martian">sorn</i>’ must mean matter, or substance, or physical object. You were right, all along, Martha. A civilization like this would certainly leave something like this, that would be self-explanatory.”</p>
			<p>“This’ll wipe a little more of that superior grin off Tony Lattimer’s face,” Fitzgerald was saying, as they went down the motionless escalator to the floor below. “Tony wants to be a big shot. When you want to be a big shot, you can’t bear the possibility of anybody else being a bigger big shot, and whoever makes a start on reading this language will be the biggest big shot archaeology ever saw.”</p>
			<p>That was true. She hadn’t thought of it, in that way, before, and now she tried not to think about it. She didn’t want to be a big shot. She wanted to be able to read the Martian language, and find things out about the Martians.</p>
			<p>Two escalators down, they came out on a mezzanine around a wide central hall on the street level, the floor forty feet below them and the ceiling thirty feet above. Their lights picked out object after object below⁠—a huge group of sculptured figures in the middle; some kind of a motor vehicle jacked up on trestles for repairs; things that looked like machine-guns and auto-cannon; long tables, tops littered with a dust-covered miscellany; machinery; boxes and crates and containers.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They made their way down and walked among the clutter, missing a hundred things for every one they saw, until they found an escalator to the basement. There were three basements, one under another, until at last they stood at the bottom of the last escalator, on a bare concrete floor, swinging the portable floodlight over stacks of boxes and barrels and drums, and heaps of powdery dust. The boxes were plastic⁠—nobody had ever found anything made of wood in the city⁠—and the barrels and drums were of metal or glass or some glasslike substance. They were outwardly intact. The powdery heaps might have been anything organic, or anything containing fluid. Down here, where wind and dust could not reach, evaporation had been the only force of destruction after the minute life that caused putrefaction had vanished.</p>
			<p>They found refrigeration rooms, too, and using Martha’s ice axe and the pistollike vibratool Sachiko carried on her belt, they pounded and pried one open, to find dessicated piles of what had been vegetables, and leathery chunks of meat. Samples of that stuff, rocketed up to the ship, would give a reliable estimate, by radiocarbon dating, of how long ago this building had been occupied. The refrigeration unit, radically different from anything their own culture had produced, had been electrically powered. Sachiko and Penrose, poking into it, found the switches still on; the machine had only ceased to function when the power-source, whatever that had been, had failed.</p>
			<p>The middle basement had also been used, at least toward the end, for storage; it was cut in half by a partition pierced by but one door. They took half an hour to force this, and were on the point of sending above for heavy equipment when it yielded enough for them to squeeze through. Fitzgerald, in the lead with the light, stopped short, looked around, and then gave a groan that came through his helmet-speaker like a foghorn.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no! <em>No!</em>”</p>
			<p>“What’s the matter, Ivan?” Sachiko, entering behind him, asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>He stepped aside. “Look at it, Sachi! Are we going to have to do all that?”</p>
			<p>Martha crowded through behind her friend and looked around, then stood motionless, dizzy with excitement. Books. Case on case of books, half an acre of cases, fifteen feet to the ceiling. Fitzgerald, and Penrose, who had pushed in behind her, were talking in rapid excitement; she only heard the sound of their voices, not their words. This must be the main stacks of the university library⁠—the entire literature of the vanished race of Mars. In the center, down an aisle between the cases, she could see the hollow square of the librarians’ desk, and stairs and a dumbwaiter to the floor above.</p>
			<p>She realized that she was walking forward, with the others, toward this. Sachiko was saying: “I’m the lightest; let me go first.” She must be talking about the spidery metal stairs.</p>
			<p>“I’d say they were safe,” Penrose answered. “The trouble we’ve had with doors around here shows that the metal hasn’t deteriorated.”</p>
			<p>In the end, the Japanese girl led the way, more catlike than ever in her caution. The stairs were quite sound, in spite of their fragile appearance, and they all followed her. The floor above was a duplicate of the room they had entered, and seemed to contain about as many books. Rather than waste time forcing the door here, they returned to the middle basement and came up by the escalator down which they had originally descended.</p>
			<p>The upper basement contained kitchens⁠—electric stoves, some with pots and pans still on them⁠—and a big room that must have been, originally, the students’ dining room, though when last used it had been a workshop. As they expected, the library reading room was on the street-level floor, directly above the stacks. It seemed to have been converted into a sort of common living room for the building’s last occupants. An adjoining auditorium had been made into a chemical works; there were vats and distillation apparatus, and a metal fractionating tower that extended through a hole knocked in the ceiling seventy feet above. A good deal of plastic furniture of the sort they had been finding everywhere in the city was stacked about, some of it broken up, apparently for reprocessing. The other rooms on the street floor seemed also to have been devoted to manufacturing and repair work; a considerable industry, along a number of lines, must have been carried on here for a long time after the university had ceased to function as such.</p>
			<p>On the second floor, they found a museum; many of the exhibits remained, tantalizingly half-visible in grimed glass cases. There had been administrative offices there, too. The doors of most of them were closed, and they did not waste time trying to force them, but those that were open had been turned into living quarters. They made notes, and rough floor plans, to guide them in future more thorough examination; it was almost noon before they had worked their way back to the seventh floor.</p>
			<p>Selim von Ohlmhorst was in a room on the north side of the building, sketching the position of things before examining them and collecting them for removal. He had the floor checkerboarded with a grid of chalked lines, each numbered.</p>
			<p>“We have everything on this floor photographed,” he said. “I have three gangs⁠—all the floodlights I have⁠—sketching and making measurements. At the rate we’re going, with time out for lunch, we’ll be finished by the middle of the afternoon.”</p>
			<p>“You’ve been working fast. Evidently you aren’t being high-church about a ‘qualified archaeologist’ entering rooms first,” Penrose commented.</p>
			<p>“Ach, childishness!” the old man exclaimed impatiently. “These officers of yours aren’t fools. All of them have been to Intelligence School and Criminal Investigation School. Some of the most careful amateur archaeologists I ever knew were retired soldiers or policemen. But there isn’t much work to be done. Most of the rooms are either empty or like this one⁠—a few bits of furniture and broken trash and scraps of paper. Did you find anything down on the lower floors?”</p>
			<p>“Well, yes,” Penrose said, a hint of mirth in his voice. “What would you say, Martha?”</p>
			<p>She started to tell Selim. The others, unable to restrain their excitement, broke in with interruptions. Von Ohlmhorst was staring in incredulous amazement.</p>
			<p>“But this floor was looted almost clean, and the buildings we’ve entered before were all looted from the street level up,” he said, at length.</p>
			<p>“The people who looted this one lived here,” Penrose replied. “They had electric power to the last; we found refrigerators full of food, and stoves with the dinner still on them. They must have used the elevators to haul things down from the upper floor. The whole first floor was converted into workshops and laboratories. I think that this place must have been something like a monastery in the Dark Ages in Europe, or what such a monastery would have been like if the Dark Ages had followed the fall of a highly developed scientific civilization. For one thing, we found a lot of machine guns and light auto-cannon on the street level, and all the doors were barricaded. The people here were trying to keep a civilization running after the rest of the planet had gone back to barbarism; I suppose they’d have to fight off raids by the barbarians now and then.”</p>
			<p>“You’re not going to insist on making this building into expedition quarters, I hope, colonel?” von Ohlmhorst asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no! This place is an archaeological treasure-house. More than that; from what I saw, our technicians can learn a lot, here. But you’d better get this floor cleaned up as soon as you can, though. I’ll have the subsurface part, from the sixth floor down, airsealed. Then we’ll put in oxygen generators and power units, and get a couple of elevators into service. For the floors above, we can use temporary airsealing floor by floor, and portable equipment; when we have things atmosphered and lighted and heated, you and Martha and Tony Lattimer can go to work systematically and in comfort, and I’ll give you all the help I can spare from the other work. This is one of the biggest things we’ve found yet.”</p>
			<p>Tony Lattimer and his companions came down to the seventh floor a little later.</p>
			<p>“I don’t get this, at all,” he began, as soon as he joined them. “This building wasn’t stripped the way the others were. Always, the procedure seems to have been to strip from the bottom up, but they seem to have stripped the top floors first, here. All but the very top. I found out what that conical thing is, by the way. It’s a wind-rotor, and under it there’s an electric generator. This building generated its own power.”</p>
			<p>“What sort of condition are the generators in?” Penrose asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, everything’s full of dust that blew in under the rotor, of course, but it looks to be in pretty good shape. Hey, I’ll bet that’s it! They had power, so they used the elevators to haul stuff down. That’s just what they did. Some of the floors above here don’t seem to have been touched, though.” He paused momentarily; back of his oxy-mask, he seemed to be grinning. “I don’t know that I ought to mention this in front of Martha, but two floors above⁠—we hit a room⁠—it must have been the reference library for one of the departments⁠—that had close to five hundred books in it.”</p>
			<p>The noise that interrupted him, like the squawking of a Brobdingnagian parrot, was only Ivan Fitzgerald laughing through his helmet-speaker.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Lunch at the huts was a hasty meal, with a gabble of full-mouthed and excited talking. Hubert Penrose and his chief subordinates snatched their food in a huddled consultation at one end of the table; in the afternoon, work was suspended on everything else and the fifty-odd men and women of the expedition concentrated their efforts on the University. By the middle of the afternoon, the seventh floor had been completely examined, photographed and sketched, and the murals in the square central hall covered with protective tarpaulins, and Laurent Gicquel and his airsealing crew had moved in and were at work. It had been decided to seal the central hall at the entrances. It took the French-Canadian engineer most of the afternoon to find all the ventilation-ducts and plug them. An elevator-shaft on the north side was found reaching clear to the twenty-fifth floor; this would give access to the top of the building; another shaft, from the center, would take care of the floors below. Nobody seemed willing to trust the ancient elevators, themselves; it was the next evening before a couple of cars and the necessary machinery could be fabricated in the machine shops aboard the ship and sent down by landing-rocket. By that time, the airsealing was finished, the nuclear-electric energy-converters were in place, and the oxygen generators set up.</p>
			<p>Martha was in the lower basement, an hour or so before lunch the day after, when a couple of Space Force officers came out of the elevator, bringing extra lights with them. She was still using oxygen-equipment; it was a moment before she realized that the newcomers had no masks, and that one of them was smoking. She took off her own helmet-speaker, throat-mike and mask and unslung her tank-pack, breathing cautiously. The air was chilly, and musty-acrid with the odor of antiquity⁠—the first Martian odor she had smelled⁠—but when she lit a cigarette, the lighter flamed clear and steady and the tobacco caught and burned evenly.</p>
			<p>The archaeologists, many of the other civilian scientists, a few of the Space Force officers and the two news-correspondents, Sid Chamberlain and Gloria Standish, moved in that evening, setting up cots in vacant rooms. They installed electric stoves and a refrigerator in the old Library Reading Room, and put in a bar and lunch counter. For a few days, the place was full of noise and activity, then, gradually, the Space Force people and all but a few of the civilians returned to their own work. There was still the business of airsealing the more habitable of the buildings already explored, and fitting them up in readiness for the arrival, in a year and a half, of the five hundred members of the main expedition. There was work to be done enlarging the landing field for the ship’s rocket craft, and building new chemical-fuel tanks.</p>
			<p>There was the work of getting the city’s ancient reservoirs cleared of silt before the next spring thaw brought more water down the underground aqueducts everybody called canals in mistranslation of Schiaparelli’s Italian word, though this was proving considerably easier than anticipated. The ancient Canal-Builders must have anticipated a time when their descendants would no longer be capable of maintenance work, and had prepared against it. By the day after the University had been made completely habitable, the actual work there was being done by Selim, Tony Lattimer and herself, with half a dozen Space Force officers, mostly girls, and four or five civilians, helping.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They worked up from the bottom, dividing the floor-surfaces into numbered squares, measuring and listing and sketching and photographing. They packaged samples of organic matter and sent them up to the ship for Carbon-14 dating and analysis; they opened cans and jars and bottles, and found that everything fluid in them had evaporated, through the porosity of glass and metal and plastic if there were no other way. Wherever they looked, they found evidence of activity suddenly suspended and never resumed. A vise with a bar of metal in it, half cut through and the hacksaw beside it. Pots and pans with hardened remains of food in them; a leathery cut of meat on a table, with the knife ready at hand. Toilet articles on washstands; unmade beds, the bedding ready to crumble at a touch but still retaining the impress of the sleeper’s body; papers and writing materials on desks, as though the writer had gotten up, meaning to return and finish in a fifty-thousand-year-ago moment.</p>
			<p>It worried her. Irrationally, she began to feel that the Martians had never left this place; that they were still around her, watching disapprovingly every time she picked up something they had laid down. They haunted her dreams, now, instead of their enigmatic writing. At first, everybody who had moved into the University had taken a separate room, happy to escape the crowding and lack of privacy of the huts. After a few nights, she was glad when Gloria Standish moved in with her, and accepted the newswoman’s excuse that she felt lonely without somebody to talk to before falling asleep. Sachiko Koremitsu joined them the next evening, and before going to bed, the girl officer cleaned and oiled her pistol, remarking that she was afraid some rust may have gotten into it.</p>
			<p>The others felt it, too. Selim von Ohlmhorst developed the habit of turning quickly and looking behind him, as though trying to surprise somebody or something that was stalking him. Tony Lattimer, having a drink at the bar that had been improvised from the librarian’s desk in the Reading Room, set down his glass and swore.</p>
			<p>“You know what this place is? It’s an archaeological <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Marie Celeste</i>!” he declared. “It was occupied right up to the end⁠—we’ve all seen the shifts these people used to keep a civilization going here⁠—but what was the end? What happened to them? Where did they go?”</p>
			<p>“You didn’t expect them to be waiting out front, with a red carpet and a big banner, <q>Welcome Terrans</q>, did you, Tony?” Gloria Standish asked.</p>
			<p>“No, of course not; they’ve all been dead for fifty thousand years. But if they were the last of the Martians, why haven’t we found their bones, at least? Who buried them, after they were dead?” He looked at the glass, a bubble-thin goblet, found, with hundreds of others like it, in a closet above, as though debating with himself whether to have another drink. Then he voted in the affirmative and reached for the cocktail pitcher. “And every door on the old ground level is either barred or barricaded from the inside. How did they get out? And why did they leave?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The next day, at lunch, Sachiko Koremitsu had the answer to the second question. Four or five electrical engineers had come down by rocket from the ship, and she had been spending the morning with them, in oxy-masks, at the top of the building.</p>
			<p>“Tony, I thought you said those generators were in good shape,” she began, catching sight of Lattimer. “They aren’t. They’re in the most unholy mess I ever saw. What happened, up there, was that the supports of the wind-rotor gave way, and weight snapped the main shaft, and smashed everything under it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, after fifty thousand years, you can expect something like that,” Lattimer retorted. “When an archaeologist says something’s in good shape, he doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll start as soon as you shove a switch in.”</p>
			<p>“You didn’t notice that it happened when the power was on, did you,” one of the engineers asked, nettled at Lattimer’s tone. “Well, it was. Everything’s burned out or shorted or fused together; I saw one busbar eight inches across melted clean in two. It’s a pity we didn’t find things in good shape, even archaeologically speaking. I saw a lot of interesting things, things in advance of what we’re using now. But it’ll take a couple of years to get everything sorted out and figure what it looked like originally.”</p>
			<p>“Did it look as though anybody’d made any attempt to fix it?” Martha asked.</p>
			<p>Sachiko shook her head. “They must have taken one look at it and given up. I don’t believe there would have been any possible way to repair anything.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that explains why they left. They needed electricity for lighting, and heating, and all their industrial equipment was electrical. They had a good life, here, with power; without it, this place wouldn’t have been habitable.”</p>
			<p>“Then why did they barricade everything from the inside, and how did they get out?” Lattimer wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“To keep other people from breaking in and looting. Last man out probably barred the last door and slid down a rope from upstairs,” von Ohlmhorst suggested. “This Houdini-trick doesn’t worry me too much. We’ll find out eventually.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, about the time Martha starts reading Martian,” Lattimer scoffed.</p>
			<p>“That may be just when we’ll find out,” von Ohlmhorst replied seriously. “It wouldn’t surprise me if they left something in writing when they evacuated this place.”</p>
			<p>“Are you really beginning to treat this pipe dream of hers as a serious possibility, Selim?” Lattimer demanded. “I know, it would be a wonderful thing, but wonderful things don’t happen just because they’re wonderful. Only because they’re possible, and this isn’t. Let me quote that distinguished Hittitologist, Johannes Friedrich: ‘Nothing can be translated out of nothing.’ Or that later but not less distinguished Hittitologist, Selim von Ohlmhorst: ‘Where are you going to get your bilingual?’ ”</p>
			<p>“Friedrich lived to see the Hittite language deciphered and read,” von Ohlmhorst reminded him.</p>
			<p>“Yes, when they found Hittite-Assyrian bilinguals.” Lattimer measured a spoonful of coffee-powder into his cup and added hot water. “Martha, you ought to know, better than anybody, how little chance you have. You’ve been working for years in the Indus Valley; how many words of Harappa have you or anybody else ever been able to read?”</p>
			<p>“We never found a university, with a half-million-volume library, at Harappa or Mohenjo-Daro.”</p>
			<p>“And, the first day we entered this building, we established meanings for several words,” Selim von Ohlmhorst added.</p>
			<p>“And you’ve never found another meaningful word since,” Lattimer added. “And you’re only sure of general meaning, not specific meaning of word-elements, and you have a dozen different interpretations for each word.”</p>
			<p>“We made a start,” von Ohlmhorst maintained. “We have Grotefend’s word for ‘king.’ But I’m going to be able to read some of those books, over there, if it takes me the rest of my life here. It probably will, anyhow.”</p>
			<p>“You mean you’ve changed your mind about going home on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Cyrano</i>?” Martha asked. “You’ll stay on here?”</p>
			<p>The old man nodded. “I can’t leave this. There’s too much to discover. The old dog will have to learn a lot of new tricks, but this is where my work will be, from now on.”</p>
			<p>Lattimer was shocked. “You’re nuts!” he cried. “You mean you’re going to throw away everything you’ve accomplished in Hittitology and start all over again here on Mars? Martha, if you’ve talked him into this crazy decision, you’re a criminal!”</p>
			<p>“Nobody talked me into anything,” von Ohlmhorst said roughly. “And as for throwing away what I’ve accomplished in Hittitology, I don’t know what the devil you’re talking about. Everything I know about the Hittite Empire is published and available to anybody. Hittitology’s like Egyptology; it’s stopped being research and archaeology and become scholarship and history. And I’m not a scholar or a historian; I’m a pick-and-shovel field archaeologist⁠—a highly skilled and specialized grave-robber and junk-picker⁠—and there’s more pick-and-shovel work on this planet than I could do in a hundred lifetimes. This is something new; I was a fool to think I could turn my back on it and go back to scribbling footnotes about Hittite kings.”</p>
			<p>“You could have anything you wanted, in Hittitology. There are a dozen universities that’d sooner have you than a winning football team. But no! You have to be the top man in Martiology, too. You can’t leave that for anybody else⁠—” Lattimer shoved his chair back and got to his feet, leaving the table with an oath that was almost a sob of exasperation.</p>
			<p>Maybe his feelings were too much for him. Maybe he realized, as Martha did, what he had betrayed. She sat, avoiding the eyes of the others, looking at the ceiling, as embarrassed as though Lattimer had flung something dirty on the table in front of them. Tony Lattimer had, desperately, wanted Selim to go home on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Cyrano</i>. Martiology was a new field; if Selim entered it, he would bring with him the reputation he had already built in Hittitology, automatically stepping into the leading role that Lattimer had coveted for himself. Ivan Fitzgerald’s words echoed back to her⁠—when you want to be a big shot, you can’t bear the possibility of anybody else being a bigger big shot. His derision of her own efforts became comprehensible, too. It wasn’t that he was convinced that she would never learn to read the Martian language. He had been afraid that she would.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Ivan Fitzgerald finally isolated the germ that had caused the Finchley girl’s undiagnosed illness. Shortly afterward, the malady turned into a mild fever, from which she recovered. Nobody else seemed to have caught it. Fitzgerald was still trying to find out how the germ had been transmitted.</p>
			<p>They found a globe of Mars, made when the city had been a seaport. They located the city, and learned that its name had been Kukan⁠—or something with a similar vowel-consonant ratio. Immediately, Sid Chamberlain and Gloria Standish began giving their telecasts a Kukan dateline, and Hubert Penrose used the name in his official reports. They also found a Martian calendar; the year had been divided into ten more or less equal months, and one of them had been <i xml:lang="x-martian">Doma</i>. Another month was <i xml:lang="x-martian">Nor</i>, and that was a part of the name of the scientific journal Martha had found.</p>
			<p>Bill Chandler, the zoologist, had been going deeper and deeper into the old sea bottom of Syrtis. Four hundred miles from Kukan, and at fifteen thousand feet lower altitude, he shot a bird. At least, it was a something with wings and what were almost but not quite feathers, though it was more reptilian than avian in general characteristics. He and Ivan Fitzgerald skinned and mounted it, and then dissected the carcass almost tissue by tissue. About seven-eighths of its body capacity was lungs; it certainly breathed air containing at least half enough oxygen to support human life, or five times as much as the air around Kukan.</p>
			<p>That took the center of interest away from archaeology, and started a new burst of activity. All the expedition’s aircraft⁠—four jetticopters and three wingless airdyne reconnaissance fighters⁠—were thrown into intensified exploration of the lower sea bottoms, and the bio-science boys and girls were wild with excitement and making new discoveries on each flight.</p>
			<p>The University was left to Selim and Martha and Tony Lattimer, the latter keeping to himself while she and the old Turco-German worked together. The civilian specialists in other fields, and the Space Force people who had been holding tape lines and making sketches and snapping cameras, were all flying to lower Syrtis to find out how much oxygen there was and what kind of life it supported.</p>
			<p>Sometimes Sachiko dropped in; most of the time she was busy helping Ivan Fitzgerald dissect specimens. They had four or five species of what might loosely be called birds, and something that could easily be classed as a reptile, and a carnivorous mammal the size of a cat with birdlike claws, and a herbivore almost identical with the piglike thing in the big <i xml:lang="x-martian">Darfhulva</i> mural, and another like a gazelle with a single horn in the middle of its forehead.</p>
			<p>The high point came when one party, at thirty thousand feet below the level of Kukan, found breathable air. One of them had a mild attack of <i xml:lang="es">soroche</i> and had to be flown back for treatment in a hurry, but the others showed no ill effects.</p>
			<p>The daily newscasts from Terra showed a corresponding shift in interest at home. The discovery of the University had focused attention on the dead past of Mars; now the public was interested in Mars as a possible home for humanity. It was Tony Lattimer who brought archaeology back into the activities of the expedition and the news at home.</p>
			<p>Martha and Selim were working in the museum on the second floor, scrubbing the grime from the glass cases, noting contents, and grease-penciling numbers; Lattimer and a couple of Space Force officers were going through what had been the administrative offices on the other side. It was one of these, a young second lieutenant, who came hurrying in from the mezzanine, almost bursting with excitement.</p>
			<p>“Hey, Martha! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> von Ohlmhorst!” he was shouting. “Where are you? Tony’s found the Martians!”</p>
			<p>Selim dropped his rag back in the bucket; she laid her clipboard on top of the case beside her.</p>
			<p>“Where?” they asked together.</p>
			<p>“Over on the north side.” The lieutenant took hold of himself and spoke more deliberately. “Little room, back of one of the old faculty offices⁠—conference room. It was locked from the inside, and we had to burn it down with a torch. That’s where they are. Eighteen of them, around a long table⁠—”</p>
			<p>Gloria Standish, who had dropped in for lunch, was on the mezzanine, fairly screaming into a radiophone extension:</p>
			<p>“… Dozen and a half of them! Well, of course they’re dead. What a question! They look like skeletons covered with leather. No, I do not know what they died of. Well, forget it; I don’t care if Bill Chandler’s found a three-headed hippopotamus. Sid, don’t you get it? We’ve found the <em>Martians</em>!”</p>
			<p>She slammed the phone back on its hook, rushing away ahead of them.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Martha remembered the closed door; on the first survey, they hadn’t attempted opening it. Now it was burned away at both sides and lay, still hot along the edges, on the floor of the big office room in front. A floodlight was on in the room inside, and Lattimer was going around looking at things while a Space Force officer stood by the door. The center of the room was filled by a long table; in armchairs around it sat the eighteen men and women who had occupied the room for the last fifty millennia. There were bottles and glasses on the table in front of them, and, had she seen them in a dimmer light, she would have thought that they were merely dozing over their drinks. One had a knee hooked over his chair-arm and was curled in foetuslike sleep. Another had fallen forward onto the table, arms extended, the emerald set of a ring twinkling dully on one finger. Skeletons covered with leather, Gloria Standish had called them, and so they were⁠—faces like skulls, arms and legs like sticks, the flesh shrunken onto the bones under it.</p>
			<p>“Isn’t this something!” Lattimer was exulting. “Mass suicide, that’s what it was. Notice what’s in the corners?”</p>
			<p>Braziers, made of perforated two-gallon-odd metal cans, the white walls smudged with smoke above them. Von Ohlmhorst had noticed them at once, and was poking into one of them with his flashlight.</p>
			<p>“Yes; charcoal. I noticed a quantity of it around a couple of hand-forges in the shop on the first floor. That’s why you had so much trouble breaking in; they’d sealed the room on the inside.” He straightened and went around the room, until he found a ventilator, and peered into it. “Stuffed with rags. They must have been all that were left, here. Their power was gone, and they were old and tired, and all around them their world was dying. So they just came in here and lit the charcoal, and sat drinking together till they all fell asleep. Well, we know what became of them, now, anyhow.”</p>
			<p>Sid and Gloria made the most of it. The Terran public wanted to hear about Martians, and if live Martians couldn’t be found, a room full of dead ones was the next best thing. Maybe an even better thing; it had been only sixty-odd years since the Orson Welles invasion-scare. Tony Lattimer, the discoverer, was beginning to cash in on his attentions to Gloria and his ingratiation with Sid; he was always either making voice-and-image talks for telecast or listening to the news from the home planet. Without question, he had become, overnight, the most widely known archaeologist in history.</p>
			<p>“Not that I’m interested in all this, for myself,” he disclaimed, after listening to the telecast from Terra two days after his discovery. “But this is going to be a big thing for Martian archaeology. Bring it to the public attention; dramatize it. Selim, can you remember when Lord Carnarvon and Howard Carter found the tomb of Tutankhamen?”</p>
			<p>“In 1923? I was two years old, then,” von Ohlmhorst chuckled. “I really don’t know how much that publicity ever did for Egyptology. Oh, the museums did devote more space to Egyptian exhibits, and after a museum department head gets a few extra showcases, you know how hard it is to make him give them up. And, for a while, it was easier to get financial support for new excavations. But I don’t know how much good all this public excitement really does, in the long run.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I think one of us should go back on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Cyrano</i>, when the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Schiaparelli</i> orbits in,” Lattimer said. “I’d hoped it would be you; your voice would carry the most weight. But I think it’s important that one of us go back, to present the story of our work, and what we have accomplished and what we hope to accomplish, to the public and to the universities and the learned societies, and to the Federation Government. There will be a great deal of work that will have to be done. We must not allow the other scientific fields and the so-called practical interests to monopolize public and academic support. So, I believe I shall go back at least for a while, and see what I can do⁠—”</p>
			<p>Lectures. The organization of a Society of Martian Archaeology, with Anthony Lattimer, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Ph. D.</abbr>, the logical candidate for the chair. Degrees, honors; the deference of the learned, and the adulation of the lay public. Positions, with impressive titles and salaries. Sweet are the uses of publicity.</p>
			<p>She crushed out her cigarette and got to her feet. “Well, I still have the final lists of what we found in <i xml:lang="x-martian">Halvhulva</i>⁠—Biology⁠—department to check over. I’m starting on <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sornhulva</i> tomorrow, and I want that stuff in shape for expert evaluation.”</p>
			<p>That was the sort of thing Tony Lattimer wanted to get away from, the detail-work and the drudgery. Let the infantry do the slogging through the mud; the brass-hats got the medals.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>She was halfway through the fifth floor, a week later, and was having midday lunch in the reading room on the first floor when Hubert Penrose came over and sat down beside her, asking her what she was doing. She told him.</p>
			<p>“I wonder if you could find me a couple of men, for an hour or so,” she added. “I’m stopped by a couple of jammed doors at the central hall. Lecture room and library, if the layout of that floor’s anything like the ones below it.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. I’m a pretty fair door-buster, myself.” He looked around the room. “There’s Jeff Miles; he isn’t doing much of anything. And we’ll put Sid Chamberlain to work, for a change, too. The four of us ought to get your doors open.” He called to Chamberlain, who was carrying his tray over to the dish washer. “Oh, Sid; you doing anything for the next hour or so?”</p>
			<p>“I was going up to the fourth floor, to see what Tony’s doing.”</p>
			<p>“Forget it. Tony’s bagged his season limit of Martians. I’m going to help Martha bust in a couple of doors; we’ll probably find a whole cemetery full of Martians.”</p>
			<p>Chamberlain shrugged. “Why not. A jammed door can have anything back of it, and I know what Tony’s doing⁠—just routine stuff.”</p>
			<p>Jeff Miles, the Space Force captain, came over, accompanied by one of the lab-crew from the ship who had come down on the rocket the day before.</p>
			<p>“This ought to be up your alley, Mort,” he was saying to his companion. “Chemistry and physics department. Want to come along?”</p>
			<p>The lab man, Mort Tranter, was willing. Seeing the sights was what he’d come down from the ship for. She finished her coffee and cigarette, and they went out into the hall together, gathered equipment and rode the elevator to the fifth floor.</p>
			<p>The lecture hall door was the nearest; they attacked it first. With proper equipment and help, it was no problem and in ten minutes they had it open wide enough to squeeze through with the floodlights. The room inside was quite empty, and, like most of the rooms behind closed doors, comparatively free from dust. The students, it appeared, had sat with their backs to the door, facing a low platform, but their seats and the lecturer’s table and equipment had been removed. The two side walls bore inscriptions: on the right, a pattern of concentric circles which she recognized as a diagram of atomic structure, and on the left a complicated table of numbers and words, in two columns. Tranter was pointing at the diagram on the right.</p>
			<p>“They got as far as the Bohr atom, anyhow,” he said. “Well, not quite. They knew about electron shells, but they have the nucleus pictured as a solid mass. No indication of proton-and-neutron structure. I’ll bet, when you come to translate their scientific books, you’ll find that they taught that the atom was the ultimate and indivisible particle. That explains why you people never found any evidence that the Martians used nuclear energy.”</p>
			<p>“That’s a uranium atom,” Captain Miles mentioned.</p>
			<p>“It is?” Sid Chamberlain asked, excitedly. “Then they did know about atomic energy. Just because we haven’t found any pictures of A-bomb mushrooms doesn’t mean⁠—”</p>
			<p>She turned to look at the other wall. Sid’s signal reactions were getting away from him again; uranium meant nuclear power to him, and the two words were interchangeable. As she studied the arrangement of the numbers and words, she could hear Tranter saying:</p>
			<p>“Nuts, Sid. We knew about uranium a long time before anybody found out what could be done with it. Uranium was discovered on Terra in 1789, by Klaproth.”</p>
			<p>There was something familiar about the table on the left wall. She tried to remember what she had been taught in school about physics, and what she had picked up by accident afterward. The second column was a continuation of the first: there were forty-six items in each, each item numbered consecutively⁠—</p>
			<p>“Probably used uranium because it’s the largest of the natural atoms,” Penrose was saying. “The fact that there’s nothing beyond it there shows that they hadn’t created any of the transuranics. A student could go to that thing and point out the outer electron of any of the ninety-two elements.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Ninety-two! That was it; there were ninety-two items in the table on the left wall! Hydrogen was Number One, she knew; One, <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sarfaldsorn</i>. Helium was Two; that was <i xml:lang="x-martian">Tirfaldsorn</i>. She couldn’t remember which element came next, but in Martian it was <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sarfalddavas</i>. <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sorn</i> must mean matter, or substance, then. And <i xml:lang="x-martian">davas</i>; she was trying to think of what it could be. She turned quickly to the others, catching hold of Hubert Penrose’s arm with one hand and waving her clipboard with the other.</p>
			<p>“Look at this thing, over here,” she was clamoring excitedly. “Tell me what you think it is. Could it be a table of the elements?”</p>
			<p>They all turned to look. Mort Tranter stared at it for a moment.</p>
			<p>“Could be. If I only knew what those squiggles meant⁠—”</p>
			<p>That was right; he’d spent his time aboard the ship.</p>
			<p>“If you could read the numbers, would that help?” she asked, beginning to set down the Arabic digits and their Martian equivalents. “It’s decimal system, the same as we use.”</p>
			<p>“Sure. If that’s a table of elements, all I’d need would be the numbers. Thanks,” he added as she tore off the sheet and gave it to him.</p>
			<p>Penrose knew the numbers, and was ahead of him. “Ninety-two items, numbered consecutively. The first number would be the atomic number. Then a single word, the name of the element. Then the atomic weight⁠—”</p>
			<p>She began reading off the names of the elements. “I know hydrogen and helium; what’s <i xml:lang="x-martian">tirfalddavas</i>, the third one?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a></p>
			<p>“Lithium,” Tranter said. “The atomic weights aren’t run out past the decimal point. Hydrogen’s one plus, if that double-hook dingus is a plus sign; Helium’s four-plus, that’s right. And lithium’s given as seven, that isn’t right. It’s six-point nine-four-oh. Or is that thing a Martian minus sign?”</p>
			<p>“Of course! Look! A plus sign is a hook, to hang things together; a minus sign is a knife, to cut something off from something⁠—see, the little loop is the handle and the long pointed loop is the blade. Stylized, of course, but that’s what it is. And the fourth element, <i xml:lang="x-martian">kiradavas</i>; what’s that?”</p>
			<p>“Beryllium. Atomic weight given as nine-and-a-hook; actually it’s nine-point-oh-two.”</p>
			<p>Sid Chamberlain had been disgruntled because he couldn’t get a story about the Martians having developed atomic energy. It took him a few minutes to understand the newest development, but finally it dawned on him.</p>
			<p>“Hey! You’re reading that!” he cried. “You’re reading Martian!”</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” Penrose told him. “Just reading it right off. I don’t get the two items after the atomic weight, though. They look like months of the Martian calendar. What ought they to be, Mort?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Tranter hesitated. “Well, the next information after the atomic weight ought to be the period and group numbers. But those are words.”</p>
			<p>“What would the numbers be for the first one, hydrogen?”</p>
			<p>“Period One, Group One. One electron shell, one electron in the outer shell,” Tranter told her. “Helium’s period one, too, but it has the outer⁠—only⁠—electron shell full, so it’s in the group of inert elements.”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="x-martian">Trav, Trav.</i> <i xml:lang="x-martian">Trav’s</i> the first month of the year. And helium’s <i xml:lang="x-martian">Trav, Yenth</i>; <i xml:lang="x-martian">Yenth</i> is the eighth month.”</p>
			<p>“The inert elements could be called Group Eight, yes. And the third element, lithium, is Period Two, Group One. That check?”</p>
			<p>“It certainly does. <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sanv</i>, <i xml:lang="x-martian">Trav</i>; <i xml:lang="x-martian">Sanv’s</i> the second month. What’s the first element in Period Three?”</p>
			<p>“Sodium. Number Eleven.”</p>
			<p>That’s right; it’s <i xml:lang="x-martian">Krav</i>, <i xml:lang="x-martian">Trav</i>. Why, the names of the months are simply numbers, one to ten, spelled out.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="x-martian">Doma</i>’s the fifth month. That was your first Martian word, Martha,” Penrose told her. “The word for five. And if <i xml:lang="x-martian">davas</i> is the word for metal, and <i xml:lang="x-martian">sornhulva</i> is chemistry and/or physics, I’ll bet <i xml:lang="x-martian">Tadavas Sornhulva</i> is literally translated as: Of-Metal Matter-Knowledge. Metallurgy, in other words. I wonder what <i xml:lang="x-martian">Mastharnorvod</i> means.” It surprised her that, after so long and with so much happening in the meantime, he could remember that. “Something like ‘Journal,’ or ‘Review,’ or maybe ‘Quarterly.’ ”</p>
			<p>“We’ll work that out, too,” she said confidently. After this, nothing seemed impossible. “Maybe we can find⁠—” Then she stopped short. “You said ‘Quarterly.’ I think it was ‘Monthly,’ instead. It was dated for a specific month, the fifth one. And if <i xml:lang="x-martian">nor</i> is ten, Mastharnorvod could be ‘Year-Tenth.’ And I’ll bet we’ll find that <i xml:lang="x-martian">masthar</i> is the word for year.” She looked at the table on the wall again. “Well, let’s get all these words down, with translations for as many as we can.”</p>
			<p>“Let’s take a break for a minute,” Penrose suggested, getting out his cigarettes. “And then, let’s do this in comfort. Jeff, suppose you and Sid go across the hall and see what you find in the other room in the way of a desk or something like that, and a few chairs. There’ll be a lot of work to do on this.”</p>
			<p>Sid Chamberlain had been squirming as though he were afflicted with ants, trying to contain himself. Now he let go with an excited jabber.</p>
			<p>“This is really it! <em>The</em> it, not just it-of-the-week, like finding the reservoirs or those statues or this building, or even the animals and the dead Martians! Wait till Selim and Tony see this! Wait till Tony sees it; I want to see his face! And when I get this on telecast, all Terra’s going to go nuts about it!” He turned to Captain Miles. “Jeff, suppose you take a look at that other door, while I find somebody to send to tell Selim and Tony. And Gloria; wait till she sees this⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Take it easy, Sid,” Martha cautioned. “You’d better let me have a look at your script, before you go too far overboard on the telecast. This is just a beginning; it’ll take years and years before we’re able to read any of those books downstairs.”</p>
			<p>“It’ll go faster than you think, Martha,” Hubert Penrose told her. “We’ll all work on it, and we’ll teleprint material to Terra, and people there will work on it. We’ll send them everything we can⁠ ⁠… everything we work out, and copies of books, and copies of your word-lists⁠—”</p>
			<p>And there would be other tables⁠—astronomical tables, tables in physics and mechanics, for instance⁠—in which words and numbers were equivalent. The library stacks, below, would be full of them. Transliterate them into Roman alphabet spellings and Arabic numerals, and somewhere, somebody would spot each numerical significance, as Hubert Penrose and Mort Tranter and she had done with the table of elements. And pick out all the chemistry textbooks in the Library; new words would take on meaning from contexts in which the names of elements appeared. She’d have to start studying chemistry and physics, herself⁠—</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Sachiko Koremitsu peeped in through the door, then stepped inside.</p>
			<p>“Is there anything I can do⁠—?” she began. “What’s happened? Something important?”</p>
			<p>“Important?” Sid Chamberlain exploded. “Look at that, Sachi! We’re reading it! Martha’s found out how to read Martian!” He grabbed Captain Miles by the arm. “Come on, Jeff; let’s go. I want to call the others⁠—” He was still babbling as he hurried from the room.</p>
			<p>Sachi looked at the inscription. “Is it true?” she asked, and then, before Martha could more than begin to explain, flung her arms around her. “Oh, it really is! You are reading it! I’m so happy!”</p>
			<p>She had to start explaining again when Selim von Ohlmhorst entered. This time, she was able to finish.</p>
			<p>“But, Martha, can you be really sure? You know, by now, that learning to read this language is as important to me as it is to you, but how can you be so sure that those words really mean things like hydrogen and helium and boron and oxygen? How do you know that their table of elements was anything like ours?”</p>
			<p>Tranter and Penrose and Sachiko all looked at him in amazement.</p>
			<p>“That isn’t just the Martian table of elements; that’s <em>the</em> table of elements. It’s the only one there is.” Mort Tranter almost exploded. “Look, hydrogen has one proton and one electron. If it had more of either, it wouldn’t be hydrogen, it’d be something else. And the same with all the rest of the elements. And hydrogen on Mars is the same as hydrogen on Terra, or on Alpha Centauri, or in the next galaxy⁠—”</p>
			<p>“You just set up those numbers, in that order, and any first-year chemistry student could tell you what elements they represented.” Penrose said. “Could if he expected to make a passing grade, that is.”</p>
			<p>The old man shook his head slowly, smiling. “I’m afraid I wouldn’t make a passing grade. I didn’t know, or at least didn’t realize, that. One of the things I’m going to place an order for, to be brought on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Schiaparelli</i>, will be a set of primers in chemistry and physics, of the sort intended for a bright child of ten or twelve. It seems that a Martiologist has to learn a lot of things the Hittites and the Assyrians never heard about.”</p>
			<p>Tony Lattimer, coming in, caught the last part of the explanation. He looked quickly at the walls and, having found out just what had happened, advanced and caught Martha by the hand.</p>
			<p>“You really did it, Martha! You found your bilingual! I never believed that it would be possible; let me congratulate you!”</p>
			<p>He probably expected that to erase all the jibes and sneers of the past. If he did, he could have it that way. His friendship would mean as little to her as his derision⁠—except that his friends had to watch their backs and his knife. But he was going home on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Cyrano</i>, to be a big shot. Or had this changed his mind for him again?</p>
			<p>“This is something we can show the world, to justify any expenditure of time and money on Martian archaeological work. When I get back to Terra, I’ll see that you’re given full credit for this achievement⁠—”</p>
			<p>On Terra, her back and his knife would be out of her watchfulness.</p>
			<p>“We won’t need to wait that long,” Hubert Penrose told him dryly. “I’m sending off an official report, tomorrow; you can be sure <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Dane will be given full credit, not only for this but for her previous work, which made it possible to exploit this discovery.”</p>
			<p>“And you might add, work done in spite of the doubts and discouragements of her colleagues,” Selim von Ohlmhorst said. “To which I am ashamed to have to confess my own share.”</p>
			<p>“You said we had to find a bilingual,” she said. “You were right, too.”</p>
			<p>“This is better than a bilingual, Martha,” Hubert Penrose said. “Physical science expresses universal facts; necessarily it is a universal language. Heretofore archaeologists have dealt only with pre-scientific cultures.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Oomphel in the Sky</h2>
			<p>Miles Gilbert watched the landscape slide away below him, its quilt of rounded treetops mottled red and orange in the double sunlight and, in shaded places, with the natural yellow of the vegetation of Kwannon. The aircar began a slow swing to the left, and Gettler Alpha came into view, a monstrous smear of red incandescence with an optical diameter of two feet at arm’s length, slightly flattened on the bottom by the western horizon. In another couple of hours it would be completely set, but by that time Beta, the planet’s G-class primary, would be at its midafternoon hottest. He glanced at his watch. It was 1005, but that was Galactic Standard Time, and had no relevance to anything that was happening in the local sky. It did mean, though, that it was five minutes short of two hours to ’cast-time.</p>
			<p>He snapped on the communication screen in front of him, and Harry Walsh, the news editor, looked out of it at him from the office in Bluelake, halfway across the continent. He wanted to know how things were going.</p>
			<p>“Just about finished. I’m going to look in at a couple more native villages, and then I’m going to Sanders’ plantation to see Gonzales. I hope I’ll have a personal statement from him, and the final situation-progress map, in time for the ’cast. I take it Maith’s still agreeable to releasing the story at twelve-hundred?”</p>
			<p>“Sure; he was always agreeable. The Army wants publicity; it was Government House that wanted to sit on it, and they’ve given that up now. The story’s all over the place here, native city and all.”</p>
			<p>“What’s the situation in town, now?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, it’s still going on. Some disorders, mostly just unrest. Lot of street meetings that could have turned into frenzies if the police hadn’t broken them up in time. A couple of shootings, some sleep-gassing, and a lot of arrests. Nothing to worry about⁠—at least, not immediately.”</p>
			<p>That was about what he thought. “Maybe it’s not bad to have a little trouble in Bluelake,” he considered. “What happens out here in the plantation country the Government House crowd can’t see, and it doesn’t worry them. Well, I’ll call you from Sanders.’ ”</p>
			<p>He blanked the screen. In the seat in front, the native pilot said: “Some contragravity up ahead, boss.” It sounded like two voices speaking in unison, which was just what it was. “I’ll have a look.”</p>
			<p>The pilot’s hand, long and thin, like a squirrel’s, reached up and pulled down the fifty-power binoculars on their swinging arm. Miles looked at the screen-map and saw a native village just ahead of the dot of light that marked the position of the aircar. He spoke the native name of the village aloud, and added:</p>
			<p>“Let down there, Heshto. I’ll see what’s going on.”</p>
			<p>The native, still looking through the glasses, said, “Right, boss.” Then he turned.</p>
			<p>His skin was blue-gray and looked like sponge rubber. He was humanoid, to the extent of being an upright biped, with two arms, a head on top of shoulders, and a torso that housed, among other oddities, four lungs. His face wasn’t even vaguely human. He had two eyes in front, close enough for stereoscopic vision, but that was a common characteristic of sapient life forms everywhere. His mouth was strictly for eating; he breathed through separate intakes and outlets, one of each on either side of his neck; he talked through the outlets and had his scent and hearing organs in the intakes. The car was air-conditioned, which was a mercy; an overheated Kwann exhaled through his skin, and surrounded himself with stenches like an organic chemistry lab. But then, Kwanns didn’t come any closer to him than they could help when he was hot and sweated, which, lately, had been most of the time.</p>
			<p>“A <abbr>V</abbr> and a half of air cavalry, circling around,” Heshto said. “Making sure nobody got away. And a combat car at a couple of hundred feet and another one just at treetop level.”</p>
			<p>He rose and went to the seat next to the pilot, pulling down the binoculars that were focused for his own eyes. With them, he could see the air cavalry⁠—egg-shaped things just big enough for a seated man, with jets and contragravity field generators below and a bristle of machine gun muzzles in front. A couple of them jetted up for a look at him and then went slanting down again, having recognized the Kwannon Planetwide News Service car.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The village was typical enough to have been an illustration in a sociography textbook⁠—fields in a belt for a couple of hundred yards around it, dome-thatched mud-and-wattle huts inside a pole stockade with log storehouses built against it, their flat roofs high enough to provide platforms for defending archers, the open oval gathering-place in the middle. There was a big hut at one end of this, the khamdoo, the sanctum of the adult males, off limits for women and children. A small crowd was gathered in front of it; fifteen or twenty Terran air cavalrymen, a couple of enlisted men from the Second Kwannon Native Infantry, a Terran second lieutenant, and half a dozen natives. The rest of the village population, about two hundred, of both sexes and all ages, were lined up on the shadier side of the gathering-place, most of them looking up apprehensively at the two combat cars which were covering them with their guns.</p>
			<p>Miles got to his feet as the car lurched off contragravity and the springs of the landing-feet took up the weight. A blast of furnacelike air struck him when he opened the door; he got out quickly and closed it behind him. The second lieutenant had come over to meet him; he extended his hand.</p>
			<p>“Good day, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert. We all owe you our thanks for the warning. This would have been a real baddie if we hadn’t caught it when we did.”</p>
			<p>He didn’t even try to make any modest disclaimer; that was nothing more than the exact truth.</p>
			<p>“Well, lieutenant, I see you have things in hand here.” He glanced at the lineup along the side of the oval plaza, and then at the selected group in front of the khamdoo. The patriarchal village chieftain in a loose slashed shirt; the shoonoo, wearing a multiplicity of amulets and nothing else; four or five of the village elders. “I take it the word of the swarming didn’t get this far?”</p>
			<p>“No, this crowd still don’t know what the flap’s about, and I couldn’t think of anything to tell them that wouldn’t be worse than no explanation at all.”</p>
			<p>He had noticed hoes and spades flying in the fields, and the cylindrical plastic containers the natives bought from traders, dropped when the troops had surprised the women at work. And the shoonoo didn’t have a fire-dance cloak or any other special regalia on. If he’d heard about the swarming, he’d have been dressed to make magic for it.</p>
			<p>“What time did you get here, lieutenant?”</p>
			<p>“Oh-nine-forty. I just called in and reported the village occupied, and they told me I was the last one in, so the operation’s finished.”</p>
			<p>That had been smart work. He got the lieutenant’s name and unit and mentioned it into his memophone. That had been a little under five hours since he had convinced General Maith, in Bluelake, that the mass labor-desertion from the Sanders plantation had been the beginning of a swarming. Some division commanders wouldn’t have been able to get a brigade off the ground in that time, let alone landed on objective. He said as much to the young officer.</p>
			<p>“The way the Army responded, today, can make the people of the Colony feel a lot more comfortable for the future.”</p>
			<p>“Why, thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert.” The Army, on Kwannon, was rather more used to obloquy than praise. “How did you spot what was going on so quickly?”</p>
			<p>This was the hundredth time, at least, that he had been asked that today.</p>
			<p>“Well, Paul Sanders’ labor all comes from neighboring villages. If they’d just wanted to go home and spend the end of the world with their families, they’d have been dribbling away in small batches for the last couple of hundred hours. Instead, they all bugged out in a bunch, they took all the food they could carry and nothing else, and they didn’t make any trouble before they left. Then, Sanders said they’d been building fires out in the fallow ground and moaning and chanting around them for a couple of days, and idling on the job. Saving their strength for the trek. And he said they had a shoonoo among them. He’s probably the lad who started it. Had a dream from the Gone Ones, I suppose.”</p>
			<p>“You mean, like this fellow here?” the lieutenant asked. “What are they, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert; priests?”</p>
			<p>He looked quickly at the lieutenant’s collar-badges. Yellow trefoil for Third Fleet-Army Force, Roman <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> for Fourth Army, 907 for his regiment, with C under it for cavalry. That outfit had only been on Kwannon for the last two thousand hours, but somebody should have briefed him better than that.</p>
			<p>He shook his head. “No, they’re magicians. Everything these Kwanns do involves magic, and the shoonoon are the professionals. When a native runs into something serious, that his own do-it-yourself magic can’t cope with, he goes to the shoonoo. And, of course, the shoonoo works all the magic for the community as a whole⁠—rain-magic, protective magic for the village and the fields, that sort of thing.”</p>
			<p>The lieutenant mopped his face on a bedraggled handkerchief. “They’ll have to struggle along somehow for a while; we have orders to round up all the shoonoon and send them in to Bluelake.”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” That hadn’t been General Maith’s idea; the governor had insisted on that. “I hope it doesn’t make more trouble than it prevents.”</p>
			<p>The lieutenant was still mopping his face and looking across the gathering-place toward Alpha, glaring above the huts.</p>
			<p>“How much worse do you think this is going to get?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“The heat, or the native troubles?”</p>
			<p>“I was thinking about the heat, but both.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it’ll get hotter. Not much hotter, but some. We can expect storms, too, within twelve to fifteen hundred hours. Nobody has any idea how bad they’ll be. The last periastron was ninety years ago, and we’ve only been here for sixty-odd; all we have is verbal accounts from memory from the natives, probably garbled and exaggerated. We had pretty bad storms right after transit a year ago; they’ll be much worse this time. Thermal convections; air starts to cool when it gets dark, and then heats up again in double-sun daylight.”</p>
			<p>It was beginning, even now; starting to blow a little after Alpha-rise.</p>
			<p>“How about the natives?” the lieutenant asked. “If they can get any crazier than they are now⁠—”</p>
			<p>“They can, and they probably will. They think this is the end of the world. The Last Hot Time.” He used the native expression, and then translated it into Lingua Terra. “The Sky Fire⁠—that’s Alpha⁠—will burn up the whole world.”</p>
			<p>“But this happens every ninety years. Mean they always acted this way at periastron?”</p>
			<p>He shook his head. “Race would have exterminated itself long ago if they had. No, this is something special. The coming of the Terrans was a sign. The Terrans came and brought oomphel to the world; this a sign that the Last Hot Time is at hand.”</p>
			<p>“What the devil <em>is</em> oomphel?” The lieutenant was mopping the back of his neck with one hand, now, and trying to pull his sticky tunic loose from his body with the other. “I hear that word all the time.”</p>
			<p>“Well, most Terrans, including the old Kwannon hands, use it to mean trade-goods. To the natives, it means any product of Terran technology, from paperclips to spaceships. They think it’s⁠ ⁠… well, not exactly supernatural; extranatural would be closer to expressing their idea. Terrans are natural; they’re just a different kind of people. But oomphel isn’t; it isn’t subject to any of the laws of nature at all. They’re all positive that we don’t make it. Some of them even think it makes us.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>When he got back in the car, the native pilot, Heshto, was lolling in his seat and staring at the crowd of natives along the side of the gathering-place with undisguised disdain. Heshto had been educated at one of the Native Welfare Commission schools, and post-graded with Kwannon Planetwide News. He could speak, read and write Lingua Terra. He was a mathematician as far as long division and decimal fractions. He knew that Kwannon was the second planet of the Gettler Beta system, 23,000 miles in circumference, rotating on its axis once in 22.8 Galactic Standard hours and making an orbital circuit around Gettler Beta once in 372.06 axial days, and that Alpha was an M-class pulsating variable with an average period of four hundred days, and that Beta orbited around it in a long elipse every ninety years. He didn’t believe there was going to be a Last Hot Time. He was an intellectual, he was.</p>
			<p>He started the contragravity-field generator as soon as Miles was in his seat. “Where now, boss?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Qualpha’s Village. We won’t let down; just circle low over it. I want some views of the ruins. Then to Sanders’ plantation.”</p>
			<p>“OK, boss; hold tight.”</p>
			<p>He had the car up to ten thousand feet. Aiming it in the map direction of Qualpha’s Village, he let go with everything he had⁠—hot jets, rocket-booster and all. The forest landscape came hurtling out of the horizon toward them.</p>
			<p>Qualpha’s was where the trouble had first broken out, after the bug-out from Sanders; the troops hadn’t been able to get there in time, and it had been burned. Another village, about the same distance south of the plantation, had also gone up in flames, and at a dozen more they had found the natives working themselves into frenzies and had had to sleep-gas them or stun them with concussion-bombs. Those had been the villages to which the deserters from Sanders’ had themselves gone; from every one, runners had gone out to neighboring villages⁠—“The Gone Ones are returning; all the People go to greet them at the Deesha-Phoo. Burn your villages; send on the word. Hasten; the Gone Ones return!”</p>
			<p>Saving some of those villages had been touch-and-go, too; the runners, with hours lead-time, had gotten there ahead of the troops, and there had been shooting at a couple of them. Then the Army contragravity began landing at villages that couldn’t have been reached in hours by foot messengers. It had been stopped⁠—at least for the time, and in this area. When and where another would break out was anybody’s guess.</p>
			<p>The car was slowing and losing altitude, and ahead he could see thin smoke rising above the trees. He moved forward beside the pilot and pulled down his glasses; with them he could distinguish the ruins of the village. He called Bluelake, and then put his face to the viewfinder and began transmitting in the view.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It had been a village like the one he had just visited, mud-and-wattle huts around an oval gathering-place, stockade, and fields beyond. Heshto brought the car down to a few hundred feet and came coasting in on momentum helped by an occasional spurt of the cold-jets. A few sections of the stockade still stood, and one side of the khamdoo hadn’t fallen, but the rest of the structures were flat. There wasn’t a soul, human or parahuman, in sight; the only living thing was a small black-and-gray quadruped investigating some bundles that had been dropped in the fields, in hope of finding something tasty. He got a view of that⁠—everybody liked animal pictures on a newscast⁠—and then he was swinging the pickup over the still-burning ruins. In the ashes of every hut he could see the remains of something like a viewscreen or a nuclear-electric stove or a refrigerator or a sewing machine. He knew how dearly the Kwanns cherished such possessions. That they had destroyed them grieved him. But the Last Hot Time was at hand; the whole world would be destroyed by fire, and then the Gone Ones would return.</p>
			<p>So there were uprisings on the plantations. Paul Sanders had been lucky; his Kwanns had just picked up and left. But he had always gotten along well with the natives, and his plantation house was literally a castle and he had plenty of armament. There had been other planters who had made the double mistake of incurring the enmity of their native labor and of living in unfortified houses. A lot of them weren’t around, any more, and their plantations were gutted ruins.</p>
			<p>And there were plantations on which the natives had destroyed the klooba plants and smashed the crystal which lived symbiotically upon them. They thought the Terrans were using the living crystals to make magic. Not too far off, at that; the properties of Kwannon biocrystals had opened a major breakthrough in subnucleonic physics and initiated half a dozen technologies. New kinds of oomphel. And down in the south, where the spongy and resinous trees were drying in the heat, they were starting forest fires and perishing in them in hecatombs. And to the north, they were swarming into the mountains; building great fires there, too, and attacking the Terran radar and radio beacons.</p>
			<p>Fire was a factor common to all these frenzies. Nothing could happen without magical assistance; the way to bring on the Last Hot Time was People.</p>
			<p>Maybe the ones who died in the frenzies and the swarmings were the lucky ones at that. They wouldn’t live to be crushed by disappointment when the Sky Fire receded as Beta went into the long swing toward apastron. The surviving shoonoon wouldn’t be the lucky ones, that was for sure. The magician-in-public-practice needs only to make one really bad mistake before he is done to some unpleasantly ingenious death by his clientry, and this was going to turn out to be the biggest magico-prophetic blooper in all the long unrecorded history of Kwannon.</p>
			<p>A few minutes after the car turned south from the ruined village, he could see contragravity-vehicles in the air ahead, and then the fields and buildings of the Sanders plantation. A lot more contragravity was grounded in the fallow fields, and there were rows of pneumatic balloon-tents, and field-kitchens, and a whole park of engineering equipment. Work was going on in the klooba-fields, too; about three hundred natives were cutting open the six-foot leafy balls and getting out the biocrystals. Three of the plantation airjeeps, each with a pair of machine guns, were guarding them, but they didn’t seem to be having any trouble. He saw Sanders in another jeep, and had Heshto put the car alongside.</p>
			<p>“How’s it going, Paul?” he asked over his radio. “I see you have some help, now.”</p>
			<p>“Everybody’s from Qualpha’s, and from Darshat’s,” Sanders replied. “The Army had no place to put them, after they burned themselves out.” He laughed happily. “Miles, I’m going to save my whole crop! I thought I was wiped out, this morning.”</p>
			<p>He would have been, if Gonzales hadn’t brought those Kwanns in. The klooba was beginning to wither; if left unharvested, the biocrystals would die along with their hosts and crack into worthlessness. Like all the other planters, Sanders had started no new crystals since the hot weather, and would start none until the worst of the heat was over. He’d need every crystal he could sell to tide him over.</p>
			<p>“The Welfarers’ll make a big forced-labor scandal out of this,” he predicted.</p>
			<p>“Why, such an idea.” Sanders was scandalized. “I’m not forcing them to eat.”</p>
			<p>“The Welfarers don’t think anybody ought to have to work to eat. They think everybody ought to be fed whether they do anything to earn it or not, and if you try to make people earn their food, you’re guilty of economic coercion. And if you’re in business for yourself and want them to work for you, you’re an exploiter and you ought to be eliminated as a class. Haven’t you been trying to run a plantation on this planet, under this Colonial Government, long enough to have found that out, Paul?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Brigadier General Ramón Gonzales had taken over the first⁠—counting down from the landing-stage⁠—floor of the plantation house for his headquarters. His headquarters company had pulled out removable partitions and turned four rooms into one, and moved in enough screens and teleprinters and photoprint machines and computers to have outfitted the main newsroom of <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Planetwide News</i>. The place had the feel of a newsroom⁠—a newsroom after a big story has broken and the ’cast has gone on the air and everybody⁠—in this case about twenty Terran officers and noncoms, half women⁠—standing about watching screens and smoking and thinking about getting a followup ready.</p>
			<p>Gonzales himself was relaxing in Sanders’ business-room, with his belt off and his tunic open. He had black eyes and black hair and mustache, and a slightly equine face that went well with his Old Terran Spanish name. There was another officer with him, considerably younger⁠—Captain Foxx Travis, Major General Maith’s aide.</p>
			<p>“Well, is there anything we can do for you, Miles?” Gonzales asked, after they had exchanged greetings and sat down.</p>
			<p>“Why, could I have your final situation-progress map? And would you be willing to make a statement on audiovisual.” He looked at his watch. “We have about twenty minutes before the ’cast.”</p>
			<p>“You have a map,” Gonzales said, as though he were walking tiptoe from one word to another. “It accurately represents the situation as of the moment, but I’m afraid some minor unavoidable inaccuracies may have crept in while marking the positions and times for the earlier phases of the operation. I teleprinted a copy to <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Planetwide</i> along with the one I sent to Division Headquarters.”</p>
			<p>He understood about that and nodded. Gonzales was zipping up his tunic and putting on his belt and sidearm. That told him, before the brigadier general spoke again, that he was agreeable to the audiovisual appearance and statement. He called the recording studio at <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Planetwide</i> while Gonzales was inspecting himself in the mirror and told them to get set for a recording. It only ran a few minutes; Gonzales, speaking without notes, gave a brief description of the operation.</p>
			<p>“At present,” he concluded, “we have every native village and every plantation and trading-post within two hundred miles of the Sanders plantation occupied. We feel that this swarming has been definitely stopped, but we will continue the occupation for at least the next hundred to two hundred hours. In the meantime, the natives in the occupied villages are being put to work building shelters for themselves against the anticipated storms.”</p>
			<p>“I hadn’t heard about that,” Miles said, as the general returned to his chair and picked up his drink again.</p>
			<p>“Yes. They’ll need something better than these thatched huts when the storms start, and working on them will keep them out of mischief. Standard megaton-kilometer field shelters, earth and log construction. I think they’ll be adequate for anything that happens at periastron.”</p>
			<p>Anything designed to resist the heat, blast and radiation effects of a megaton thermonuclear bomb at a kilometer ought to stand up under what was coming. At least, the periastron effects; there was another angle to it.</p>
			<p>“The Native Welfare Commission isn’t going to take kindly to that. That’s supposed to be their job.”</p>
			<p>“Then why the devil haven’t they done it?” Gonzales demanded angrily. “I’ve viewed every native village in this area by screen, and I haven’t seen one that’s equipped with anything better than those log storage-bins against the stockades.”</p>
			<p>“There was a project to provide shelters for the periastron storms set up ten years ago. They spent one year arguing about how the natives survived storms prior to the Terrans’ arrival here. According to the older natives, they got into those log storage-houses you were mentioning; only about one out of three in any village survived. I could have told them that. Did tell them, repeatedly, on the air. Then, after they decided that shelters were needed, they spent another year hassling over who would be responsible for designing them. Your predecessor here, General Nokami, offered the services of his engineer officers. He was frostily informed that this was a humanitarian and not a military project.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Ramón Gonzales began swearing, then apologized for the interruption. “Then what?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Apology unnecessary. Then they did get a shelter designed, and started teaching some of the students at the native schools how to build them, and then the meteorologists told them it was no good. It was a dugout shelter; the weathermen said there’d be rainfall measured in meters instead of inches and anybody who got caught in one of those dugouts would be drowned like a rat.”</p>
			<p>“Ha, I thought of that one.” Gonzales said. “My shelters are going to be mounded up eight feet above the ground.”</p>
			<p>“What did they do then?” Foxx Travis wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“There the matter rested. As far as I know, nothing has been done on it since.”</p>
			<p>“And you think, with a disgraceful record of non-accomplishment like that, that they’ll protest General Gonzales’ action on purely jurisdictional grounds?” Travis demanded.</p>
			<p>“Not jurisdictional grounds, Foxx. The general’s going at this the wrong way. He actually knows what has to be done and how to do it, and he’s going right ahead and doing it, without holding a dozen conferences and roundtable discussions and giving everybody a fair and equal chance to foul things up for him. You know as well as I do that that’s undemocratic. And what’s worse, he’s making the natives build them themselves, whether they want to or not, and that’s forced labor. That reminds me; has anybody started raising the devil about those Kwanns from Qualpha’s and Darshat’s you brought here and Paul put to work?”</p>
			<p>Gonzales looked at Travis and then said: “Not with me. Not yet, anyhow.”</p>
			<p>“They’ve been at General Maith,” Travis said shortly. After a moment, he added: “General Maith supports General Gonzales completely; that’s for publication. I’m authorized to say so. What else was there to do? They’d burned their villages and all their food stores. They had to be placed somewhere. And why in the name of reason should they sit around in the shade eating Government native-type rations while Paul Sanders has fifty to a hundred thousand sols’ worth of crystals dying on him?”</p>
			<p>“Yes; that’s another thing they’ll scream about. Paul’s making a profit out of it.”</p>
			<p>“Of course he’s making a profit,” Gonzales said. “Why else is he running a plantation? If planters didn’t make profits, who’d grow biocrystals?”</p>
			<p>“The Colonial Government. The same way they built those storm-shelters. But that would be in the public interest, and if the Kwanns weren’t public-spirited enough to do the work, they’d be made to⁠—at about half what planters like Sanders are paying them now. But don’t you realize that profit is sordid and dishonest and selfish? Not at all like drawing a salary-cum-expense-account from the Government.”</p>
			<p>“You’re right, it isn’t,” Gonzales agreed. “People like Paul Sanders have ability. If they don’t, they don’t stay in business. You have ability and people who don’t never forgive you for it. Your very existence is a constant reproach to them.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. And they can’t admit your ability without admitting their own inferiority, so it isn’t ability at all. It’s just dirty underhanded trickery and selfish ruthlessness.” He thought for a moment. “How did Government House find out about these Kwanns here?”</p>
			<p>“The Welfare Commission had people out while I was still setting up headquarters,” Gonzales said. “That was about oh-seven-hundred.”</p>
			<p>“This isn’t for publication?” Travis asked. “Well, they know, but they can’t prove, that our given reason for moving in here in force is false. Of course, we can’t change our story now; that’s why the situation-progress map that was prepared for publication is incorrect as to the earlier phases. They do not know that it was you who gave us our first warning; they ascribe that to Sanders. And they are claiming that there never was any swarming; according to them, Sanders’ natives are striking for better pay and conditions, and Sanders got General Maith to use troops to break the strike. I wish we could give you credit for putting us onto this, but it’s too late now.”</p>
			<p>He nodded. The story was that a battalion of infantry had been sent in to rescue a small detail under attack by natives, and that more troops had been sent in to reinforce them, until the whole of Gonzales’ brigade had been committed.</p>
			<p>“That wasted an hour, at the start,” Gonzales said. “We lost two native villages burned, and about two dozen casualties, because we couldn’t get our full strength in soon enough.”</p>
			<p>“You’d have lost more than that if Maith had told the governor general the truth and requested orders to act. There’d be a hundred villages and a dozen plantations and trading posts burning, now, and Lord knows how many dead, and the governor general would still be arguing about whether he was justified in ordering troop-action.” He mentioned several other occasions when something like that had happened. “You can’t tell that kind of people the truth. They won’t believe it. It doesn’t agree with their preconceptions.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Foxx Travis nodded. “I take it we are still talking for nonpublication?” When Miles nodded, he continued: “This whole situation is baffling, Miles. It seems that the government here knew all about the weather conditions they could expect at periastron, and had made plans for them. Some of them excellent plans, too, but all based on the presumption that the natives would cooperate or at least not obstruct. You see what the situation actually is. It should be obvious to everybody that the behavior of these natives is nullifying everything the civil government is trying to do to ensure the survival of the Terran colonists, the production of Terran-type food without which we would all starve, the biocrystal plantations without which the Colony would perish, and even the natives themselves. Yet the Civil Government will not act to stop these native frenzies and swarmings which endanger everything and everybody here, and when the Army attempts to act, we must use every sort of shabby subterfuge and deceit or the Civil Government will prevent us. What ails these people?”</p>
			<p>“You have the whole history of the Colony against you, Foxx,” he said. “You know, there never was any Chartered Kwannon Company set up to exploit the resources of the planet. At first, nobody realized that there were any resources worth exploiting. This planet was just a scientific curiosity; it was and is still the only planet of a binary system with a native population of sapient beings. The first people who came here were scientists, mostly sociographers and para-anthropologists. And most of them came from the University of Adelaide.”</p>
			<p>Travis nodded. Adelaide had a Federation-wide reputation for left-wing neo-Marxist “liberalism.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that established the political and social orientation of the Colonial Government, right at the start, when study of the natives was the only business of the Colony. You know how these ideological cliques form in a government⁠—or any other organization. Subordinates are always chosen for their agreement with the views of their superiors, and the extremists always get to the top and shove the moderates under or out. Well, the Native Affairs Administration became the tail that wagged the Government dog, and the Native Welfare Commission is the big muscle in the tail.”</p>
			<p>His parents hadn’t been of the left-wing Adelaide clique. His mother had been a biochemist; his father a roving news correspondent who had drifted into trading with the natives and made a fortune in keffa-gum before the chemists on Terra had found out how to synthesize hopkinsine.</p>
			<p>“When the biocrystals were discovered and the plantations started, the Government attitude was set. Biocrystal culture is just sordid money grubbing. The real business of the Colony is to promote the betterment of the natives, as defined in University of Adelaide terms. That’s to say, convert them into ersatz Terrans. You know why General Maith ordered these shoonoon rounded up?”</p>
			<p>Travis made a face. “Governor general Kovac insisted on it; General Maith thought that a few minor concessions would help him on his main objective, which was keeping a swarming from starting out here.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. The Commissioner of Native Welfare wanted that done, mainly at the urging of the Director of Economic, Educational and Technical Assistance. The <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr> crowd don’t like shoonoon. They have been trying, ever since their agency was set up, to undermine and destroy their influence with the natives. This looked like a good chance to get rid of some of them.”</p>
			<p>Travis nodded. “Yes. And as soon as the disturbances in Bluelake started, the Constabulary started rounding them up there, too, and at the evacuee cantonments. They got about fifty of them, mostly from the cantonments east of the city⁠—the natives brought in from the flooded tidewater area. They just dumped the lot of them onto us. We have them penned up in a lorry-hangar on the military reservation now.” He turned to Gonzales. “How many do you think you’ll gather up out here, general?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I’d say about a hundred and fifty, when we have them all.”</p>
			<p>Travis groaned. “We can’t keep all of them in that hangar, and we don’t have anywhere else⁠—”</p>
			<p>Sometimes a new idea sneaked up on Miles, rubbing against him and purring like a cat. Sometimes one hit him like a sledgehammer. This one just seemed to grow inside him.</p>
			<p>“Foxx, you know I have the top three floors of the Suzikami Building; about five hundred hours ago, I leased the fourth and fifth floors, directly below. I haven’t done anything with them, yet; they’re just as they were when Trans-Space Imports moved out. There are ample water, light, power, air-conditioning and toilet facilities, and they can be sealed off completely from the rest of the building. If General Maith’s agreeable, I’ll take his shoonoon off his hands.”</p>
			<p>“What in blazes will you do with them?”</p>
			<p>“Try a little experiment in psychological warfare. At minimum, we may get a little better insight into why these natives think the Last Hot Time is coming. At best, we may be able to stop the whole thing and get them quieted down again.”</p>
			<p>“Even the minimum’s worth trying for,” Travis said. “What do you have in mind, Miles? I mean, what procedure?”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m not quite sure, yet.” That was a lie; he was very sure. He didn’t think it was quite time to be specific, though. “I’ll have to size up my material a little, before I decide on what to do with it. Whatever happens, it won’t hurt the shoonoon, and it won’t make any more trouble than arresting them has made already. I’m sure we can learn something from them, at least.”</p>
			<p>Travis nodded. “General Maith is very much impressed with your grasp of native psychology,” he said. “What happened out here this morning was exactly as you predicted. Whatever my recommendation’s worth, you have it. Can you trust your native driver to take your car back to Bluelake alone?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
			<p>“Then suppose you ride in with me in my car. We’ll talk about it on the way in, and go see General Maith at once.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Bluelake was peaceful as they flew in over it, but it was an uneasy peace. They began running into military contragravity twenty miles beyond the open farmlands⁠—they were the chlorophyll green of Terran vegetation⁠—and the natives at work in the fields were being watched by more military and police vehicles. The carniculture plants, where Terran-type animal tissue was grown in nutrient-vats, were even more heavily guarded, and the native city was being patroled from above and the streets were empty, even of the hordes of native children who usually played in them.</p>
			<p>The Terran city had no streets. Its dwellers moved about on contragravity, and tall buildings rose, singly or in clumps, among the landing-staged residences and the green transplanted trees. There was a triple wire fence around it, the inner one masked by vines and the middle one electrified, with warning lights on. Even a government dedicated to the betterment of the natives and unwilling to order military action against them was, it appeared, unwilling to take too many chances.</p>
			<p>Major General Denis Maith, the Federation Army commander on Kwannon, was considerably more than willing to find a temporary home for his witch doctors, now numbering close to two hundred. He did insist that they be kept under military guard, and on assigning his aide, Captain Travis, to cooperate on the project. Beyond that, he gave Miles a free hand.</p>
			<p>Miles and Travis got very little rest in the next ten hours. A half-company of engineer troops was also kept busy, as were a number of <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Kwannon Planetwide News</i> technicians and some Terran and native mechanics borrowed from different private business concerns in the city. Even the most guarded hints of what he had in mind were enough to get this last cooperation; he had been running a news-service in Bluelake long enough to have the confidence of the business people.</p>
			<p>He tried, as far as possible, to keep any intimation of what was going on from Government House. That, unfortunately, hadn’t been far enough. He found that out when General Maith was on his screen, in the middle of the work on the fourth and fifth floors of the Suzikami Building.</p>
			<p>“The governor general just screened me,” Maith said. “He’s in a tizzy about our shoonoon. Claims that keeping them in the Suzikami Building will endanger the whole Terran city.”</p>
			<p>“Is that the best he can do? Well, that’s rubbish, and he knows it. There are less than two hundred of them, I have them on the fifth floor, twenty stories above the ground, and the floor’s completely sealed off from the floor below. They can’t get out, and I have tanks of sleep-gas all over the place which can be opened either individually or all together from a switch on the fourth floor, where your sepoys are quartered.”</p>
			<p>“I know, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert; I screen-viewed the whole installation. I’ve seen regular maximum-security prisons that would be easier to get out of.”</p>
			<p>“Governor general Kovac is not objecting personally. He has been pressured into it by this Native Welfare government-within-the-Government. They don’t know what I’m doing with those shoonoon, but whatever it is, they’re afraid of it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, for the present,” Maith said, “I think I’m holding them off. The Civil Government doesn’t want the responsibility of keeping them in custody, I refused to assume responsibility for them if they were kept anywhere else, and Kovac simply won’t consider releasing them, so that leaves things as they are. I did have to make one compromise, though.” That didn’t sound good. It sounded less so when Maith continued: “They insisted on having one of their people at the Suzikami Building as an observer. I had to grant that.”</p>
			<p>“That’s going to mean trouble.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I shouldn’t think so. This observer will observe, and nothing else. She will take no part in anything you’re doing, will voice no objections, and will not interrupt anything you are saying to the shoonoon. I was quite firm on that, and the governor general agreed completely.”</p>
			<p>“She?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. A Miss Edith Shaw; do you know anything about her?”</p>
			<p>“I’ve met her a few times; cocktail parties and so on.” She was young enough, and new enough to Kwannon, not to have a completely indurated mind. On the other hand, she was <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr> which was bad, and had a master’s in sociography from Adelaide, which was worse. “When can I look for her?”</p>
			<p>“Well, the governor general’s going to screen me and find out when you’ll have the shoonoon on hand.”</p>
			<p>Doesn’t want to talk to me at all, Miles thought. Afraid he might say something and get quoted.</p>
			<p>“For your information, they’ll be here inside an hour. They will have to eat, and they’re all tired and sleepy. I should say ’bout oh-eight-hundred. Oh, and will you tell the governor general to tell Miss Shaw to bring an overnight kit with her. She’s going to need it.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He was up at 0400, just a little after Beta-rise. He might be a civilian big-wheel in an Army psychological warfare project, but he still had four newscasts a day to produce. He spent a couple of hours checking the 0600 ’cast and briefing Harry Walsh for the indeterminate period in which he would be acting chief editor and producer. At 0700, Foxx Travis put in an appearance. They went down to the fourth floor, to the little room they had fitted out as command-post, control room and office for Operation Shoonoo.</p>
			<p>There was a rectangular black traveling-case, initialed <abbr epub:type="z3998:personal-name">E. S.</abbr>, beside the open office door. Travis nodded at it, and they grinned at one another; she’d come early, possibly hoping to catch them hiding something they didn’t want her to see. Entering the office quietly, they found her seated facing the big viewscreen, smoking and watching a couple of enlisted men of the First Kwannon Native Infantry at work in another room where the pickup was. There were close to a dozen lipstick-tinted cigarette butts in the ashtray beside her. Her private face wasn’t particularly happy. Maybe she was being earnest and concerned about the betterment of the underpriviledged, or the satanic maneuvers of the selfish planters.</p>
			<p>Then she realized that somebody had entered; with a slight start, she turned, then rose. She was about the height of Foxx Travis, a few inches shorter than Miles, and slender. Light blond; green suit costume. She ditched her private face and got on her public one, a pleasant and deferential smile, with a trace of uncertainty behind it. Miles introduced Travis, and they sat down again facing the screen.</p>
			<p>It gave a view, from one of the long sides and near the ceiling, of a big room. In the center, a number of seats⁠—the drum-shaped cushions the natives had adopted in place of the seats carved from sections of tree trunk that they had been using when the Terrans had come to Kwannon⁠—were arranged in a semicircle, one in the middle slightly in advance of the others. Facing them were three armchairs, a remote-control box beside one and another Kwann cushion behind and between the other two. There was a large globe of Kwannon, and on the wall behind the chairs an array of viewscreens.</p>
			<p>“There’ll be an interpreter, a native Army sergeant, between you and Captain Travis,” he said. “I don’t know how good you are with native languages, Miss Shaw; the captain is not very fluent.”</p>
			<p>“Cushions for them, I see, and chairs for the lordly Terrans,” she commented. “Never miss a chance to rub our superiority in, do you?”</p>
			<p>“I never deliberately force them to adopt our ways,” he replied. “Our chairs are as uncomfortable for them as their low seats are for us. Difference, you know, doesn’t mean inferiority or superiority. It just means difference.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what are you trying to do, here?”</p>
			<p>“I’m trying to find out a little more about the psychology back of these frenzies and swarmings.”</p>
			<p>“It hasn’t occurred to you to look for them in the economic wrongs these people are suffering at the hands of the planters and traders, I suppose.”</p>
			<p>“So they’re committing suicide, and that’s all you can call these swarmings, and the fire-frenzies in the south, from economic motives,” Travis said. “How does one better oneself economically by dying?”</p>
			<p>She ignored the question, which was easier than trying to answer it.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“And why are you bothering to talk to these witch doctors? They aren’t representative of the native people. They’re a lot of cynical charlatans, with a vested interest in ignorance and superstition⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Miss Shaw, for the past eight centuries, earnest souls have been bewailing the fact that progress in the social sciences has always lagged behind progress in the physical sciences. I would suggest that the explanation might be in difference of approach. The physical scientist works <em>with</em> physical forces, even when he is trying, as in the case of contragravity, to nullify them. The social scientist works <em>against</em> social forces.”</p>
			<p>“And the result’s usually a miserable failure, even on the physical-accomplishment level,” Foxx Travis added. “This storm shelter project that was set up ten years ago and got nowhere, for instance. Ramón Gonzales set up a shelter project of his own seventy-five hours ago, and he’s half through with it now.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, by forced labor!”</p>
			<p>“Field surgery’s brutal, too, especially when the anaesthetics run out. It’s better than letting your wounded die, though.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we were talking about these shoonoon. They are a force among the natives; that can’t be denied. So, since we want to influence the natives, why not use them?”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert, these shoonoon are blocking everything we are trying to do for the natives. If you use them for propaganda work in the villages, you will only increase their prestige and make it that much harder for us to better the natives’ condition, both economically and culturally⁠—”</p>
			<p>“That’s it, Miles,” Travis said. “She isn’t interested in facts about specific humanoid people on Kwannon. She has a lot of high-order abstractions she got in a classroom at Adelaide on Terra.”</p>
			<p>“No. Her idea of bettering the natives’ condition is to rope in a lot of young Kwanns, put them in Government schools, overload them with information they aren’t prepared to digest, teach them to despise their own people, and then send them out to the villages, where they behave with such insufferable arrogance that the wonder is that so few of them stop an arrow or a charge of buckshot, instead of so many. And when that happens, as it does occasionally, Welfare says they’re murdered at the instigation of the shoonoon.”</p>
			<p>“You know, Miss Shaw, this isn’t just the roughneck’s scorn for the egghead,” Travis said. “Miles went to school on Terra, and majored in extraterrestrial sociography, and got a master’s, just like you did. At Montevideo,” he added. “And he spent two more years traveling on a Paula von Schlicten Fellowship.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Edith Shaw didn’t say anything. She even tried desperately not to look impressed. It occurred to him that he’d never mentioned that fellowship to Travis. Army Intelligence must have a pretty good dossier on him. Before anybody could say anything further, a Terran captain and a native sergeant of the First <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.N.I.</abbr> came in. In the screen, the four sepoys who had been fussing around straightening things picked up auto-carbines and posted themselves two on either side of a door across from the pickup, taking positions that would permit them to fire into whatever came through without hitting each other.</p>
			<p>What came through was one hundred and eighty-four shoonoon. Some wore robes of loose gauze strips, and some wore fire-dance cloaks of red and yellow and orange ribbons. Many were almost completely naked, but they were all amulet-ed to the teeth. There must have been a couple of miles of brass and bright-alloy wire among them, and half a ton of bright scrap-metal, and the skulls, bones, claws, teeth, tails and other components of most of the native fauna. They debouched into the big room, stopped, and stood looking around them. A native sergeant and a couple more sepoys followed. They got the shoonoon over to the semicircle of cushions, having to chase a couple of them away from the single seat at front and center, and induced them to sit down.</p>
			<p>The native sergeant in the little room said something under his breath; the captain laughed. Edith Shaw gaped for an instant and said, “<i xml:lang="und">Muggawsh!</i>” Travis simply remarked that he’d be damned.</p>
			<p>“They do look kind of unusual, don’t they?” Miles said. “I wouldn’t doubt that this is the biggest assemblage of shoonoon in history. They aren’t exactly a gregarious lot.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe this is the beginning of a new era. First meeting of the Kwannon Thaumaturgical Society.”</p>
			<p>A couple more <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.N.I.</abbr> privates came in with serving-tables on contragravity floats and began passing bowls of a frozen native-food delicacy of which all Kwanns had become passionately fond since its introduction by the Terrans. He let them finish, and then, after they had been relieved of the empty bowls, he nodded to the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.N.I.</abbr> sergeant, who opened a door on the left. They all went through into the room they had been seeing in the screen. There was a stir when the shoonoon saw him, and he heard his name, in its usual native mispronunciation, repeated back and forth.</p>
			<p>“You all know me,” he said, after they were seated. “Have I ever been an enemy to you or to the People?”</p>
			<p>“No,” one of them said. “He speaks for us to the other Terrans. When we are wronged, he tries to get the wrongs righted. In times of famine he has spoken of our troubles, and gifts of food have come while the Government argued about what to do.”</p>
			<p>He wished he could see Edith Shaw’s face.</p>
			<p>“There was a sickness in our village, and my magic could not cure it,” another said. “Mailsh Heelbare gave me oomphel to cure it, and told me how to use it. He did this privately, so that I would not be made to look small to the people of the village.”</p>
			<p>And that had infuriated <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr>; it was a question whether unofficial help to the natives or support of the prestige of a shoonoo had angered them more.</p>
			<p>“His father was a trader; he gave good oomphel, and did not cheat. Mailsh Heelbare grew up among us; he took the Manhood Test with the boys of the village,” another oldster said. “He listened with respect to the grandfather-stories. No, Mailsh Heelbare is not our enemy. He is our friend.”</p>
			<p>“And so I will prove myself now,” he told them. “The Government is angry with the People, but I will try to take their anger away, and in the meantime I am permitted to come here and talk with you. Here is a chief of soldiers, and one of the Government people, and your words will be heard by the oomphel machine that remembers and repeats, for the Governor and the Great Soldier Chief.”</p>
			<p>They all brightened. To make a voice recording was a wonderful honor. Then one of them said:</p>
			<p>“But what good will that do now? The Last Hot Time is here. Let us be permitted to return to our villages, where our people need us.”</p>
			<p>“It is of that that I wish to speak. But first of all, I must hear your words, and know what is in your minds. Who is the eldest among you? Let him come forth and sit in the front, where I may speak with him.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Then he relaxed while they argued in respectfully subdued voices. Finally one decrepit oldster, wearing a cloak of yellow ribbons and carrying a highly obscene and ineffably sacred wooden image, was brought forward and installed on the front-and-center cushion. He’d come from some village to the west that hadn’t gotten the word of the swarming; Gonzales’ men had snagged him while he was making crop-fertility magic.</p>
			<p>Miles showed him the respect due his advanced age and obviously great magical powers, displaying, as he did, an understanding of the regalia.</p>
			<p>“I have indeed lived long,” the old shoonoo replied. “I saw the Hot Time before; I was a child of so high.” He measured about two and a half feet off the floor; that would make him ninety-five or thereabouts. “I remember it.”</p>
			<p>“Speak to us, then. Tell us of the Gone Ones, and of the Sky Fire, and of the Last Hot Time. Speak as though you alone knew these things, and as though you were teaching me.”</p>
			<p>Delighted, the oldster whooshed a couple of times to clear his outlets and began:</p>
			<p>“In the long-ago time, there was only the Great Spirit. The Great Spirit made the World, and he made the People. In that time, there were no more People in the World than would be in one village, now. The Gone Ones dwelt among them, and spoke to them as I speak to you. Then, as more People were born, and died and went to join the Gone Ones, the Gone Ones became many, and they went away and build a place for themselves, and built the Sky Fire around it, and in the Place of the Gone Ones, at the middle of the Sky Fire, it is cool. From their place in the Sky Fire, the Gone Ones send wisdom to the people in dreams.</p>
			<p>“The Sky Fire passes across the sky, from east to west, as the Always-Same does, but it is farther away than the Always-Same, because sometimes the Always Same passes in front of it, but the Sky Fire never passes in front of the Always-Same. None of the grandfather-stories, not even the oldest, tell of a time when this happened.</p>
			<p>“Sometimes the Sky Fire is big and bright; that is when the Gone Ones feast and dance. Sometimes it is smaller and dimmer; then the Gone Ones rest and sleep. Sometimes it is close, and there is a Hot Time; sometimes it goes far away, and then there is a Cool Time.</p>
			<p>“Now, the Last Hot Time has come. The Sky Fire will come closer and closer, and it will pass the Always-Same, and then it will burn up the World. Then will be a new World, and the Gone Ones will return, and the People will be given new bodies. When this happens, the Sky Fire will go out, and the Gone Ones will live in the World again with the People; the Gone Ones will make great magic and teach wisdom as I teach to you, and will no longer have to send dreams. In that time the crops will grow without planting or tending or the work of women; in that time, the game will come into the villages to be killed in the gathering-places. There will be no more hunger and no more hard work, and no more of the People will die or be slain. And that time is now here,” he finished. “All the People know this.”</p>
			<p>“Tell me, Grandfather; how is this known? There have been many Hot Times before. Why should this one be the Last Hot Time?”</p>
			<p>“The Terrans have come, and brought oomphel into the World,” the old shoonoo said. “It is a sign.”</p>
			<p>“It was not prophesied beforetime. None of the People had prophesies of the coming of the Terrans. I ask you, who were the father of children and the grandfather of children’s children when the Terrans came; was there any such prophesy?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The old shoonoo was silent, turning his pornographic icon in his hands and looked at it.</p>
			<p>“No,” he admitted, at length. “Before the Terrans came, there were no prophesies among the People of their coming. Afterward, of course, there were many such prophesies, but there were none before.”</p>
			<p>“That is strange. When a happening is a sign of something to come, it is prophesied beforetime.” He left that seed of doubt alone to grow, and continued: “Now, Grandfather, speak to us about what the People believe concerning the Terrans.”</p>
			<p>“The Terrans came to the World when my eldest daughter bore her first child,” the old shoonoo said. “They came in great round ships, such as come often now, but which had never before been seen. They said that they came from another world like the World of People, but so far away that even the Sky Fire could not be seen from it. They still say this, and many of the People believe it, but it is not real.</p>
			<p>“At first, it was thought that the Terrans were great shoonoon who made powerful magic, but this is not real either. The Terrans have no magic and no wisdom of their own. All they have is the oomphel, and the oomphel works magic for them and teaches them their wisdom. Even in the schools which the Terrans have made for the People, it is the oomphel which teaches.” He went on to describe, not too incorrectly, the reading-screens and viewscreens and audiovisual equipment. “Nor do the Terrans make the oomphel, as they say. The oomphel makes more oomphel for them.”</p>
			<p>“Then where did the Terrans get the first oomphel?”</p>
			<p>“They stole it from the Gone Ones,” the old shoonoo replied. “The Gone Ones make it in their place in the middle of the Sky Fire, for themselves and to give to the People when they return. The Terrans stole it from them. For this reason, there is much hatred of the Terrans among the People. The Terrans live in the Dark Place, under the World, where the Sky Fire and the Always-Same go when they are not in the sky. It is there that the Terrans get the oomphel from the Gone Ones, and now they have come to the World, and they are using oomphel to hold back the Sky-Fire and keep it beyond the Always-Same so that the Last Hot Time will not come and the Gone Ones will not return. For this reason, too, there is much hatred of the Terrans among the People.”</p>
			<p>“Grandfather, if this were real there would be good reason for such hatred, and I would be ashamed for what my people had done and were doing. But it is not real.” He had to rise and hold up his hands to quell the indignant outcry “Have any of you known me to tell not-real things and try to make the People act as though they were real? Then trust me in this. I will show you real things, which you will all see, and I will give you great secrets, which it is now time for you to have and use for the good of the People. Even the greatest secret,” he added.</p>
			<p>There was a pause of a few seconds. Then they burst out, in a hundred and eighty-four⁠—no, three hundred and sixty eight⁠—voices:</p>
			<p>
				<em>“The Oomphel Secret, Mailsh Heelbare?”</em>
			</p>
			<p>He nodded slowly. “Yes. The Oomphel Secret will be given.”</p>
			<p>He leaned back and relaxed again while they were getting over the excitement. Foxx Travis looked at him apprehensively.</p>
			<p>“Rushing things, aren’t you? What are you going to tell them?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, a big pack of lies, I suppose,” Edith Shaw said scornfully.</p>
			<p>Behind her and Travis, the native noncom interpreter was muttering something in his own language that translated roughly as: “This better be good!”</p>
			<p>The shoonoon had quieted, now, and were waiting breathlessly.</p>
			<p>“But if the Oomphel Secret is given, what will become of the shoonoon?” he asked. “You, yourselves, say that we Terrans have no need for magic, because the oomphel works magic for us. This is real. If the People get the Oomphel Secret, how much need will they have for you shoonoon?”</p>
			<p>Evidently that hadn’t occurred to them before. There was a brief flurry of whispered⁠—whooshed, rather⁠—conversation, and then they were silent again. The eldest shoonoo said:</p>
			<p>“We trust you, Mailsh Heelbare. You will do what is best for the People, and you will not let us be thrown out like broken pots, either.”</p>
			<p>“No, I will not,” he promised. “The Oomphel Secret will be given to you shoonoon.” He thought for a moment of Foxx Travis’ joking remark about the Kwannon Thaumaturgical Society. “You have been jealous of one another, each keeping his own secrets,” he said. “This must be put away. You will all receive the Oomphel Secret equally, for the good of all the People. You must all swear brotherhood, one with another, and later if any other shoonoo comes to you for the secret, you must swear brotherhood with him and teach it to him. Do you agree to this?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The eldest shoonoo rose to his feet, begged leave, and then led the others to the rear of the room, where they went into a huddle. They didn’t stay huddled long; inside of ten minutes they came back and took their seats.</p>
			<p>“We are agreed, Mailsh Heelbare,” the spokesman said.</p>
			<p>Edith Shaw was impressed, more than by anything else she had seen. “Well, that was a quick decision!” she whispered.</p>
			<p>“You have done well, Grandfathers. You will not be thrown out by the People like broken pots; you will be greater among them than ever. I will show you how this will be.</p>
			<p>“But first, I must speak around the Oomphel Secret.” He groped briefly for a comprehensible analogy, and thought of a native vegetable, layered like an onion, with a hard kernel in the middle. “The Oomphel Secret is like a fooshkoot. There are many lesser secrets around it, each of which must be peeled off like the skins of a fooshkoot and eaten. Then you will find the nut in the middle.”</p>
			<p>“But the nut of the fooshkoot is bitter,” somebody said.</p>
			<p>He nodded, slowly and solemnly. “The nut of the fooshkoot is bitter,” he agreed.</p>
			<p>They looked at one another, disquieted by his words. Before anybody could comment, he was continuing:</p>
			<p>“Before this secret is given, there are things to be learned. You would not understand it if I gave it to you now. You believe many not-real things which must be chased out of your minds, otherwise they would spoil your understanding.”</p>
			<p>That was verbatim what they told adolescents before giving them the Manhood Secret. Some of them huffed a little; most of them laughed. Then one called out: “Speak on, Grandfather of Grandfathers,” and they all laughed. That was fine, it had been about time for teacher to crack his little joke. Now he became serious again.</p>
			<p>“The first of these not-real things you must chase from your mind is this which you believe about the home of the Terrans. It is not real that they come from the Dark Place under the World. There is no Dark Place under the World.”</p>
			<p>Bedlam for a few seconds; that was a pretty stiff jolt. No Dark Place; who ever heard of such a thing? The eldest shoonoo rose, cradling his graven image in his arms, and the noise quieted.</p>
			<p>“Mailsh Heelbare, if there is no Dark Place where do the Sky Fire and the Always-Same go when they are not in the sky?”</p>
			<p>“They never leave the sky; the World is round, and there is sky everywhere around it.”</p>
			<p>They knew that, or had at least heard it, since the Terrans had come. They just couldn’t believe it. It was against common sense. The oldest shoonoo said as much, and more:</p>
			<p>“These young ones who have gone to the Terran schools have come to the villages with such tales, but who listens to them? They show disrespect for the chiefs and the elders, and even for the shoonoon. They mock at the Grandfather-stories. They say men should do women’s work and women do no work at all. They break taboos, and cause trouble. They are fools.”</p>
			<p>“Am I a fool, Grandfather? Do I mock at the old stories, or show disrespect to elders and shoonoon? Yet I, Mailsh Heelbare, tell you this. The World is indeed round, and I will show you.”</p>
			<p>The shoonoo looked contemptuously at the globe. “I have seen those things,” he said. “That is not the World; that is only a make-like.” He held up his phallic woodcarving. “I could say that this is a make-like of the World, but that would not make it so.”</p>
			<p>“I will show you for real. We will all go in a ship.” He looked at his watch. “The Sky Fire is about to set. We will follow it all around the world to the west, and come back here from the east, and the Sky Fire will still be setting when we return. If I show you that, will you believe me?”</p>
			<p>“If you show us for real, and it is not a trick, we will have to believe you.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>When they emerged from the escalators, Alpha was just touching the western horizon, and Beta was a little past zenith. The ship was moored on contragravity beside the landing stage, her gangplank run out. The shoonoon, who had gone up ahead, had all stopped short and were staring at her; then they began gabbling among themselves, overcome by the wonder of being about to board such a monster and ride on her. She was the biggest ship any of them had ever seen. Maybe a few of them had been on small freighters; many of them had never been off the ground. They didn’t look or act like cynical charlatans or implacable enemies of progress and enlightenment. They were more like a lot of schoolboys whose teacher is taking them on a surprise outing.</p>
			<p>“Bet this’ll be the biggest day in their lives,” Travis said.</p>
			<p>“Oh, sure. This’ll be a grandfather-story ten generations from now.”</p>
			<p>“I can’t get over the way they made up their minds, down there,” Edith Shaw was saying. “Why, they just went and talked for a few minutes and came back with a decision.”</p>
			<p>They hadn’t any organization, or any place to maintain on an organizational pecking-order. Nobody was obliged to attack anybody else’s proposition in order to keep up his own status. He thought of the Colonial Government taking ten years not to build those storm-shelters.</p>
			<p>Foxx Travis was commenting on the ship, now:</p>
			<p>“I never saw that ship before; didn’t know there was anything like that on the planet. Why, you could lift a whole regiment, with supplies and equipment⁠—”</p>
			<p>“She’s been laid up for the last five years, since the heat and the native troubles stopped the tourist business here. She’s the old <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Hesperus</i>. Excursion craft. This sun-chasing trip we’re going to make used to be a must for tourists here.”</p>
			<p>“I thought she was something like that, with all the glassed observation deck forward. Who’s the owner?”</p>
			<p>“Kwannon Air Transport, <abbr>Ltd.</abbr> I told them what I needed her for, and they made her available and furnished officers and crew and provisions for the trip. They were working to put her in commission while we were fitting up the fourth and fifth floors, downstairs.”</p>
			<p>“You just asked for that ship, and they just let you have it?” Edith Shaw was incredulous and shocked. They wouldn’t have done that for the Government.</p>
			<p>“They want to see these native troubles stopped, too. Bad for business. You know; selfish profit-move. That’s another social force it’s a good idea to work with instead of against.”</p>
			<p>The shoonoon were getting aboard, now, shepherded by the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.N.I.</abbr> officer and a couple of his men and some of the ship’s crew. A couple of sepoys were lugging the big globe that had been brought up from below after them. Everybody assembled on the forward top observation deck, and Miles called for attention and, finally, got it. He pointed out the three viewscreens mounted below the bridge, amidships. One on the left, was tuned to a pickup on the top of the Air Terminal tower, where the Terran city, the military reservation and the spaceport met. It showed the view to the west, with Alpha on the horizon. The one on the right, from the same point, gave a view in the opposite direction, to the east. The middle screen presented a magnified view of the navigational globe on the bridge.</p>
			<p>Viewscreens were no novelty to the shoonoon. They were a very familiar type of oomphel. He didn’t even need to do more than tell them that the little spot of light on the globe would show the position of the ship. When he was sure that they understood that they could see what was happening in Bluelake while they were away, he called the bridge and ordered Up Ship, telling the officer on duty to hold her at five thousand feet.</p>
			<p>The ship rose slowly, turning toward the setting M-giant. Somebody called attention that the views in the screens weren’t changing. Somebody else said:</p>
			<p>“Of course not. What we see for real changes because the ship is moving. What we see in the screens is what the oomphel on the big building sees, and it does not move. That is for real as the oomphel sees it.”</p>
			<p>“Nice going,” Edith said. “Your class has just discovered relativity.” Travis was looking at the eastward viewscreen. He stepped over beside Miles and lowered his voice.</p>
			<p>“Trouble over there to the east of town. Big swarm of combat contragravity working on something on the ground. And something’s on fire, too.”</p>
			<p>“I see it.”</p>
			<p>“That’s where those evacuees are camped. Why in blazes they had to bring them here to Bluelake⁠—”</p>
			<p>That had been <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr>, too. When the solar tides had gotten high enough to flood the coastal area, the natives who had been evacuated from the district had been brought here because the Native Education people wanted them exposed to urban influences. About half of the shoonoon who had been rounded up locally had come in from the tide-inundated area.</p>
			<p>“Parked right in the middle of the Terran-type food production area,” Travis was continuing.</p>
			<p>That was worrying him. Maybe he wasn’t used to planets where the biochemistry wasn’t Terra-type and a Terran would be poisoned or, at best, starve to death, on the local food; maybe, as a soldier he knew how fragile even the best logistics system can be. It was something to worry about. Travis excused himself and went off in the direction of the bridge. Going to call <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.Q.</abbr> and find out what was happening.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Excitement among the shoonoon; they had spotted the ship on which they were riding in the westward screen. They watched it until it had vanished from “sight of the seeing-oomphel,” and by then were over the upland forests from whence they had been brought to Bluelake. Now and then one of them would identify his own village, and that would start more excitement.</p>
			<p>Three infantry troop-carriers and a squadron of air cavalry were rushing past the eastward pickup in the right hand screen; another fire had started in the trouble area.</p>
			<p>The crowd that had gathered around the globe that had been brought aboard began calling for Mailsh Heelbare to show them how they would go around the world and what countries they would pass over. Edith accompanied him and listened while he talked to them. She was bubbling with happy excitement, now. It had just dawned on her that shoonoon were fun.</p>
			<p>None of them had ever seen the mountains along the western side of the continent except from a great distance. Now they were passing over them; the ship had to gain altitude and even then make a detour around one snow-capped peak. The whole hundred and eighty-four rushed to the starboard side to watch it as they passed. The ocean, half an hour later, started a rush forward. The score or so of them from the Tidewater knew what an ocean was, but none of them had known that there was another one to the west. Miles’ view of the education program of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr>, never bright at best, became even dimmer. <q>The young men who have gone to the Terran school⁠ ⁠… who listens to them? They are fools.</q></p>
			<p>There were a few islands off the coast; the shoonoon identified them on the screen globe, and on the one on deck. Some of them wanted to know why there wasn’t a spot of light on this globe, too. It didn’t have the oomphel inside to do that; that was a satisfactory explanation. Edith started to explain about the orbital beacon-stations off-planet and the radio beams, and then stopped.</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry; I’m not supposed to say anything to them,” she apologized.</p>
			<p>“Oh, that’s all right. I wouldn’t go into all that, though. We don’t want to overload them.”</p>
			<p>She asked permission, a little later, to explain why the triangle tip of the arctic continent, which had begun to edge into sight on the screen globe, couldn’t be seen from the ship. When he told her to go ahead, she got a platinum half-sol piece from her purse, held it on the globe from the classroom and explained about the curvature and told them they could see nothing farther away than the circle the coin covered. It was beginning to look as though the psychological-warfare experiment might show another, unexpected, success.</p>
			<p>There was nothing, after the islands passed, but a lot of empty water. The shoonoon were getting hungry, but they refused to go below to eat. They were afraid they might miss something. So their dinner was brought up on deck for them. Miles and Travis and Edith went to the officers’ dining room back of the bridge. Edith, by now, was even more excited than the shoonoon.</p>
			<p>“They’re so anxious to learn!” She was having trouble adjusting to that; that was dead against <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr> doctrine. “But why wouldn’t they listen to the teachers we sent to the villages?”</p>
			<p>“You heard old Shatresh⁠—the fellow with the pornographic sculpture and the yellow robe. These young twerps act like fools, and sensible people don’t pay any attention to fools. What’s more, they’ve been sent out indoctrinated with the idea that shoonoon are a lot of lying old fakes, and the shoonoon resent that. You know, they’re not lying old fakes. Within their limitations, they are honest and ethical professional people.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, come, now! I know, I think they’re sort of wonderful, but let’s don’t give them too much credit.”</p>
			<p>“I’m not. You’re doing that.”</p>
			<p>“<em>Huh?</em>” She looked at him in amazement. “Me?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Yes, you. You know better than to believe in magic, so you expect them to know better, too. Well, they don’t. You know that under the macroscopic world-of-the senses there exists a complex of biological, chemical and physical phenomena down to the subnucleonic level. They realize that there must be something beyond what they can see and handle, but they think it’s magic. Well, as a race, so did we until only a few centuries pre-atomic. These people are still lower Neolithic, a hunting people who have just learned agriculture. Where we were twenty thousand years ago.</p>
			<p>“You think any glib-talking Kwann can hang a lot of rags, bones and old iron onto himself, go through some impromptu mummery, and set up as shoonoo? Well, he can’t. The shoonoon are a hereditary caste. A shoonoo father will begin teaching his son as soon as he can walk and talk, and he keeps on teaching him till he’s the age-equivalent of a graduate <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.D.</abbr> or a science <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:name-title">Ph. D.</abbr>”</p>
			<p>“Well, what all is there to learn⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“The theoretical basis and practical applications of sympathetic magic. Action-at-a-distance by one object upon another. Homeopathic magic: the principle that things which resemble one another will interact. For instance, there’s an animal the natives call a shynph. It has an excrescence of horn on its brow like an arrowhead, and it arches its back like a bow when it jumps. Therefore, a shynph is equal to a bow and arrow, and for that reason the Kwanns made their bowstrings out of shynph-gut. Now they use tensilon because it won’t break as easily or get wet and stretch. So they have to turn the tensilon into shynph-gut. They used to do that by drawing a picture of a shynph on the spool, and then the traders began labeling the spools with pictures of shynph. I think my father was one of the first to do that.</p>
			<p>“Then, there’s contagious magic. Anything that’s been part of anything else or come in contact with it will interact permanently with it. I wish I had a sol for every time I’ve seen a Kwann pull the wad out of a shot-shell, pick up a pinch of dirt from the footprint of some animal he’s tracking, put it in among the buckshot, and then crimp the wad in again.</p>
			<p>“Everything a Kwann does has some sort of magical implications. It’s the shoonoo’s business to know all this; to be able to tell just what magical influences have to be produced, and what influences must be avoided. And there are circumstances in which magic simply will not work, even in theory. The reason is that there is some powerful counter-influence at work. He has to know when he can’t use magic, and he has to be able to explain why. And when he’s theoretically able to do something by magic, he has to have a plausible explanation why it won’t produce results⁠—just as any highly civilized and ethical Terran <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.D.</abbr> has to be able to explain his failures to the satisfaction of his late patient’s relatives. Only a shoonoo doesn’t get sued for malpractice; he gets a spear stuck in him. Under those circumstances, a caste of hereditary magicians is literally bred for quick thinking. These old gaffers we have aboard are the intellectual top crust among the natives. Any of them can think rings around your Government school products. As for preying on the ignorance and credulity of the other natives, they’re only infinitesimally less ignorant and credulous themselves. But they want to learn⁠—from anybody who can gain their respect by respecting them.”</p>
			<p>Edith Shaw didn’t say anything in reply. She was thoughtful during the rest of the meal, and when they were back on the observation deck he noticed that she seemed to be looking at the shoonoon with new eyes.</p>
			<p>In the screen-views of Bluelake, Beta had already set, and the sky was fading; stars had begun to twinkle. There were more fires⁠—one, close to the city in the east, a regular conflagration⁠—and fighting had broken out in the native city itself. He was wishing now, that he hadn’t thought it necessary to use those screens. The shoonoon were noticing what was going on in them, and talking among themselves. Travis, after one look at the situation, hurried back to the bridge to make a screen-call. After a while, he returned, almost crackling with suppressed excitement.</p>
			<p>“Well, it’s finally happened! Maith’s forced Kovac to declare martial rule!” he said in an exultant undertone.</p>
			<p>“Forced him?” Edith was puzzled. “The Army can’t force the Civil Government⁠—”</p>
			<p>“He threatened to do it himself. Intervene and suspend civil rule.”</p>
			<p>“But I thought only the Navy could do that.”</p>
			<p>“Any planetary commander of Armed Forces can, in a state of extreme emergency. I think you’ll both agree that this emergency is about as extreme as they come. Kovac knew that Maith was unwilling to do it⁠—he’d have to stand court-martial to justify his action⁠—but he also knew that a governor general who has his Colony taken away from him by the Armed Forces never gets it back; he’s finished. So it was just a case of the weaker man in the weaker position yielding.”</p>
			<p>“Where does this put us?”</p>
			<p>“We are a civilian scientific project. You are under orders of General Maith. I am under your orders. I don’t know about Edith.”</p>
			<p>“Can I draft her, or do I have to get you to get General Maith to do it?”</p>
			<p>“Listen, don’t do that,” Edith protested. “I still have to work for Government House, and this martial rule won’t last forever. They’ll all be prejudiced against me⁠—”</p>
			<p>“You can shove your Government job on the air lock,” Miles told her. “You’ll have a better one with <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Planetwide News</i>, at half again as much pay. And after the shakeup at Government House, about a year from now, you may be going back as director of <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.E.T.A.</abbr> When they find out on Terra just how badly this Government has been mismanaging things there’ll be a lot of vacancies.”</p>
			<p>The shoonoon had been watching the fighting in the viewscreens. Then somebody noticed that the spot of light on the navigational globe was approaching a coastline, and they all rushed forward for a look.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Travis and Edith slept for a while; when they returned to relieve him, Alpha was rising to the east of Bluelake, and the fighting in the city was still going on. The shoonoon were still wakeful and interested; Kwanns could go without sleep for much longer periods than Terrans. The lack of any fixed cycle of daylight and darkness on their planet had left them unconditioned to any regular sleeping-and-waking rhythm.</p>
			<p>“I just called in,” Travis said. “Things aren’t good, at all. Most of the natives in the evacuee cantonments have gotten into the native city, now, and they’ve gotten hold of a lot of firearms somehow. And they’re getting nasty in the west, beyond where Gonzales is occupying, and in the northeast, and we only have about half enough troops to cope with everything. The general wants to know how you’re making out with the shoonoon.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll call him before I get in the sack.”</p>
			<p>He went up on the bridge and made the call. General Maith looked as sleepy as he felt; they both yawned as they greeted each other. There wasn’t much he could tell the general, and it sounded like the glib reassurances one gets from a hospital about a friend’s condition.</p>
			<p>“We’ll check in with you as soon as we get back and get our shoonoon put away. We understand what’s motivating these frenzies, now, and in about twenty-five to thirty hours we’ll be able to start doing something about it.”</p>
			<p>The general, in the screen, grimaced.</p>
			<p>“That’s a long time, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert. Longer than we can afford to take, I’m afraid. You’re not cruising at full speed now, are you?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, general. We’re just trying to keep Alpha level on the horizon.” He thought for a moment. “We don’t need to keep down to that. It may make an even bigger impression if we speed up.”</p>
			<p>He went back to the observation deck, picked up the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.A.</abbr>-phone, and called for attention.</p>
			<p>“You have seen, now, that we can travel around the world, so fast that we keep up with the Sky Fire and it is not seen to set. Now we will travel even faster, and I will show you a new wonder. I will show you the Sky Fire rising in the west; it and the Always-Same will seem to go backward in the sky. This will not be for real; it will only be seen so because we will be traveling faster. Watch, now, and see.” He called the bridge for full speed, and then told them to look at the Sky-Fire and then see in the screens where it stood over Bluelake.</p>
			<p>That was even better; now they were racing with the Sky-Fire and catching up to it. After half an hour he left them still excited and whooping gleefully over the steady gain. Five hours later, when he came back after a nap and a hasty breakfast, they were still whooping. Edith Shaw was excited, too; the shoonoon were trying to estimate how soon they would be back to Bluelake by comparing the position of the Sky Fire with its position in the screen.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>General Maith received them in his private office at Army <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.Q.</abbr>; Foxx Travis mixed drinks for the four of them while the general checked the microphones to make sure they had privacy.</p>
			<p>“I blame myself for not having forced martial rule on them hundreds of hours ago,” he said. “I have three brigades; the one General Gonzales had here originally, and the two I brought with me when I took over here. We have to keep at least half a brigade in the south, to keep the tribes there from starting any more forest fires. I can’t hold Bluelake with anything less than half a brigade. Gonzales has his hands full in his area. He had a nasty business while you were off on that world cruise⁠—natives in one village caught the men stationed there off guard and wiped them out, and then started another frenzy. It spread to two other villages before he got it stopped. And we need the Third Brigade in the northeast; there are three quarters of a million natives up there, inhabiting close to a million square miles. And if anything really breaks loose here, and what’s been going on in the last few days is nothing even approaching what a real outbreak could be like, we’ll have to pull in troops from everywhere. We must save the Terran-type crops and the carniculture plants. If we don’t, we all starve.”</p>
			<p>Miles nodded. There wasn’t anything he could think of saying to that.</p>
			<p>“How soon can you begin to show results with those shoonoon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gilbert?” the general asked. “You said from twenty-five to thirty hours. Can you cut that any? In twenty-five hours, all hell could be loose all over the continent.”</p>
			<p>Miles shook his head. “So far, I haven’t accomplished anything positive,” he said. “All I did with this trip around the world was convince them that I was telling the truth when I told them there was no Dark Place under the World, where Alpha and Beta go at night.” He hastened, as the general began swearing, to add: “I know, that doesn’t sound like much. But it was necessary. I have to convince them that there will be no Last Hot Time, and then⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The shoonoon, on their drum-shaped cushions, stared at him in silence, aghast. All the happiness over the wonderful trip in the ship, when they had chased the Sky Fire around the World and caught it over Bluelake, and even their pleasure in the frozen delicacies they had just eaten, was gone.</p>
			<p>
				<em>“No⁠—Last⁠—Hot⁠—Time?”</em>
			</p>
			<p>“Mailsh Heelbare, this is not real! It cannot be!”</p>
			<p>“The Gone Ones⁠—”</p>
			<p>“The Always-Cool Time, when there will be no more hunger or hard work or death; it cannot be real that this will never come!”</p>
			<p>He rose, holding up his hands; his action stopped the clamor.</p>
			<p>“Why should the Gone Ones want to return to this poor world that they have gladly left?” he asked. “Have they not a better place in the middle of the Sky Fire, where it is always cool? And why should you want them to come back to this world? Will not each one of you pass, sooner or later, to the middle of the Sky Fire; will you not there be given new bodies and join the Gone Ones? There is the Always-Cool; there the crops grow without planting and without the work of women; there the game come into the villages to be killed in the gathering-places, without hunting. There you will talk with the other Gone Ones, your fathers and your fathers’ fathers, as I talk with you. Why do you think this must come to the World of People? Can you not wait to join the Gone Ones in the Sky Fire?”</p>
			<p>Then he sat down and folded his arms. They were looking at him in amazement; evidently they all saw the logic, but none of them had ever thought of it before. Now they would have to turn it over in their minds and accustom themselves to the new viewpoint. They began whooshing among themselves. At length, old Shatresh, who had seen the Hot Time before, spoke:</p>
			<p>“Mailsh Heelbare, we trust you,” he said. “You have told us of wonders, and you have shown us that they were real. But do you know this for real?”</p>
			<p>“Do you tell me that you do not?” he demanded in surprise. “You have had fathers, and fathers’ fathers. They have gone to join the Gone Ones. Why should you not, also? And why should the Gone Ones come back and destroy the World of People? Then your children will have no more children, and your children’s children will never be. It is in the World of People that the People are born; it is in the World that they grow and gain wisdom to fit themselves to live in the Place of the Gone Ones when they are through with the bodies they use in the World. You should be happy that there will be no Last Hot Time, and that the line of your begettings will go on and not be cut short.”</p>
			<p>There were murmurs of agreement with this. Most of them were beginning to be relieved that there wouldn’t be a Last Hot Time, after all. Then one of the class asked:</p>
			<p>“Do the Terrans also go to the Place of the Gone Ones, or have they a place of their own?”</p>
			<p>He was silent for a long time, looking down at the floor. Then he raised his head.</p>
			<p>“I had hoped that I would not have to speak of this,” he said. “But, since you have asked, it is right that I should tell you.” He hesitated again, until the Kwanns in front of him had begun to fidget. Then he asked old Shatresh: “Speak of the beliefs of the People about how the World was made.”</p>
			<p>“The great Spirit made the world.” He held up his carven obscenity. “He made the World out of himself. This is a make-like to show it.”</p>
			<p>“The Great Spirit made many worlds. The stars which you see in dark-time are all worlds, each with many smaller worlds around it. The Great Spirit made them all at one time, and made people on many of them. The Great Spirit made the World of People, and made the Always-Same and the Sky Fire, and inside the Sky Fire he made the Place of the Gone Ones. And when he made the Place of the Gone Ones, he put an Oomphel-Mother inside it, to bring forth oomphel.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>This created a brief sensation. An Oomphel-Mother was something they had never thought of before, but now they were wondering why they hadn’t. Of course there’d be an Oomphel-Mother; how else would there be oomphel?</p>
			<p>“The World of the Terrans is far away from the World of People, as we have always told you. When the Great Spirit made it He gave it only an Always-Same, and no Sky Fire. Since there was no Sky Fire, there was no place to put a Place of the Gone Ones, so the Great Spirit made the Terrans so that they would not die, but live forever in their own bodies. The Oomphel-Mother for the World of the Terrans the Great Spirit hid in a cave under a great mountain.</p>
			<p>“The Terrans whom the Great Spirit made lived for a long time, and then, one day, a man and a woman found a crack in a rock, and went inside, and they found the cave of the Oomphel-Mother, and the Oomphel-Mother in it. So they called all the other Terrans, and they brought the Oomphel-Mother out, and the Oomphel-Mother began to bring forth Oomphel. The Oomphel-Mother brought forth metal, and cloth, and glass, and plastic; knives, and axes and guns and clothing⁠—” He went on, cataloguing the products of human technology, the shoonoon staring more and more wide-eyed at him. “And oomphel to make oomphel, and oomphel to teach wisdom,” he finished. “They became very wise and very rich.</p>
			<p>“Then the Great Spirit saw what the Terrans had done, and became angry, for it was not meant for the Terrans to do this, and the Great Spirit cursed the Terrans with a curse of death. It was not death as you know it. Because the Terrans had sinned by laying hands on the Oomphel-Mother, not only their bodies must die, but their spirits also. A Terran has a short life in the body, after that no life.”</p>
			<p>“This, then, is the Oomphel Secret. The last skin of the fooshkoot has been peeled away; behold the bitter nut, upon which we Terrans have chewed for more time than anybody can count. Happy people! When you die or are slain, you go to the Place of the Gone Ones, to join your fathers and your fathers’ fathers and to await your children and children’s children. When we die or are slain, that is the end of us.”</p>
			<p>“But you have brought your oomphel into this world; have you not brought the curse with it?” somebody asked, frightened.</p>
			<p>“No. The People did not sin against the Great Spirit; they have not laid hands on an Oomphel-Mother as we did. The oomphel we bring you will do no harm; do you think we would be so wicked as to bring the curse upon you? It will be good for you to learn about oomphel here; in your Place of the Gone Ones there is much oomphel.”</p>
			<p>“Why did your people come to this world, Mailsh Heelbare?” old Shatresh asked. “Was it to try to hide from the curse?”</p>
			<p>“There is no hiding from the curse of the Great Spirit, but we Terrans are not a people who submit without strife to any fate. From the time of the Curse of Death on, we have been trying to make spirits for ourselves.”</p>
			<p>“But how can you do that?”</p>
			<p>“We do not know. The oomphel will not teach us that, though it teaches everything else. We have only learned many ways in which it cannot be done. It cannot be done with oomphel, or with anything that is in our own world. But the Oomphel-Mother made us ships to go to other worlds, and we have gone to many of them, this one among them, seeking things from which we try to make spirits. We are trying to make spirits for ourselves from the crystals that grow in the klooba plants; we may fail with them, too. But I say this; I may die, and all the other Terrans now living may die, and be as though they had never been, but someday we will not fail. Someday our children, or our children’s children, will make spirits for themselves and live forever, as you do.”</p>
			<p>“Why were we not told this before, Mailsh Heelbare?”</p>
			<p>“We were ashamed to have you know it. We are ashamed to be people without spirits.”</p>
			<p>“Can we help you and your people? Maybe our magic might help.”</p>
			<p>“It well might. It would be worth trying. But first, you must help yourselves. You and your people are sinning against the Great Spirit as grievously as did the Terrans of old. Be warned in time, lest you answer it as grievously.”</p>
			<p>“What do you mean, Mailsh Heelbare?” Old Shatresh was frightened.</p>
			<p>“You are making magic to bring the Sky Fire to the World. Do you know what will happen? The World of People will pass whole into the place of the Gone Ones, and both will be destroyed. The World of People is a world of death; everything that lives on it must die. The Place of the Gone Ones is a world of life; everything in it lives forever. The two will strive against each other, and will destroy one another, and there will be nothing in the Sky Fire or the World but fire. This is wisdom which our oomphel teaches us. We know this secret, and with it we make weapons of great destruction.” He looked over the seated shoonoon, picking out those who wore the flame-colored cloaks of the fire-dance. “You⁠—and you⁠—and you,” he said. “You have been making this dreadful magic, and leading your people in it. And which among the rest of you have not been guilty?”</p>
			<p>“We did not know,” one of them said. “Mailsh Heelbare, have we yet time to keep this from happening?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. There is only a little time, but there is time. You have until the Always-Same passes across the face of the Sky-Fire.” That would be seven hundred and fifty hours. “If this happens, all is safe. If the Sky Fire blots Out the Always Same, we are all lost together. You must go among your people and tell them what madness they are doing, and command them to stop. You must command them to lay down their arms and cease fighting. And you must tell them of the awful curse that was put upon the Terrans in the long-ago time, for a lesser sin than they are now committing.”</p>
			<p>“If we say that Mailsh Heelbare told us this, the people may not believe us. He is not known to all, and some would take no Terran’s word, not even his.”</p>
			<p>“Would anybody tell a secret of this sort, about his own people, if it were not real?”</p>
			<p>“We had better say nothing about Mailsh Heelbare. We will say that the Gone Ones told us in dreams.”</p>
			<p>“Let us say that the Great Spirit sent a dream of warning to each of us,” another shoonoo said. “There has been too much talk about dreams from the Gone Ones already.”</p>
			<p>“But the Great Spirit has never sent a dream⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Nothing like this has ever happened before, either.”</p>
			<p>He rose, and they were silent. “Go to your living-place, now,” he told them. “Talk of how best you may warn your people.” He pointed to the clock. “You have an oomphel like that in your living-place; when the shorter spear has moved three places, I will speak with you again, and then you will be sent in air cars to your people to speak to them.”</p>
			<p>They went up the escalator and down the hall to Miles’ office on the third floor without talking. Foxx Travis was singing softly, almost inaudibly:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:song">
				<p>
					<span>“You will eeeeaa⁠ ⁠… in the sweeeet⁠ ⁠… by-and-by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You’ll get oooom⁠ ⁠… phel in the sky⁠ ⁠… when you die!”</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Inside, Edith Shaw slumped dispiritedly in a chair. Foxx Travis went to the coffee-maker and started it. Miles snapped on the communication screen and punched the combination of General Maith’s headquarters. As soon as the uniformed girl who appeared in it saw him, her hands moved quickly; the screen flickered, and the general appeared in it.</p>
			<p>“We have it made, general. They’re sold; we’re ready to start them out in three hours.”</p>
			<p>Maith’s thin, weary face suddenly lighted. “You mean they are going to cooperate?”</p>
			<p>He shook his head. “They think they’re saving the world; they think we’re cooperating with them.”</p>
			<p>The general laughed. “That’s even better! How do you want them sent out?”</p>
			<p>“The ones in the Bluelake area first. Better have some picked <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">K.N.I.</abbr> in native costume, with pistols, to go with them. They’ll need protection, till they’re able to get a hearing for themselves. After they’re all out, the ones from Gonzales’ area can be started.” He thought for a moment. “I’ll want four or five of them left here to help me when you start bringing more shoonoon in from other areas. How soon do you think you’ll have another class for me?”</p>
			<p>“Two or three days, if everything goes all right. We have the villages and plantations in the south under pretty tight control now; we can start gathering them up right away. As soon as we get things stabilized here, we can send reinforcements to the north. We’ll have transport for you in three hours.”</p>
			<p>The general blanked out. He turned from the screen. Travis was laughing happily.</p>
			<p>“Miles, did anybody ever tell you you were a genius?” he asked. “That last jolt you gave them was perfect. Why didn’t you tell us about it in advance?”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t know about it in advance; I didn’t think of it till I’d started talking to them. No cream or sugar for me.”</p>
			<p>“Cream,” Edith said, lifelessly. “Why did you do it? Why didn’t you just tell them the truth?”</p>
			<p>Travis asked her to define the term. She started to say something bitter about Jesting Pilate. Miles interrupted.</p>
			<p>“In spite of Lord Beacon, Pilate wasn’t jesting,” he said. “And he didn’t stay for an answer because he knew he’d die of old age waiting for one. What kind of truth should I have told them?”</p>
			<p>“Why, what you started to tell them. That Beta moves in a fixed orbit and can’t get any closer to Alpha⁠—”</p>
			<p>“There’s been some work done on the question since Pilate’s time,” Travis said. “My semantics prof at Command College had the start of an answer. He defined truth as a statement having a practical correspondence with reality on the physical levels of structure and observation and the verbal order of abstraction under consideration.”</p>
			<p>“He defined truth as a statement. A statement exists only in the mind of the person making it, and the mind of the person to whom it is made. If the person to whom it is made can’t understand or accept it, it isn’t the truth.”</p>
			<p>“They understood when you showed them that the planet is round, and they understood that tri-dimensional model of the system. Why didn’t you let it go at that?”</p>
			<p>“They accepted it intellectually. But when I told them that there wasn’t any chance of Kwannon getting any closer to Alpha, they rebelled emotionally. It doesn’t matter how conclusively you prove anything, if the person to whom you prove it can’t accept your proof emotionally, it’s still false. Not-real.”</p>
			<p>“They had all their emotional capital invested in this Always-Cool Time,” Travis told her. “They couldn’t let Miles wipe that out for them. So he shifted it from this world to the next, and convinced them that they were getting a better deal that way. You saw how quickly they picked it up. And he didn’t have the sin of telling children there is no Easter Bunny on his conscience, either.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“But why did you tell them that story about the Oomphel Mother?” she insisted. “Now they’ll go out and tell all the other natives, and they’ll believe it.”</p>
			<p>“Would they have believed it if I’d told them about Terran scientific technology? Your people have been doing that for close to half a century. You see what impression it’s made.”</p>
			<p>“But you told them⁠—You told them that Terrans have no souls!”</p>
			<p>“Can you prove that was a lie?” Travis asked. “Let’s see yours. Draw⁠—<em>soul!</em> Inspection⁠—<em>soul!</em>”</p>
			<p>Naturally. Foxx Travis would expect a soul to be carried in a holster.</p>
			<p>“But they’ll look down on us, now. They’ll say we’re just like animals,” Edith almost wailed.</p>
			<p>“Now it comes out,” Travis said. “We won’t be the lordly Terrans, any more, helping the poor benighted Kwanns out of the goodness of our hearts, scattering largess, bearing the Terran’s Burden⁠—new model, a giveaway instead of a gun. Now <em>they’ll</em> pity <em>us</em>; they’ll think <em>we’re</em> inferior beings.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t think the natives are inferior beings!” She was almost in tears.</p>
			<p>“If you don’t, why did you come all the way to Kwannon to try to make them more like Terrans?”</p>
			<p>“Knock it off, Foxx; stop heckling her.” Travis looked faintly surprised. Maybe he hadn’t realized, before, that a boss newsman learns to talk like a commanding officer. “You remember what Ramón Gonzales was saying, out at Sanders,’ about the inferior’s hatred for the superior as superior? It’s no wonder these Kwanns resent us. They have a right to; we’ve done them all an unforgivable injury. We’ve let them see us doing things they can’t do. Of course they resent us. But now I’ve given them something to feel superior about. When they die, they’ll go to the Place of the Gone Ones, and have oomphel in the sky, and they will live forever in new bodies, but when we die, we just die, period. So they’ll pity us and politely try to hide their condescension toward us.</p>
			<p>“And because they feel superior to us, they’ll want to help us. They’ll work hard on the plantations, so that we can have plenty of biocrystals, and their shoonoon will work magic for us, to help us poor benighted Terrans to grow souls for ourselves, so that we can almost be like them. Of course, they’ll have a chance to exploit us, and get oomphel from us, too, but the important thing will be to help the poor Terrans. Maybe they’ll even organize a Spiritual and Magical Assistance Agency.”</p>

				<p>My Government was most delighted to learn of the splendid triumph of your Government in developing the new guided missile <i epub:type="se:name.vehicle">Marxist Victory</i>, and at the same time deeply relieved. We had, of course, detected the release of nuclear energy incident to the test, and inasmuch as it had obviously originated in the disintegration of a quantity of Uranium 235, we had feared that an explosion had occurred at your Government’s secret uranium plant at Khatanga. We have long known of the lax security measures in effect at this plant, and have, as a consequence, been expecting some disaster there.</p>
				<p>I am therefore sure that your Government will be equally gratified to learn of the perfection, by my Government, of our own new guided missile <i epub:type="se:name.vehicle">Celestial Destroyer</i>, which embodies, in greatly improved form, many of the features of your own Government’s guided missile <i epub:type="se:name.vehicle">Marxist Victory</i>. Naturally, your own scientific warfare specialists have detected the release of energy incident to the explosion of our own improved thorium-hafnium interaction bomb; this bomb was exploded over the North Polar ice cap, about two hundred miles south of the Pole, on about 35 degrees East Longitude, almost due north of your capital city of Moscow. The launching was made from a site in Tibet.</p>
				<p>Naturally, my Government cannot deviate from our present just and reasonable attitude in the Khakum River question. Trusting that your Government will realize this, I have the honor to be,</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Estimable Sir:</p>
				<p>In accordance with our established policy of free exchange with friendly Powers of scientific information, permit me to inform your Government that a new mutated disease-virus has been developed in our biological laboratories, causing a highly contagious disease similar in symptoms to bubonic plague, but responding to none of the treatments for this latter disease. This new virus strain was accidentally produced in the course of some experiments with radioactivity.</p>
				<p>In spite of the greatest care, it is feared that this virus has spread beyond the laboratory in which it was developed. We warn you most urgently of the danger that it may have spread to the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.E.E.S.R.</abbr>; enclosed are a list of symptoms, <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr></p>
				<p>My Government instructs me to advise your Government that the attitude of your Government in the Khakum River question is utterly unacceptable, and will require considerable revision before my Government can even consider negotiation with your Government on the subject.</p>

				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Honored Sir:</p>
				<p>Pursuant to our well known policy of exchanging scientific information with the Governments of friendly Powers, my Government takes the greatest pleasure in announcing a scientific discovery of inestimable value to the entire world. I refer to nothing less than a positive technique for liquidating rats as a species.</p>
				<p>This technique involves treatment of male rats with certain types of hard radiations, which not only renders them reproductively sterile but leaves the rodents so treated in full possession of all other sexual functions and impulses. Furthermore, this condition of sterility is venereally contagious, so that one male rat so treated will sterilize all female rats with which it comes in contact, and these, in turn, will sterilize all male rats coming in contact with them. Our mathematicians estimate that under even moderately favorable circumstances, the entire rat population of the world could be sterilized from one male rat in approximately two hundred years.</p>
				<p>Rats so treated have already been liberated in the granaries at Odessa; in three months, rat-trappings there have fallen by 26.4 percent, and grain-losses to rats by 32.09 percent.</p>
				<p>We are shipping you six dozen sterilized male rats, which you can use for sterilization stock, and, by so augmenting their numbers, may duplicate our own successes.</p>
				<p>Curiously enough, this effect of venereally contagious sterility was discovered quite accidentally, in connection with the use of hard radiations for human sterilization (criminals, mental defectives, <abbr>etc.</abbr>). Knowing the disastrous possible effects of an epidemic of contagious human sterility, all persons so sterilized were liquidated as soon as the contagious nature of their sterility had been discovered, with the exception of a dozen or so convicts, who had been released before this discovery was made. It is believed that at least some of them have made their way over the border and into the territory of the United Peoples’ Republics of East Asia. I must caution your Government to be on the lookout of them. Among a people still practicing ancestor-worship, an epidemic of sterility would be a disaster indeed.</p>
				<p>My Government must insist that your Government take some definite step toward the solution of the Khakum River question; the present position of the Government of the United Peoples’ Republics of East Asia on this subject is utterly unacceptable to the Government of the Union of East European Soviet Republics, and must be revised very considerably.</p>

A.</abbr> Mouzorgin, Premier-President of the Union of East European Soviet Republics, and Sung Li-Yin, President of the United Peoples’ Republics of East Asia,</p>
				<p epub:type="z3998:salutation">Greetings, in the name of Allah!</p>
				<p>For the past five years, I have watched, with growing concern, the increasing tensions between your Excellencies’ respective Governments, allegedly arising out of the so-called Khakum River question. It is my conviction that this Khakum River dispute is the utterly fraudulent device by which both Governments hope to create a pretext for the invasion of India, each ostensibly to rescue that unhappy country from the rapacity of the other. Your Excellencies must surely realize that this is a contingency which the Government of the Kingdom of Afghanistan cannot and will not permit; it would mean nothing short of the national extinction of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and the enslavement of the Afghan people.</p>
				<p>Your Excellencies will recall that I discussed this matter most urgently on the occasions of my visits to your respective capitals of Moscow and Nanking, and your respective attitudes, on those occasions, has firmly convinced me that neither of your Excellencies is by nature capable of adopting a rational or civilized attitude toward this question. It appears that neither of your Excellencies has any intention of abandoning your present war of mutual threats and blackmail until forced to do so by some overt act on the part of one or the other of your Excellencies’ Governments, which would result in physical war of pan-Asiatic scope and magnitude. I am further convinced that this deplorable situation arises out of the megalomaniac ambitions of the Federal Governments of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.E.E.S.R.</abbr> and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.P.R.E.A.</abbr>, respectively, and that the different peoples of what you unblushingly call your “autonomous” republics have no ambitions except, on a rapidly diminishing order of probability, to live out their natural span of years in peace. Therefore:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>In the name of <b>Allah</b>, the Merciful, the Compassionate: We, Shere Ali Abdallah, Ameer of Afghanistan, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, do decree and command that the political entities known as the Union of East European Soviet Republics and the United Peoples’ Republics of East Asia respectively are herewith abolished and dissolved into their constituent autonomous republics, each one of which shall hereafter enjoy complete sovereignty within its own borders as is right and proper.</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>Now, in case either of you gentlemen feel inclined to laugh this off, let me remind you of the series of mysterious disappearances of some of the most noted scientists of both the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.E.E.S.R.</abbr> and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.P.R.E.A.</abbr>, and let me advise your Excellencies that these scientists are now residents and subjects of the Kingdom of Afghanistan, and are here engaged in research and development work for my Government. These gentlemen were not abducted, as you gentlemen seem to believe; they came here of their own free will, and ask nothing better than to remain here, where they are treated with dignity and honor, given material rewards⁠—riches, palaces, harems, retinues of servants, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—and are also free from the intellectual and ideological restraints which make life so intolerable in your respective countries to any man above the order of intelligence of a cretin. In return for these benefactions, these eminent scientists have developed, for my Government, certain weapons. For example:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>A nuclear-rocket guided missile, officially designated as the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel">Sword of Islam</i>, vastly superior to your Excellencies’ respective guided missiles <i epub:type="se:name.vessel">Marxist Victory</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.vessel">Celestial Destroyer</i>. It should be; it was the product of the joint efforts of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Voronoff and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Bao Hu-Shin, whom your Excellencies know.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>A new type of radar-radio-electronic defense screen, which can not only detect the approach of a guided missile, at any velocity whatever, but will automatically capture and redirect same. In case either of your Excellencies doubt this statement, you are invited to aim a rocket at some target in Afghanistan and see what happens.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Both the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.P.R.E.A.</abbr> mutated virus and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.E.E.S.R.</abbr> contagious sterility, with positive vaccines against the former and means of instrumental detection of the latter.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>A technique for initiating and controlling the Bethe carbon-hydrogen cycle. We are now using this as a source of heat for industrial and even domestic purposes, and we also have a carbon-hydrogen cycle bomb. Such a bomb, delivered by one of our <i epub:type="se:name.vessel">Sword of Islam</i> Mark <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>’s, was activated yesterday over the Northern tip of Nova Zembla, at an altitude of four miles. I am enclosing photographic reproductions of views of this test, televised to Kabul by an accompanying <i epub:type="se:name.vessel">Sword of Islam</i> Mark <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> observation rocket. I am informed that expeditions have been sent by both the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.E.E.S.R.</abbr> and the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.P.R.E.A.</abbr> to investigate; they should find some very interesting conditions. For one thing, they won’t need their climbing equipment to get over the Nova Zembla Glacier; the Nova Zembla Glacier isn’t there, any more.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>A lithium bomb. This has not been tested, yet. A lithium bomb is nothing for a country the size of Afghanistan to let off inside its own borders. We intend making a test with it within the next ten days, however If your Excellencies will designate a target, which must be at the center of an uninhabited area at least five hundred miles square, the test can be made in perfect safety. If not, I cannot answer the results; that will be in the hands of Allah, Who has ordained all things. No doubt Allah has ordained the destruction of either Moscow or Nanking; whichever city Allah has elected to erase, I will make it my personal responsibility to see to it that the other isn’t slighted, either.</p>
					</li>
				</ol>
				<p>However, if your Excellencies decide to accede to my modest and reasonable demands, not later than one week from today, this test-launching will be cancelled as unnecessary. Of course, that would leave unsettled a bet I have made with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hong Foo⁠—a star sapphire against his favorite Persian concubine⁠—that the explosion of a lithium bomb will not initiate a chain reaction in the Earth’s crust and so disintegrate this planet. This, of course, is a minor consideration, unworthy of Your notice.</p>
				<p>Of course, I am aware that both your Excellencies have, in the past, fomented mutual jealousies and suspicions among the several “autonomous” republics under your respective jurisdictions, as an instrument of policy. If these peoples were, at this time, to receive full independence, the present inevitability of a pan-Asiatic war on a grand scale would be replaced only by the inevitability of a pan-Asiatic war by detail. Obviously, some single supranational sovereignty is needed to maintain peace, and such a sovereignty should be established under some leadership not hitherto associated with either the former <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.E.E.S.R.</abbr> or the former <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.P.R.E.A.</abbr> I humbly offer myself as President of such a supranational organization, counting as a matter of course upon the wholehearted support and cooperation of both your Excellencies. It might be well if both your Excellencies were to come here to Kabul to confer with me on this subject at your very earliest convenience.</p>

				<p>“… there may be something in the nature of an occult police force, which operates to divert human suspicions, and to supply explanations that are good enough for whatever, somewhat in the nature of minds, human beings have⁠—or that, if there be occult mischief makers and occult ravagers, they may be of a world also of other beings that are acting to check them, and to explain them, not benevolently, but to divert suspicion from themselves, because they, too, may be exploiting life upon this earth, but in ways more subtle, and in orderly, or organised, fashion.”</p>

			<p>John Strawmyer stood, an irate figure in faded overalls and sweat-whitened black shirt, apart from the others, his back to the weathered farm-buildings and the line of yellowing woods and the cirrus-streaked blue October sky. He thrust out a work-gnarled hand accusingly.</p>
			<p>“That there heifer was worth two hund’rd, two hund’rd an’ fifty dollars!” he clamored. “An’ that there dog was just like one uh the fam’ly; An’ now look at’m! I don’t like t’ use profane language, but you’ns gotta <em>do</em> some’n about this!”</p>
			<p>Steve Parker, the district game protector, aimed his Leica at the carcass of the dog and snapped the shutter. “We’re doing something about it,” he said shortly. Then he stepped ten feet to the left and edged around the mangled heifer, choosing an angle for his camera shot.</p>
			<p>The two men in the gray whipcords of the State police, seeing that Parker was through with the dog, moved in and squatted to examine it. The one with the triple chevrons on his sleeves took it by both forefeet and flipped it over on its back. It had been a big brute, of nondescript breed, with a rough black-and-brown coat. Something had clawed it deeply about the head, its throat was slashed transversely several times, and it had been disemboweled by a single slash that had opened its belly from breastbone to tail. They looked at it carefully, and then went to stand beside Parker while he photographed the dead heifer. Like the dog, it had been talon-raked on either side of the head, and its throat had been slashed deeply several times. In addition, flesh had been torn from one flank in great strips.</p>
			<p>“I can’t kill a bear outa season, no!” Strawmyer continued his plaint. “But a bear comes an’ kills my stock an’ my dog; that there’s all right! That’s the kinda deal a farmer always gits, in this state! I don’t like t’ use profane language⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Then don’t!” Parker barked at him, impatiently. “Don’t use any kind of language. Just put in your claim and shut up!” He turned to the men in whipcords and gray Stetsons. “You boys seen everything?” he asked. “Then let’s go.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They walked briskly back to the barnyard, Strawmyer following them, still vociferating about the wrongs of the farmer at the hands of a cynical and corrupt State government. They climbed into the State police car, the sergeant and the private in front and Parker into the rear, laying his camera on the seat beside a Winchester carbine.</p>
			<p>“Weren’t you pretty short with that fellow, back there, Steve?” the sergeant asked as the private started the car.</p>
			<p>“Not too short. ‘I don’t like t’ use profane language,’ ” Parker mimicked the bereaved heifer owner, and then he went on to specify: “I’m morally certain that he’s shot at least four illegal deer in the last year. When and if I ever get anything on him, he’s going to be sorrier for himself then he is now.”</p>
			<p>“They’re the characters that always beef their heads off,” the sergeant agreed. “You think that whatever did this was the same as the others?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. The dog must have jumped it while it was eating at the heifer. Same superficial scratches about the head, and deep cuts on the throat or belly. The bigger the animal, the farther front the big slashes occur. Evidently something grabs them by the head with front claws, and slashes with hind claws; that’s why I think it’s a bobcat.”</p>
			<p>“You know,” the private said, “I saw a lot of wounds like that during the war. My outfit landed on Mindanao, where the guerrillas had been active. And this looks like bolo-work to me.”</p>
			<p>“The surplus-stores are full of machetes and jungle knives,” the sergeant considered. “I think I’ll call up Doc Winters, at the County Hospital, and see if all his squirrel-fodder is present and accounted for.”</p>
			<p>“But most of the livestock was eaten at, like the heifer,” Parker objected.</p>
			<p>“By definition, nuts have abnormal tastes,” the sergeant replied. “Or the eating might have been done later, by foxes.”</p>
			<p>“I hope so; that’d let me out,” Parker said.</p>
			<p>“Ha, listen to the man!” the private howled, stopping the car at the end of the lane. “He thinks a nut with a machete and a Tarzan complex is just good clean fun. Which way, now?”</p>
			<p>“Well, let’s see.” The sergeant had unfolded a quadrangle sheet; the game protector leaned forward to look at it over his shoulder. The sergeant ran a finger from one to another of a series of variously colored crosses which had been marked on the map.</p>
			<p>“Monday night, over here on Copperhead Mountain, that cow was killed,” he said. “The next night, about ten o’clock, that sheepflock was hit, on this side of Copperhead, right about here. Early Wednesday night, that mule got slashed up in the woods back of the Weston farm. It was only slightly injured; must have kicked the whatzit and got away, but the whatzit wasn’t too badly hurt, because a few hours later, it hit that turkey-flock on the Rhymer farm. And last night, it did that.” He jerked a thumb over his shoulder at the Strawmyer farm. “See, following the ridges, working toward the southeast, avoiding open ground, killing only at night. Could be a bobcat, at that.”</p>
			<p>“Or Jink’s maniac with the machete,” Parker agreed. “Let’s go up by Hindman’s gap and see if we can see anything.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They turned, after a while, into a rutted dirt road, which deteriorated steadily into a grass-grown track through the woods. Finally, they stopped, and the private backed off the road. The three men got out; Parker with his Winchester, the sergeant checking the drum of a Thompson, and the private pumping a buckshot shell into the chamber of a riot gun. For half an hour, they followed the brush-grown trail beside the little stream; once, they passed a dark gray commercial-model jeep, backed to one side. Then they came to the head of the gap.</p>
			<p>A man, wearing a tweed coat, tan field boots, and khaki breeches, was sitting on a log, smoking a pipe; he had a bolt-action rifle across his knees, and a pair of binoculars hung from his neck. He seemed about thirty years old, and any bobbysoxer’s idol of the screen would have envied him the handsome regularity of his strangely immobile features. As Parker and the two State policemen approached, he rose, slinging his rifle, and greeted them.</p>
			<p>“Sergeant Haines, isn’t it?” he asked pleasantly. “Are you gentlemen out hunting the critter, too?”</p>
			<p>“Good afternoon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lee. I thought that was your jeep I saw, down the road a little.” The sergeant turned to the others. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Richard Lee; staying at the old Kinchwalter place, the other side of Rutter’s Fort. This is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Parker, the district game protector. And Private Zinkowski.” He glanced at the rifle. “Are you out hunting for it, too?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I thought I might find something, up here. What do you think it is?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know,” the sergeant admitted. “It could be a bobcat. Canada lynx. Jink, here, has a theory that it’s some escapee from the paper-doll factory, with a machete. Me, I hope not, but I’m not ignoring the possibility.”</p>
			<p>The man with the matinee-idol’s face nodded. “It could be a lynx. I understand they’re not unknown, in this section.”</p>
			<p>“We paid bounties on two in this county, in the last year,” Parker said. “Odd rifle you have, there; mind if I look at it?”</p>
			<p>“Not at all.” The man who had been introduced as Richard Lee unslung and handed it over. “The chamber’s loaded,” he cautioned.</p>
			<p>“I never saw one like this,” Parker said. “Foreign?”</p>
			<p>“I think so. I don’t know anything about it; it belongs to a friend of mine, who loaned it to me. I think the action’s German, or Czech; the rest of it’s a custom job, by some West Coast gunmaker. It’s chambered for some ultra-velocity wildcat load.”</p>
			<p>The rifle passed from hand to hand; the three men examined it in turn, commenting admiringly.</p>
			<p>“You find anything, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lee?” the sergeant asked, handing it back.</p>
			<p>“Not a trace.” The man called Lee slung the rifle and began to dump the ashes from his pipe. “I was along the top of this ridge for about a mile on either side of the gap, and down the other side as far as Hindman’s Run; I didn’t find any tracks, or any indication of where it had made a kill.”</p>
			<p>The game protector nodded, turning to Sergeant Haines.</p>
			<p>“There’s no use us going any farther,” he said. “Ten to one, it followed that line of woods back of Strawmyer’s, and crossed over to the other ridge. I think our best bet would be the hollow at the head of Lowrie’s Run. What do you think?”</p>
			<p>The sergeant agreed. The man called Richard Lee began to refill his pipe methodically.</p>
			<p>“I think I shall stay here for a while, but I believe you’re right. Lowrie’s Run, or across Lowrie’s Gap into Coon Valley,” he said.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>After Parker and the State policemen had gone, the man whom they had addressed as Richard Lee returned to his log and sat smoking, his rifle across his knees. From time to time, he glanced at his wrist watch and raised his head to listen. At length, faint in the distance, he heard the sound of a motor starting.</p>
			<p>Instantly, he was on his feet. From the end of the hollow log on which he had been sitting, he produced a canvas musette-bag. Walking briskly to a patch of damp ground beside the little stream, he leaned the rifle against a tree and opened the bag. First, he took out a pair of gloves of some greenish, rubberlike substance, and put them on, drawing the long gauntlets up over his coat sleeves. Then he produced a bottle and unscrewed the cap. Being careful to avoid splashing his clothes, he went about, pouring a clear liquid upon the ground in several places. Where he poured, white vapors rose, and twigs and grass crumbled into brownish dust. After he had replaced the cap and returned the bottle to the bag, he waited for a few minutes, then took a spatula from the musette and dug where he had poured the fluid, prying loose four black, irregular-shaped lumps of matter, which he carried to the running water and washed carefully, before wrapping them and putting them in the bag, along with the gloves. Then he slung bag and rifle and started down the trail to where he had parked the jeep.</p>
			<p>Half an hour later, after driving through the little farming village of Rutter’s Fort, he pulled into the barnyard of a rundown farm and backed through the open doors of the barn. He closed the double doors behind him, and barred them from within. Then he went to the rear wall of the barn, which was much closer the front than the outside dimensions of the barn would have indicated.</p>
			<p>He took from his pocket a black object like an automatic pencil. Hunting over the rough plank wall, he found a small hole and inserted the pointed end of the pseudo-pencil, pressing on the other end. For an instant, nothing happened. Then a ten-foot-square section of the wall receded two feet and slid noiselessly to one side. The section which had slid inward had been built of three-inch steel, masked by a thin covering of boards; the wall around it was two-foot concrete, similarly camouflaged. He stepped quickly inside.</p>
			<p>Fumbling at the right side of the opening, he found a switch and flicked it. Instantly, the massive steel plate slid back into place with a soft, oily click. As it did, lights came on within the hidden room, disclosing a great semiglobe of some fine metallic mesh, thirty feet in diameter and fifteen in height. There was a sliding door at one side of this; the man called Richard Lee opened and entered through it, closing it behind him. Then he turned to the center of the hollow dome, where an armchair was placed in front of a small desk below a large instrument panel. The gauges and dials on the panel, and the levers and switches and buttons on the desk control board, were all lettered and numbered with characters not of the Roman alphabet or the Arabic notation, and, within instant reach of the occupant of the chair, a pistollike weapon lay on the desk. It had a conventional index-finger trigger and a hand-fit grip, but, instead of a tubular barrel, two slender parallel metal rods extended about four inches forward of the receiver, joined together at what would correspond to the muzzle by a streamlined knob of some light blue ceramic or plastic substance.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The man with the handsome immobile face deposited his rifle and musette on the floor beside the chair and sat down. First, he picked up the pistollike weapon and checked it, and then he examined the many instruments on the panel in front of him. Finally, he flicked a switch on the control board.</p>
			<p>At once, a small humming began, from some point overhead. It wavered and shrilled and mounted in intensity, and then fell to a steady monotone. The dome about him flickered with a queer, cold iridescence, and slowly vanished. The hidden room vanished, and he was looking into the shadowy interior of a deserted barn. The barn vanished; blue sky appeared above, streaked with wisps of high cirrus cloud. The autumn landscape flickered unreally. Buildings appeared and vanished, and other buildings came and went in a twinkling. All around him, half-seen shapes moved briefly and disappeared.</p>
			<p>Once, the figure of a man appeared, inside the circle of the dome. He had an angry, brutal face, and he wore a black tunic piped with silver, and black breeches, and polished black boots, and there was an insignia, composed of a cross and thunderbolt, on his cap. He held an automatic pistol in his hand.</p>
			<p>Instantly, the man at the desk snatched up his own weapon and thumbed off the safety, but before he could lift and aim it, the intruder stumbled and passed outside the force-field which surrounded the chair and instruments.</p>
			<p>For a while, there were fires raging outside, and for a while, the man at the desk was surrounded by a great hall, with a high, vaulted ceiling, through which figures flitted and vanished. For a while, there were vistas of deep forests, always set in the same background of mountains and always under the same blue cirrus-laced sky. There was an interval of flickering blue-white light, of unbearable intensity. Then the man at the desk was surrounded by the interior of vast industrial works. The moving figures around him slowed, and became more distinct. For an instant, the man in the chair grinned as he found himself looking into a big washroom, where a tall blond girl was taking a shower bath, and a pert little redhead was vigorously drying herself with a towel. The dome grew visible, coruscating with many-colored lights and then the humming died and the dome became a cold and inert mesh of fine white metal. A green light above flashed on and off slowly.</p>
			<p>He stabbed a button and flipped a switch, then got to his feet, picking up his rifle and musette and fumbling under his shirt for a small mesh bag, from which he took an inch-wide disk of blue plastic. Unlocking a container on the instrument panel, he removed a small roll of solidograph-film, which he stowed in his bag. Then he slid open the door and emerged into his own dimension of space-time.</p>
			<p>Outside was a wide hallway, with a pale green floor, paler green walls, and a ceiling of greenish off-white. A big hole had been cut to accommodate the dome, and across the hallway a desk had been set up, and at it sat a clerk in a pale blue tunic, who was just taking the audio-plugs of a music-box out of his ears. A couple of policemen in green uniforms, with ultrasonic paralyzers dangling by thongs from their left wrists and holstered sigma-ray needlers like the one on the desk inside the dome, were kidding with some girls in vivid orange and scarlet and green smocks. One of these, in bright green, was a duplicate of the one he had seen rubbing herself down with a towel.</p>
			<p>“Here comes your boss-man,” one of the girls told the cops, as he approached. They both turned and saluted casually. The man who had lately been using the name of Richard Lee responded to their greeting and went to the desk. The policemen grasped their paralyzers, drew their needlers, and hurried into the dome.</p>
			<p>Taking the disk of blue plastic from his packet, he handed it to the clerk at the desk, who dropped it into a slot in the voder in front of him. Instantly, a mechanical voice responded:</p>
			<p>“Verkan Vall, blue-seal noble, hereditary Mavrad of Nerros. Special Chief’s Assistant, Paratime Police, special assignment. Subject to no orders below those of Tortha Karf, Chief of Paratime Police. To be given all courtesies and cooperation within the Paratime Transposition Code and the Police Powers Code. Further particulars?”</p>
			<p>The clerk pressed the “no”-button. The blue sigil fell out the release-slot and was handed back to its bearer, who was drawing up his left sleeve.</p>
			<p>“You’ll want to be sure I’m <em>your</em> Verkan Vall, I suppose?” he said, extending his arm.</p>
			<p>“Yes, quite, sir.”</p>
			<p>The clerk touched his arm with a small instrument which swabbed it with antiseptic, drew a minute blood-sample, and medicated the needle prick, all in one almost painless operation. He put the blood-drop on a slide and inserted it at one side of a comparison microscope, nodding. It showed the same distinctive permanent colloid pattern as the sample he had ready for comparison; the colloid pattern given in infancy by injection to the man in front of him, to set him apart from all the myriad other Verkan Valls on every other probability-line of paratime.</p>
			<p>“Right, sir,” the clerk nodded.</p>
			<p>The two policemen came out of the dome, their needlers holstered and their vigilance relaxed. They were lighting cigarettes as they emerged.</p>
			<p>“It’s all right, sir,” one of them said. “You didn’t bring anything in with you, this trip.”</p>
			<p>The other cop chuckled. “Remember that Fifth Level wild-man who came in on the freight conveyor at Jandar, last month?” he asked.</p>
			<p>If he was hoping that some of the girls would want to know, what wild-man, it was a vain hope. With a blue-seal mavrad around, what chance did a couple of ordinary coppers have? The girls were already converging on Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>“When are you going to get that monstrosity out of our restroom,” the little redhead in green coveralls was demanding. “If it wasn’t for that thing, I’d be taking a shower, right now.”</p>
			<p>“You were just finishing one, about fifty paraseconds off, when I came through,” Verkan Vall told her.</p>
			<p>The girl looked at him in obviously feigned indignation.</p>
			<p>“Why, you⁠—You <em>parapeeper</em>!”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall chuckled and turned to the clerk. “I want a strato-rocket and pilot, for Dhergabar, right away. Call Dhergabar Paratime Police Field and give them my <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.T.A.</abbr>; have an air-taxi meet me, and have the chief notified that I’m coming in. Extraordinary report. Keep a guard over the conveyor; I think I’m going to need it, again, soon.” He turned to the little redhead. “Want to show me the way out of here, to the rocket field?” he asked.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Outside, on the open landing field, Verkan Vall glanced up at the sky, then looked at his watch. It had been twenty minutes since he had backed the jeep into the barn, on that distant other timeline; the same delicate lines of white cirrus were etched across the blue above. The constancy of the weather, even across two hundred thousand parayears of perpendicular time, never failed to impress him. The long curve of the mountains was the same, and they were mottled with the same autumn colors, but where the little village of Rutter’s Fort stood on that other line of probability, the white towers of an apartment-city rose⁠—the living quarters of the plant personnel.</p>
			<p>The rocket that was to take him to headquarters was being hoisted with a crane and lowered into the firing-stand, and he walked briskly toward it, his rifle and musette slung. A boyish-looking pilot was on the platform, opening the door of the rocket; he stood aside for Verkan Vall to enter, then followed and closed it, dogging it shut while his passenger stowed his bag and rifle and strapped himself into a seat.</p>
			<p>“Dhergabar Commercial Terminal, sir?” the pilot asked, taking the adjoining seat at the controls.</p>
			<p>“Paratime Police Field, back of the Paratime Administration Building.”</p>
			<p>“Right, sir. Twenty seconds to blast, when you’re ready.”</p>
			<p>“Ready now.” Verkan Vall relaxed, counting seconds subconsciously.</p>
			<p>The rocket trembled, and Verkan Vall felt himself being pushed gently back against the upholstery. The seats, and the pilot’s instrument panel in front of them, swung on gimbals, and the finger of the indicator swept slowly over a ninety-degree arc as the rocket rose and leveled. By then, the high cirrus clouds Verkan Vall had watched from the field were far below; they were well into the stratosphere.</p>
			<p>There would be nothing to do, now, for the three hours in which the rocket sped northward across the pole and southward to Dhergabar; the navigation was entirely in the electronic hands of the robot controls. Verkan Vall got out his pipe and lit it; the pilot lit a cigarette.</p>
			<p>“That’s an odd pipe, sir,” the pilot said. “Outtime item?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Fourth Probability Level; typical of the whole paratime belt I was working in.” Verkan Vall handed it over for inspection. “The bowl’s natural brier-root; the stem’s a sort of plastic made from the sap of certain tropical trees. The little white dot is the maker’s trademark; it’s made of elephant tusk.”</p>
			<p>“Sounds pretty crude to me, sir.” The pilot handed it back. “Nice workmanship, though. Looks like good machine production.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. The sector I was on is really quite advanced, for an electrochemical civilization. That weapon I brought back with me⁠—that solid-missile projector⁠—is typical of most Fourth Level culture. Moving parts machined to the closest tolerances, and interchangeable with similar parts of all similar weapons. The missile is a small bolt of cupro-alloy coated lead, propelled by expanding gases from the ignition of some nitrocellulose compound. Most of their scientific advance occurred within the past century, and most of that in the past forty years. Of course, the life-expectancy on that level is only about seventy years.”</p>
			<p>“Humph! I’m seventy-eight, last birthday,” the boyish-looking pilot snorted. “Their medical science must be mostly witchcraft!”</p>
			<p>“Until quite recently, it was,” Verkan Vall agreed. “Same story there as in everything else⁠—rapid advancement in the past few decades, after thousands of years of cultural inertia.”</p>
			<p>“You know, sir, I don’t really understand this paratime stuff,” the pilot confessed. “I know that all time is totally present, and that every moment has its own past-future line of event-sequence, and that all events in space-time occur according to maximum probability, but I just don’t get this alternate probability stuff, at all. If something exists, it’s because it’s the maximum-probability effect of prior causes; why does anything else exist on any other timeline?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Verkan Vall blew smoke at the air-renovator. A lecture on paratime theory would nicely fill in the three-hour interval until the landing at Dhergabar. At least, this kid was asking intelligent questions.</p>
			<p>“Well, you know the principal of time-passage, I suppose?” he began.</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course; Rhogom’s Doctrine. The basis of most of our psychical science. We exist perpetually at all moments within our lifespan; our extraphysical ego component passes from the ego existing at one moment to the ego existing at the next. During unconsciousness, the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.P.C.</abbr> is ‘time-free’; it may detach, and connect at some other moment, with the ego existing at that time-point. That’s how we precog. We take an autohypno and recover memories brought back from the future moment and buried in the subconscious mind.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” Verkan Vall told him. “And even without the autohypno, a lot of precognitive matter leaks out of the subconscious and into the conscious mind, usually in distorted forms, or else inspires ‘instinctive’ acts, the motivation for which is not brought to the level of consciousness. For instance, suppose, you’re walking along North Promenade, in Dhergabar, and you come to the Martian Palace Café, and you go in for a drink, and meet some girl, and strike up an acquaintance with her. This chance acquaintance develops into a love affair, and a year later, out of jealousy, she rays you half a dozen times with a needler.”</p>
			<p>“Just about that happened to a friend of mine, not long ago,” the pilot said. “Go on, sir.”</p>
			<p>“Well, in the microsecond or so before you die⁠—or afterward, for that matter, because we know that the extraphysical component survives physical destruction⁠—your <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.P.C.</abbr> slips back a couple of years, and re-connects at some point pastward of your first meeting with this girl, and carries with it memories of everything up to the moment of detachment, all of which are indelibly recorded in your subconscious mind. So, when you re-experience the event of standing outside the Martian Palace with a thirst, you go on to the Starway, or Nhergal’s, or some other bar. In both cases, on both timelines, you follow the line of maximum probability; in the second case, your subconscious future memories are an added causal factor.”</p>
			<p>“And when I back-slip, after I’ve been needled, I generate a new timeline? Is that it?”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall made a small sound of impatience. “No such thing!” he exclaimed. “It’s semantically inadmissible to talk about the total presence of time with one breath and about generating new timelines with the next. <em>All</em> timelines are totally present, in perpetual coexistence. The theory is that the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.P.C.</abbr> passes from one moment, on one timeline, to the next moment on the next line, so that the true passage of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.P.C.</abbr> from moment to moment is a two-dimensional diagonal. So, in the case we’re using, the event of your going into the Martian Palace exists on one timeline, and the event of your passing along to the Starway exists on another, but both are events in real existence.</p>
			<p>“Now, what we do, in paratime transposition, is to build up a hypertemporal field to include the timeline we want to reach, and then shift over to it. Same point in the plenum; same point in primary time⁠—plus primary time elapsed during mechanical and electronic lag in the relays⁠—but a different line of secondary time.”</p>
			<p>“Then why don’t we have past-future time travel on our own timeline?” the pilot wanted to know.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>That was a question every paratimer has to answer, every time he talks paratime to the laity. Verkan Vall had been expecting it; he answered patiently.</p>
			<p>“The Ghaldron-Hesthor field-generator is like every other mechanism; it can operate only in the area of primary time in which it exists. It can transpose to any other timeline, and carry with it anything inside its field, but it can’t go outside its own temporal area of existence, any more than a bullet from that rifle can hit the target a week before it’s fired,” Verkan Vall pointed out. “Anything inside the field is supposed to be unaffected by anything outside. <em>Supposed to be</em> is the way to put it; it doesn’t always work. Once in a while, something pretty nasty gets picked up in transit.” He thought, briefly, of the man in the black tunic. “That’s why we have armed guards at terminals.”</p>
			<p>“Suppose you pick up a blast from a nucleonic bomb,” the pilot asked, “or something red-hot, or radioactive?”</p>
			<p>“We have a monument, at Paratime Police Headquarters, in Dhergabar, bearing the names of our own personnel who didn’t make it back. It’s a large monument; over the past ten thousand years, it’s been inscribed with quite a few names.”</p>
			<p>“You can have it; I’ll stick to rockets!” the pilot replied. “Tell me another thing, though: What’s all this about levels, and sectors, and belts? What’s the difference?”</p>
			<p>“Purely arbitrary terms. There are five main probability levels, derived from the five possible outcomes of the attempt to colonize this planet, seventy-five thousand years ago. We’re on the First Level⁠—complete success, and colony fully established. The Fifth Level is the probability of complete failure⁠—no human population established on this planet, and indigenous quasi-human life evolved indigenously. On the Fourth Level, the colonists evidently met with some disaster and lost all memory of their extraterrestrial origin, as well as all extraterrestrial culture. As far as they know, they are an indigenous race; they have a long prehistory of stone-age savagery.</p>
			<p>“Sectors are areas of paratime on any level in which the prevalent culture has a common origin and common characteristics. They are divided more or less arbitrarily into sub-sectors. Belts are areas within sub-sectors where conditions are the result of recent alternate probabilities. For instance, I’ve just come from the Europo-American Sector of the Fourth Level, an area of about ten thousand parayears in depth, in which the dominant civilization developed on the Northwest Continent of the Major Land Mass, and spread from there to the Minor Land Mass. The line on which I was operating is also part of a sub-sector of about three thousand parayears’ depth, and a belt developing from one of several probable outcomes of a war concluded about three elapsed years ago. On that timeline, the field at the Hagraban Synthetics Works, where we took off, is part of an abandoned farm; on the site of Hagraban City is a little farming village. Those things are there, right now, both in primary time and in the plenum. They are about two hundred and fifty thousand parayears perpendicular to each other, and each is of the same general order of reality.”</p>
			<p>The red light overhead flashed on. The pilot looked into his visor and put his hands to the manual controls, in case of failure of the robot controls. The rocket landed smoothly, however; there was a slight jar as it was grappled by the crane and hoisted upright, the seats turning in their gimbals. Pilot and passenger unstrapped themselves and hurried through the refrigerated outlet and away from the glowing-hot rocket.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>An air-taxi, emblazoned with the device of the Paratime Police, was waiting. Verkan Vall said goodbye to the rocket-pilot and took his seat beside the pilot of the aircab; the latter lifted his vehicle above the building level and then set it down on the landing-stage of the Paratime Police Building in a long, side-swooping glide. An express elevator took Verkan Vall down to one of the middle stages, where he showed his sigil to the guard outside the door of Tortha Karf’s office and was admitted at once.</p>
			<p>The Paratime Police chief rose from behind his semicircular desk, with its array of keyboards and viewing-screens and communicators. He was a big man, well past his two hundredth year; his hair was iron-gray and thinning in front, he had begun to grow thick at the waist, and his calm features bore the lines of middle age. He wore the dark-green uniform of the Paratime Police.</p>
			<p>“Well, Vall,” he greeted. “Everything secure?”</p>
			<p>“Not exactly, sir.” Verkan Vall came around the desk, deposited his rifle and bag on the floor, and sat down in one of the spare chairs. “I’ll have to go back again.”</p>
			<p>“So?” His chief lit a cigarette and waited.</p>
			<p>“I traced Gavran Sarn.” Verkan Vall got out his pipe and began to fill it. “But that’s only the beginning. I have to trace something else. Gavran Sarn exceeded his Paratime permit, and took one of his pets along. A Venusian nighthound.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf’s expression did not alter; it merely grew more intense. He used one of the short, semantically ugly terms which serve, in place of profanity, as the emotional release of a race that has forgotten all the taboos and terminologies of supernaturalistic religion and sex-inhibition.</p>
			<p>“You’re sure of this, of course.” It was less a question than a statement.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall bent and took cloth-wrapped objects from his bag, unwrapping them and laying them on the desk. They were casts, in hard black plastic, of the footprints of some large three-toed animal.</p>
			<p>“What do these look like, sir?” he asked.</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf fingered them and nodded. Then he became as visibly angry as a man of his civilization and culture-level ever permitted himself.</p>
			<p>“What does that fool think we have a Paratime Code for?” he demanded. “It’s entirely illegal to transpose any extraterrestrial animal or object to any timeline on which space-travel is unknown. I don’t care if he is a green-seal thavrad; he’ll face charges, when he gets back, for this!”</p>
			<p>“He <em>was</em> a green-seal thavrad,” Verkan Vall corrected. “And he won’t be coming back.”</p>
			<p>“I hope you didn’t have to deal summarily with him,” Tortha Karf said. “With his title, and social position, and his family’s political importance, that might make difficulties. Not that it wouldn’t be all right with me, of course, but we never seem to be able to make either the Management or the public realize the extremities to which we are forced, at times.” He sighed. “We probably never shall.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall smiled faintly. “Oh, no, sir; nothing like that. He was dead before I transposed to that timeline. He was killed when he wrecked a self-propelled vehicle he was using. One of those Fourth Level automobiles. I posed as a relative and tried to claim his body for the burial-ceremony observed on that cultural level, but was told that it had been completely destroyed by fire when the fuel tank of this automobile burned. I was given certain of his effects which had passed through the fire; I found his sigil concealed inside what appeared to be a cigarette case.” He took a green disk from the bag and laid it on the desk. “There’s no question; Gavran Sarn died in the wreck of that automobile.”</p>
			<p>“And the nighthound?”</p>
			<p>“It was in the car with him, but it escaped. You know how fast those things are. I found that track”⁠—he indicated one of the black casts⁠—“in some dried mud near the scene of the wreck. As you see, the cast is slightly defective. The others were fresh this morning, when I made them.”</p>
			<p>“And what have you done so far?”</p>
			<p>“I rented an old farm near the scene of the wreck, and installed my field-generator there. It runs through to the Hagraban Synthetics Works, about a hundred miles east of Thalna-Jarvizar. I have my this-line terminal in the girls’ rest room at the durable plastics factory; handled that on a local police-power writ. Since then, I’ve been hunting for the nighthound. I think I can find it, but I’ll need some special equipment, and a hypno-mech indoctrination. That’s why I came back.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Has it been attracting any attention?” Tortha Karf asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>“Killing cattle in the locality; causing considerable excitement. Fortunately, it’s a locality of forested mountains and valley farms, rather than a built-up industrial district. Local police and wild-game protection officers are concerned; all the farmers excited, and going armed. The theory is that it’s either a wildcat of some sort, or a maniac armed with a cutlass. Either theory would conform, more or less, to the nature of its depredations. Nobody has actually seen it.”</p>
			<p>“That’s good!” Tortha Karf was relieved. “Well, you’ll have to go and bring it out, or kill it and obliterate the body. You know why, as well as I do.”</p>
			<p>“Certainly, sir,” Verkan Vall replied. “In a primitive culture, things like this would be assigned supernatural explanations, and imbedded in the locally accepted religion. But this culture, while nominally religious, is highly rationalistic in practice. Typical lag-effect, characteristic of all expanding cultures. And this Europo-American Sector really has an expanding culture. A hundred and fifty years ago, the inhabitants of this particular timeline didn’t even know how to apply steam power; now they’ve begun to release nuclear energy, in a few crude forms.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf whistled, softly. “That’s quite a jump. There’s a sector that’ll be in for trouble, in the next few centuries.”</p>
			<p>“That is realized, locally, sir.” Verkan Vall concentrated on relighting his pipe, for a moment, then continued: “I would predict space-travel on that sector within the next century. Maybe the next half-century, at least to the Moon. And the art of taxidermy is very highly developed. Now, suppose some farmer shoots that thing; what would he do with it, sir?”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf grunted. “Nice logic, Vall. On a most uncomfortable possibility. He’d have it mounted, and it’d be put in a museum, somewhere. And as soon as the first spaceship reaches Venus, and they find those things in a wild state, they’ll have the mounted specimen identified.”</p>
			<p>“Exactly. And then, instead of beating their brains about <em>where</em> their specimen came from, they’ll begin asking <em>when</em> it came from. They’re quite capable of such reasoning, even now.”</p>
			<p>“A hundred years isn’t a particularly long time,” Tortha Karf considered. “I’ll be retired, then, but you’ll have my job, and it’ll be your headache. You’d better get this cleaned up, now, while it can be handled. What are you going to do?”</p>
			<p>“I’m not sure, now, sir. I want a hypno-mech indoctrination, first.” Verkan Vall gestured toward the communicator on the desk. “May I?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Certainly.” Tortha Karf slid the instrument across the desk. “Anything you want.”</p>
			<p>“Thank you, sir.” Verkan Vall snapped on the code-index, found the symbol he wanted, and then punched it on the keyboard. “Special Chief’s Assistant Verkan Vall,” he identified himself. “Speaking from office of Tortha Karf, Chief Paratime Police. I want a complete hypno-mech on Venusian nighthounds, emphasis on wild state, special emphasis domesticated nighthounds reverted to wild state in terrestrial surroundings, extra-special emphasis hunting techniques applicable to same. The word ‘nighthound’ will do for trigger-symbol.” He turned to Tortha Karf. “Can I take it here?”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf nodded, pointing to a row of booths along the far wall of the office.</p>
			<p>“Make setup for wired transmission; I’ll take it here.”</p>
			<p>“Very well, sir; in fifteen minutes,” a voice replied out of the communicator.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall slid the communicator back. “By the way, sir; I had a hitchhiker, on the way back. Carried him about a hundred or so parayears; picked him up about three hundred parayears after leaving my other-line terminal. Nasty-looking fellow, in a black uniform; looked like one of these private-army storm troopers you find all through that sector. Armed, and hostile. I thought I’d have to ray him, but he blundered outside the field almost at once. I have a record, if you’d care to see it.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, put it on,” Tortha Karf gestured toward the solidograph-projector. “It’s set for miniature reproduction here on the desk; that be all right?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded, getting out the film and loading it into the projector. When he pressed a button, a dome of radiance appeared on the desk top; two feet in width and a foot in height. In the middle of this appeared a small solidograph image of the interior of the conveyor, showing the desk, and the control board, and the figure of Verkan Vall seated at it. The little figure of the storm trooper appeared, pistol in hand. The little Verkan Vall snatched up his tiny needler; the storm trooper moved into one side of the dome and vanished.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall flipped a switch and cut out the image.</p>
			<p>“Yes. I don’t know what causes that, but it happens, now and then,” Tortha Karf said. “Usually at the beginning of a transposition. I remember, when I was just a kid, about a hundred and fifty years ago⁠—a hundred and thirty-nine, to be exact⁠—I picked up a fellow on the Fourth Level, just about where you’re operating, and dragged him a couple of hundred parayears. I went back to find him and return him to his own timeline, but before I could locate him, he’d been arrested by the local authorities as a suspicious character, and got himself shot trying to escape. I felt badly about that, but⁠—” Tortha Karf shrugged. “Anything else happen on the trip?”</p>
			<p>“I ran through a belt of intermittent nucleonic bombing on the Second Level.” Verkan Vall mentioned an approximate paratime location.</p>
			<p>“Aaagh! That Khiftan civilization⁠—by courtesy so called!” Tortha Karf pulled a wry face. “I suppose the intra-family enmities of the Hvadka Dynasty have reached critical mass again. They’ll fool around till they blast themselves back to the stone age.”</p>
			<p>“Intellectually, they’re about there, now. I had to operate in that sector, once⁠—Oh, yes, another thing, sir. This rifle.” Verkan Vall picked it up, emptied the magazine, and handed it to his superior. “The supplies office slipped up on this; it’s not appropriate to my line of operation. It’s a lovely rifle, but it’s about two hundred percent in advance of existing arms design on my line. It excited the curiosity of a couple of police officers and a game-protector, who should be familiar with the weapons of their own timeline. I evaded by disclaiming ownership or intimate knowledge, and they seemed satisfied, but it worried me.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. That was made in our duplicating shops, here in Dhergabar.” Tortha Karf carried it to a photographic bench, behind his desk. “I’ll have it checked, while you’re taking your hypno-mech. Want to exchange it for something authentic?”</p>
			<p>“Why, no, sir. It’s been identified to me, and I’d excite less suspicion with it than I would if I abandoned it and mysteriously acquired another rifle. I just wanted a check, and Supplies warned to be more careful in future.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf nodded approvingly. The young Mavrad of Nerros was thinking as a paratimer should.</p>
			<p>“What’s the designation of your line, again?”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall told him. It was a short numerical term of six places, but it expressed a number of the order of ten to the fortieth power, exact to the last digit. Tortha Karf repeated it into his stenomemograph, with explanatory comment.</p>
			<p>“There seems to be quite a few things going wrong, in that area,” he said. “Let’s see, now.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He punched the designation on a keyboard; instantly, it appeared on a translucent screen in front of him. He punched another combination, and, at the top of the screen, under the number, there appeared:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Events, Past Elapsed Five Years.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He punched again; below this line appeared the subheading:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>Events Involving Paratime Transposition.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Another code-combination added a third line:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>(Attracting Public Notice Among Inhabitants.)</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He pressed the start button; the headings vanished, to be replaced by page after page of print, succeeding one another on the screen as the two men read. They told strange and apparently disconnected stories⁠—of unexplained fires and explosions; of people vanishing without trace; of unaccountable disasters to aircraft. There were many stories of an epidemic of mysterious disk-shaped objects seen in the sky, singly or in numbers. To each account was appended one or more reference-numbers. Sometimes Tortha Karf or Verkan Vall would punch one of these, and read, on an adjoining screen, the explanatory matter referred to.</p>
			<p>Finally Tortha Karf leaned back and lit a fresh cigarette.</p>
			<p>“Yes, indeed, Vall; very definitely we will have to take action in the matter of the runaway nighthound of the late Gavran Sarn,” he said. “I’d forgotten that that was the timeline onto which the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Ardrath</i> expedition launched those antigrav disks. If this extraterrestrial monstrosity turns up, on the heels of that ‘Flying Saucer’ business, everybody above the order of intelligence of a cretin will suspect some connection.”</p>
			<p>“What really happened, in the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Ardrath</i> matter?” Verkan Vall inquired. “I was on the Third Level, on that Luvarian Empire operation, at the time.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right; you missed that. Well, it was one of these joint-operation things. The Paratime Commission and the Space Patrol were experimenting with a new technique for throwing a spaceship into paratime. They used the cruiser <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Ardrath</i>, Kalzarn Jann commanding. Went into space about halfway to the Moon and took up orbit, keeping on the sunlit side of the planet to avoid being observed. That was all right. But then, Captain Kalzarn ordered away a flight of antigrav disks, fully manned, to take pictures, and finally authorized a landing in the western mountain range, Northern Continent, Minor Landmass. That’s when the trouble started.”</p>
			<p>He flipped the run-back switch, till he had recovered the page he wanted. Verkan Vall read of a Fourth Level aviator, in his little airscrew-drive craft, sighting nine high-flying saucerlike objects.</p>
			<p>“That was how it began,” Tortha Karf told him. “Before long, as other incidents of the same sort occurred, our people on that line began sending back to know what was going on. Naturally, from the different descriptions of these ‘saucers,’ they recognized the objects as antigrav landing-disks from a spaceship. So I went to the Commission and raised atomic blazes about it, and the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Ardrath</i> was ordered to confine operations to the lower areas of the Fifth Level. Then our people on that timeline went to work with corrective action. Here.”</p>
			<p>He wiped the screen and then began punching combinations. Page after page appeared, bearing accounts of people who had claimed to have seen the mysterious disks, and each report was more fantastic than the last.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“The standard smother-out technique,” Verkan Vall grinned. “I only heard a little talk about the ‘Flying Saucers,’ and all of that was in joke. In that order of culture, you can always discredit one true story by setting up ten others, palpably false, parallel to it⁠—Wasn’t that the timeline the Tharmax Trading Corporation almost lost their paratime license on?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right; it was! They bought up all the cigarettes, and caused a conspicuous shortage, after Fourth Level cigarettes had been introduced on this line and had become popular. They should have spread their purchases over a number of lines, and kept them within the local supply-demand frame. And they also got into trouble with the local government for selling unrationed petrol and automobile tires. We had to send in a special-operations group, and they came closer to having to engage in outtime local politics than I care to think of.” Tortha Karf quoted a line from a currently popular song about the sorrows of a policeman’s life. “We’re jugglers, Vall; trying to keep our traders and sociological observers and tourists and plain idiots like the late Gavran Sarn out of trouble; trying to prevent panics and disturbances and dislocations of local economy as a result of our operations; trying to keep out of outtime politics⁠—and, at all times, at all costs and hazards, by all means, guarding the secret of paratime transposition. Sometimes I wish Ghaldron Karf and Hesthor Ghrom had strangled in their cradles!”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall shook his head. “No, chief,” he said. “You don’t mean that; not really,” he said. “We’ve been paratiming for the past ten thousand years. When the Ghaldron-Hesthor transtemporal field was discovered, our ancestors had pretty well exhausted the resources of this planet. We had a world population of half a billion, and it was all they could do to keep alive. After we began paratime transposition, our population climbed to ten billion, and there it stayed for the last eight thousand years. Just enough of us to enjoy our planet and the other planets of the system to the fullest; enough of everything for everybody that nobody needs fight anybody for anything. We’ve tapped the resources of those other worlds on other timelines, a little here, a little there, and not enough to really hurt anybody. We’ve left our mark in a few places⁠—the Dakota Badlands, and the Gobi, on the Fourth Level, for instance⁠—but we’ve done no great damage to any of them.”</p>
			<p>“Except the time they blew up half the Southern Island Continent, over about five hundred parayears on the Third Level,” Tortha Karf mentioned.</p>
			<p>“Regrettable accident, to be sure,” Verkan Vall conceded. “And look how much we’ve learned from the experiences of those other timelines. During the Crisis, after the Fourth Interplanetary War, we might have adopted Palnar Sarn’s ‘Dictatorship of the Chosen’ scheme, if we hadn’t seen what an exactly similar scheme had done to the Jak-Hakka Civilization, on the Second Level. When Palnar Sarn was told about that, he went into paratime to see for himself, and when he returned, he renounced his proposal in horror.”</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf nodded. He wouldn’t be making any mistake in turning his post over to the Mavrad of Nerros on his retirement.</p>
			<p>“Yes, Vall; I know,” he said. “But when you’ve been at this desk as long as I have, you’ll have a sour moment or two, now and then, too.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A blue light flashed over one of the booths across the room. Verkan Vall got to his feet, removing his coat and hanging it on the back of his chair, and crossed the room, rolling up his left shirt sleeve. There was a relaxer-chair in the booth, with a blue plastic helmet above it. He glanced at the indicator-screen to make sure he was getting the indoctrination he called for, and then sat down in the chair and lowered the helmet over his head, inserting the ear plugs and fastening the chin strap. Then he touched his left arm with an injector which was lying on the arm of the chair, and at the same time flipped the starter switch.</p>
			<p>Soft, slow music began to chant out of the earphones. The insidious fingers of the drug blocked off his senses, one by one. The music diminished, and the words of the hypnotic formula lulled him to sleep.</p>
			<p>He woke, hearing the lively strains of dance music. For a while, he lay relaxed. Then he snapped off the switch, took out the ear plugs, removed the helmet and rose to his feet. Deep in his subconscious mind was the entire body of knowledge about the Venusian nighthound. He mentally pronounced the word, and at once it began flooding into his conscious mind. He knew the animal’s evolutionary history, its anatomy, its characteristics, its dietary and reproductive habits, how it hunted, how it fought its enemies, how it eluded pursuit, and how best it could be tracked down and killed. He nodded. Already, a plan for dealing with Gavran Sarn’s renegade pet was taking shape in his mind.</p>
			<p>He picked a plastic cup from the dispenser, filled it from a cooler-tap with amber-colored spiced wine, and drank, tossing the cup into the disposal-bin. He placed a fresh injector on the arm of the chair, ready for the next user of the booth. Then he emerged, glancing at his Fourth Level wrist watch and mentally translating to the First Level time-scale. Three hours had passed; there had been more to learn about his quarry than he had expected.</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf was sitting behind his desk, smoking a cigarette. It seemed as though he had not moved since Verkan Vall had left him, though the special agent knew that he had dined, attended several conferences, and done many other things.</p>
			<p>“I checked up on your hitchhiker, Vall,” the chief said. “We won’t bother about him. He’s a member of something called the Christian Avengers⁠—one of those typical Europo-American race-and-religious hate groups. He belongs in a belt that is the outcome of the Hitler victory of 1940, whatever that was. Something unpleasant, I daresay. We don’t owe him anything; people of that sort should be stepped on, like cockroaches. And he won’t make any more trouble on the line where you dropped him than they have there already. It’s in a belt of complete social and political anarchy; somebody probably shot him as soon as he emerged, because he wasn’t wearing the right sort of a uniform. Nineteen-forty what, by the way?”</p>
			<p>“Elapsed years since the birth of some religious leader,” Verkan Vall explained. “And did you find out about my rifle?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes. It’s reproduction of something that’s called a Sharp’s Model ’37 .235 Ultraspeed-Express. Made on an adjoining paratime belt by a company that went out of business sixty-seven years ago, elapsed time, on your line of operation. What made the difference was the Second War Between The States. I don’t know what that was, either⁠—I’m not too well up on Fourth Level history⁠—but whatever, your line of operation didn’t have it. Probably just as well for them, though they very likely had something else, as bad or worse. I put in a complaint to Supplies about it, and got you some more ammunition and reloading tools. Now, tell me what you’re going to do about this nighthound business.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Tortha Karf was silent for a while, after Verkan Vall had finished.</p>
			<p>“You’re taking some awful chances, Vall,” he said, at length. “The way you plan doing it, the advantages will all be with the nighthound. Those things can see as well at night as you can in daylight. I suppose you know that, though; you’re the nighthound specialist, now.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. But they’re accustomed to the Venus hotland marshes; it’s been dry weather for the last two weeks, all over the northeastern section of the Northern Continent. I’ll be able to hear it, long before it gets close to me. And I’ll be wearing an electric headlamp. When I snap that on, it’ll be dazzled, for a moment.”</p>
			<p>“Well, as I said, you’re the nighthound specialist. There’s the communicator; order anything you need.” He lit a fresh cigarette from the end of the old one before crushing it out. “But be careful, Vall. It took me close to forty years to make a paratimer out of you; I don’t want to have to repeat the process with somebody else before I can retire.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The grass was wet as Verkan Vall⁠—who reminded himself that here he was called Richard Lee⁠—crossed the yard from the farmhouse to the ramshackle barn, in the early autumn darkness. It had been raining that morning when the strato-rocket from Dhergabar had landed him at the Hagraban Synthetics Works, on the First Level; unaffected by the probabilities of human history, the same rain had been coming down on the old Kinchwalter farm, near Rutter’s Fort, on the Fourth Level. And it had persisted all day, in a slow, deliberate drizzle.</p>
			<p>He didn’t like that. The woods would be wet, muffling his quarry’s footsteps, and canceling his only advantage over the night-prowler he hunted. He had no idea, however, of postponing the hunt. If anything, the rain had made it all the more imperative that the nighthound be killed at once. At this season, a falling temperature would speedily follow. The nighthound, a creature of the hot Venus marshes, would suffer from the cold, and, taught by years of domestication to find warmth among human habitations, it would invade some isolated farmhouse, or, worse, one of the little valley villages. If it were not killed tonight, the incident he had come to prevent would certainly occur.</p>
			<p>Going to the barn, he spread an old horse blanket on the seat of the jeep, laid his rifle on it, and then backed the jeep outside. Then he took off his coat, removing his pipe and tobacco from the pockets, and spread it on the wet grass. He unwrapped a package and took out a small plastic spraygun he had brought with him from the First Level, aiming it at the coat and pressing the trigger until it blew itself empty. A sickening, rancid fetor tainted the air⁠—the scent of the giant poison-roach of Venus, the one creature for which the nighthound bore an inborn, implacable hatred. It was because of this compulsive urge to attack and kill the deadly poison-roach that the first human settlers on Venus, long millennia ago, had domesticated the ugly and savage nighthound. He remembered that the Gavran family derived their title from their vast Venus hotlands estates; that Gavran Sarn, the man who had brought this thing to the Fourth Level, had been born on the inner planet. When Verkan Vall donned that coat, he would become his own living bait for the murderous fury of the creature he sought. At the moment, mastering his queasiness and putting on the coat, he objected less to that danger than to the hideous stench of the scent, to obtain which a valuable specimen had been sacrificed at the Dhergabar Museum of Extraterrestrial Zoology, the evening before.</p>
			<p>Carrying the wrapper and the spraygun to an outside fireplace, he snapped his lighter to them and tossed them in. They were highly inflammable, blazing up and vanishing in a moment. He tested the electric headlamp on the front of his cap; checked his rifle; drew the heavy revolver, an authentic product of his line of operation, and flipped the cylinder out and in again. Then he got into the jeep and drove away.</p>
			<p>For half an hour, he drove quickly along the valley roads. Now and then, he passed farmhouses, and dogs, puzzled and angered by the alien scent his coat bore, barked furiously. At length, he turned into a back road, and from this to the barely discernible trace of an old log road. The rain had stopped, and, in order to be ready to fire in any direction at any time, he had removed the top of the jeep. Now he had to crouch below the windshield to avoid overhanging branches. Once three deer⁠—a buck and two does⁠—stopped in front of him and stared for a moment, then bounded away with a flutter of white tails.</p>
			<p>He was driving slowly, now; laying behind him a reeking trail of scent. There had been another stock-killing, the night before, while he had been on the First Level. The locality of this latest depredation had confirmed his estimate of the beast’s probable movements, and indicated where it might be prowling, tonight. He was certain that it was somewhere near; sooner or later, it would pick up the scent.</p>
			<p>Finally, he stopped, snapping out his lights. He had chosen this spot carefully, while studying the Geological Survey map, that afternoon; he was on the grade of an old railroad line, now abandoned and its track long removed, which had served the logging operations of fifty years ago. On one side, the mountain slanted sharply upward; on the other, it fell away sharply. If the nighthound were below him, it would have to climb that forty-five degree slope, and could not avoid dislodging loose stones, or otherwise making a noise. He would get out on that side; if the nighthound were above him, the jeep would protect him when it charged. He got to the ground, thumbing off the safety of his rifle, and an instant later he knew that he had made a mistake which could easily cost him his life; a mistake from which neither his comprehensive logic nor his hypnotically acquired knowledge of the beast’s habits had saved him.</p>
			<p>As he stepped to the ground, facing toward the front of the jeep, he heard a low, whining cry behind him, and a rush of padded feet. He whirled, snapping on the headlamp with his left hand and thrusting out his rifle pistol-wise in his right. For a split second, he saw the charging animal, its long, lizardlike head split in a toothy grin, its talon-tipped forepaws extended.</p>
			<p>He fired, and the bullet went wild. The next instant, the rifle was knocked from his hand. Instinctively, he flung up his left arm to shield his eyes. Claws raked his left arm and shoulder, something struck him heavily along the left side, and his cap-light went out as he dropped and rolled under the jeep, drawing in his legs and fumbling under his coat for the revolver.</p>
			<p>In that instant, he knew what had gone wrong. His plan had been entirely too much of a success. The nighthound had winded him as he had driven up the old railroad-grade, and had followed. Its best running speed had been just good enough to keep it a hundred or so feet behind the jeep, and the motor-noise had covered the padding of its feet. In the few moments between stopping the little car and getting out, the nighthound had been able to close the distance and spring upon him.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was characteristic of First-Level mentality that Verkan Vall wasted no moments on self-reproach or panic. While he was still rolling under his jeep, his mind had been busy with plans to retrieve the situation. Something touched the heel of one boot, and he froze his leg into immobility, at the same time trying to get the big Smith &amp; Wesson free. The shoulder-holster, he found, was badly torn, though made of the heaviest skirting-leather, and the spring which retained the weapon in place had been wrenched and bent until he needed both hands to draw. The eight-inch slashing-claw of the nighthound’s right intermediary limb had raked him; only the instinctive motion of throwing up his arm, and the fact that he wore the revolver in a shoulder-holster, had saved his life.</p>
			<p>The nighthound was prowling around the jeep, whining frantically. It was badly confused. It could see quite well, even in the close darkness of the starless night; its eyes were of a nature capable of perceiving infrared radiations as light. There were plenty of these; the jeep’s engine, lately running on four-wheel drive, was quite hot. Had he been standing alone, especially on this raw, chilly night, Verkan Vall’s own body-heat would have lighted him up like a jack-o’-lantern. Now, however, the hot engine above him masked his own radiations. Moreover, the poison-roach scent on his coat was coming up through the floor board and mingling with the scent on the seat, yet the nighthound couldn’t find the two-and-a-half foot insectlike thing that should have been producing it. Verkan Vall lay motionless, wondering how long the next move would be in coming. Then he heard a thud above him, followed by a furious tearing as the nighthound ripped the blanket and began rending at the seat cushion.</p>
			<p>“Hope it gets a paw-full of seat-springs,” Verkan Vall commented mentally. He had already found a stone about the size of his two fists, and another slightly smaller, and had put one in each of the side pockets of the coat. Now he slipped his revolver into his waist-belt and writhed out of the coat, shedding the ruined shoulder-holster at the same time. Wriggling on the flat of his back, he squirmed between the rear wheels, until he was able to sit up, behind the jeep. Then, swinging the weighted coat, he flung it forward, over the nighthound and the jeep itself, at the same time drawing his revolver.</p>
			<p>Immediately, the nighthound, lured by the sudden movement of the principal source of the scent, jumped out of the jeep and bounded after the coat, and there was considerable noise in the brush on the lower side of the railroad grade. At once, Verkan Vall swarmed into the jeep and snapped on the lights.</p>
			<p>His stratagem had succeeded beautifully. The stinking coat had landed on the top of a small bush, about ten feet in front of the jeep and ten feet from the ground. The nighthound, erect on its haunches, was reaching out with its front paws to drag it down, and slashing angrily at it with its single-clawed intermediary limbs. Its back was to Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>His sights clearly defined by the lights in front of him, the paratimer centered them on the base of the creature’s spine, just above its secondary shoulders, and carefully squeezed the trigger. The big .357 Magnum bucked in his hand and belched flame and sound⁠—if only these Fourth Level weapons weren’t so confoundedly boisterous!⁠—and the nighthound screamed and fell. Recocking the revolver, Verkan Vall waited for an instant, then nodded in satisfaction. The beast’s spine had been smashed, and its hind quarters, and even its intermediary fighting limbs had been paralyzed. He aimed carefully for a second shot and fired into the base of the thing’s skull. It quivered and died.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Getting a flashlight, he found his rifle, sticking muzzle-down in the mud a little behind and to the right of the jeep, and swore briefly in the local Fourth Level idiom, for Verkan Vall was a man who loved good weapons, be they sigma-ray needlers, neutron-disruption blasters, or the solid-missile projectors of the lower levels. By this time, he was feeling considerable pain from the claw-wounds he had received. He peeled off his shirt and tossed it over the hood of the jeep.</p>
			<p>Tortha Karf had advised him to carry a needler, or a blaster, or a neurostat-gun, but Verkan Vall had been unwilling to take such arms onto the Fourth Level. In event of mishap to himself, it would be all too easy for such a weapon to fall into the hands of someone able to deduce from it scientific principles too far in advance of the general Fourth Level culture. But there had been one First Level item which he had permitted himself, mainly because, suitably packaged, it was not readily identifiable as such. Digging a respectable Fourth-Level leatherette case from under the seat, he opened it and took out a pint bottle with a red poison-label, and a towel. Saturating the towel with the contents of the bottle, he rubbed every inch of his torso with it, so as not to miss even the smallest break made in his skin by the septic claws of the nighthound. Whenever the lotion-soaked towel touched raw skin, a pain like the burn of a hot iron shot through him; before he was through, he was in agony. Satisfied that he had disinfected every wound, he dropped the towel and clung weakly to the side of the jeep. He grunted out a string of English oaths, and capped them with an obscene Spanish blasphemy he had picked up among the Fourth Level inhabitants of his island home of Nerros, to the south, and a thundering curse in the name of Mogga, Fire-God of Dool, in a Third-Level tongue. He mentioned Fasif, Great God of Khift, in a manner which would have got him an acid-bath if the Khiftan priests had heard him. He alluded to the baroque amatory practices of the Third-Level Illyalla people, and soothed himself, in the classical Dar-Halma tongue, with one of those rambling genealogical insults favored in the Indo-Turanian Sector of the Fourth Level.</p>
			<p>By this time, the pain had subsided to an overall smarting itch. He’d have to bear with that until his work was finished and he could enjoy a hot bath. He got another bottle out of the first-aid kit⁠—a flat pint, labeled “Old Overholt,” containing a locally-manufactured specific for inward and subjective wounds⁠—and medicated himself copiously from it, corking it and slipping it into his hip pocket against future need. He gathered up the ruined shoulder-holster and threw it under the back seat. He put on his shirt. Then he went and dragged the dead nighthound onto the grade by its stumpy tail.</p>
			<p>It was an ugly thing, weighing close to two hundred pounds, with powerfully muscled hind legs which furnished the bulk of its motive-power, and sturdy three-clawed front legs. Its secondary limbs, about a third of the way back from its front shoulders, were long and slender; normally, they were carried folded closely against the body, and each was armed with a single curving claw. The revolver-bullet had gone in at the base of the skull and emerged under the jaw; the head was relatively undamaged. Verkan Vall was glad of that; he wanted that head for the trophy-room of his home on Nerros. Grunting and straining, he got the thing into the back of the jeep, and flung his almost shredded tweed coat over it.</p>
			<p>A last look around assured him that he had left nothing unaccountable or suspicious. The brush was broken where the nighthound had been tearing at the coat; a bear might have done that. There were splashes of the viscid stuff the thing had used for blood, but they wouldn’t be there long. Terrestrial rodents liked nighthound blood, and the woods were full of mice. He climbed in under the wheel, backed, turned, and drove away.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Inside the paratime-transposition dome, Verkan Vall turned from the body of the nighthound, which he had just dragged in, and considered the inert form of another animal⁠—a stump-tailed, tuft-eared, tawny Canada lynx. That particular animal had already made two paratime transpositions; captured in the vast wilderness of Fifth-Level North America, it had been taken to the First Level and placed in the Dhergabar Zoological Gardens, and then, requisitioned on the authority of Tortha Karf, it had been brought to the Fourth Level by Verkan Vall. It was almost at the end of all its travels.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall prodded the supine animal with the toe of his boot; it twitched slightly. Its feet were cross-bound with straps, but when he saw that the narcotic was wearing off, Verkan Vall snatched a syringe, parted the fur at the base of its neck, and gave it an injection. After a moment, he picked it up in his arms and carried it out to the jeep.</p>
			<p>“All right, pussy cat,” he said, placing it under the rear seat, “this is the one-way ride. The way you’re doped up, it won’t hurt a bit.”</p>
			<p>He went back and rummaged in the debris of the long-deserted barn. He picked up a hoe, and discarded it as too light. An old plowshare was too unhandy. He considered a grate-bar from a heating furnace, and then he found the poleax, lying among a pile of wormeaten boards. Its handle had been shortened, at some time, to about twelve inches, converting it into a heavy hatchet. He weighed it, and tried it on a block of wood, and then, making sure that the secret door was closed, he went out again and drove off.</p>
			<p>An hour later, he returned. Opening the secret door, he carried the ruined shoulder holster, and the straps that had bound the bobcat’s feet, and the ax, now splotched with blood and tawny cat-hairs, into the dome. Then he closed the secret room, and took a long drink from the bottle on his hip.</p>
			<p>The job was done. He would take a hot bath, and sleep in the farmhouse till noon, and then he would return to the First Level. Maybe Tortha Karf would want him to come back here for a while. The situation on this timeline was far from satisfactory, even if the crisis threatened by Gavran Sarn’s renegade pet had been averted. The presence of a chief’s assistant might be desirable.</p>
			<p>At least, he had a right to expect a short vacation. He thought of the little redhead at the Hagraban Synthetics Works. What was her name? Something Kara⁠—Morvan Kara; that was it. She’d be coming off shift about the time he’d make First Level, tomorrow afternoon.</p>
			<p>The claw-wounds were still smarting vexatiously. A hot bath, and a night’s sleep⁠—He took another drink, lit his pipe, picked up his rifle and started across the yard to the house.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Private Zinkowski cradled the telephone and got up from the desk, stretching. He left the orderly-room and walked across the hall to the recreation room, where the rest of the boys were loafing. Sergeant Haines, in a languid gin-rummy game with Corporal Conner, a sheriff’s deputy, and a mechanic from the service station down the road, looked up.</p>
			<p>“Well, Sarge, I think we can write off those stock-killings,” the private said.</p>
			<p>“Yeah?” The sergeant’s interest quickened.</p>
			<p>“Yeah. I think the whatzit’s had it. I just got a buzz from the railroad cops at Logansport. It seems a track-walker found a dead bobcat on the Logan River branch, about a mile or so below <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">M.M.Y.</abbr> signal tower. Looks like it tangled with that night freight upriver, and came off second best. It was near chopped to hamburger.”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">M.M.Y.</abbr> signal tower; that’s right below Yoder’s Crossing,” the sergeant considered. “The Strawmyer farm night-before-last, the Amrine farm last night⁠—Yeah, that would be about right.”</p>
			<p>“That’ll suit Steve Parker; bobcats aren’t protected, so it’s not his trouble. And they’re not a violation of state law, so it’s none of our worry,” Conner said. “Your deal, isn’t it, Sarge?”</p>
			<p>“Yeah. Wait a minute.” The sergeant got to his feet. “I promised Sam Kane, the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">A.P.</abbr> man at Logansport, that I’d let him in on anything new.” He got up and started for the phone. “Phantom Killer!” He blew an impolite noise.</p>
			<p>“Well, it was a lot of excitement, while it lasted,” the deputy sheriff said. “Just like that Flying Saucer thing.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Rebel Raider</h2>
			<p>It was almost midnight, on <time datetime="1863-01-02">January 2, 1863</time>, and the impromptu party at the Ratcliffe home was breaking up. The guest of honor, General <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. E. B.</abbr> Stuart, felt that he was overstaying his welcome⁠—not at the Ratcliffe home, where everybody was soundly Confederate, but in Fairfax County, then occupied by the Union Army.</p>
			<p>About a week before, he had come raiding up from Culpepper with a strong force of cavalry, to spend a merry Christmas in northern Virginia and give the enemy a busy if somewhat less than happy New Year’s. He had shot up outposts, run off horses from remount stations, plundered supply depots, burned stores of forage; now, before returning to the main Confederate Army, he had paused to visit his friend Laura Ratcliffe. And, of course, there had been a party. There was always a party when Jeb Stuart was in any one place long enough to organize one.</p>
			<p>They were all crowding into the hallway⁠—the officers of Stuart’s staff, receiving their hats and cloaks from the servants and buckling on their weapons; the young ladies, their gay dresses showing only the first traces of wartime shabbiness; the matrons who chaperoned them; Stuart himself, the center of attention, with his hostess on his arm.</p>
			<p>“It’s a shame you can’t stay longer, General,” Laura Ratcliffe was saying. “It’s hard on us, living in conquered territory, under enemy rule.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I won’t desert you entirely, Miss Ratcliffe,” Stuart told her. “I’m returning to Culpepper in the morning, as you know, but I mean to leave Captain Mosby behind with a few men, to look after the loyal Confederate people here until we can return in force and in victory.”</p>
			<p>Hearing his name, one of the men in gray turned, his hands raised to hook the fastening at the throat of his cloak. Just four days short of his thirtieth birthday, he looked even more youthful; he was considerably below average height, and so slender as to give the impression of frailness. His hair and the beard he was wearing at the time were very light brown. He wore an officer’s uniform without insignia of rank, and instead of a saber he carried a pair of 1860-model Colt .44’s on his belt, with the butts to the front so that either revolver could be drawn with either hand, backhand or crossbody.</p>
			<p>There was more than a touch of the dandy about him. The cloak he was fastening was lined with scarlet silk and the gray cock-brimmed hat the slave was holding for him was plumed with a squirrel tail. At first glance he seemed no more than one of the many young gentlemen of the planter class serving in the Confederate cavalry. But then one looked into his eyes and got the illusion of being covered by a pair of blued pistol muzzles. He had an aura of combined ruthlessness, self confidence, good humor and impudent audacity.</p>
			<p>For an instant he stood looking inquiringly at the general. Then he realized what Stuart had said, and the blue eyes sparkled. This was the thing he had almost given up hoping for⁠—an independent command and a chance to operate in the enemy’s rear.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>In 1855, John Singleton Mosby, newly graduated from the University of Virginia, had opened a law office at Bristol, Washington County, Virginia, and a year later he had married.</p>
			<p>The son of a well-to-do farmer and slave-owner, his boyhood had been devoted to outdoor sports, especially hunting, and he was accounted an expert horseman and a dead shot, even in a society in which skill with guns and horses was taken for granted. Otherwise, the outbreak of the war had found him without military qualifications and completely uninterested in military matters. Moreover, he had been a rabid anti-secessionist.</p>
			<p>It must be remembered, however, that, like most Southerners, he regarded secession as an entirely local issue, to be settled by the people of each state for themselves. He took no exception to the position that a state had the constitutional right to sever its connection with the Union if its people so desired. His objection to secession was based upon what he considered to be political logic. He realized that, once begun, secession was a process which could only end in reducing America to a cluster of impotent petty sovereignties, torn by hostilities, incapable of any concerted action, a fair prey to any outside aggressor.</p>
			<p>However, he was also a believer in the paramount sovereignty of the states. He was first of all a Virginian. So, when Virginia voted in favor of secession, Mosby, while he deplored the choice, felt that he had no alternative but to accept it. He promptly enlisted in a locally organized cavalry company, the Washington Mounted Rifles, under a former <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.</abbr> officer and West Point graduate, William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">E.</abbr> Jones.</p>
			<p>His letters to his wife told of his early military experiences⁠—his pleasure at receiving one of the fine new Sharps carbines which Captain Jones had wangled for his company, and, later, a Colt .44 revolver: his first taste of fire in the Shenandoah Valley, where the company, now incorporated into Colonel Stuart’s First Virginia Cavalry, were covering Johnston’s march to reinforce Beauregard: his rather passive participation in the big battle at Manassas. He was keenly disappointed at being held in reserve throughout the fighting. Long afterward, it was to be his expressed opinion that the Confederacy had lost the war by failing to follow the initial victory and exploit the rout of McDowell’s army.</p>
			<p>The remainder of 1861 saw him doing picket duty in Fairfax County. When Stuart was promoted to brigadier general, and Captain Jones took his place as colonel of the First Virginia, Mosby became the latter’s adjutant. There should have been a commission along with this post, but this seems to have been snarled in red tape at Richmond and never came through. It was about this time that Mosby first came to Stuart’s personal attention. Mosby spent a night at headquarters after escorting a couple of young ladies who had been living outside the Confederate lines and were anxious to reach relatives living farther south.</p>
			<p>Stuart had been quite favorably impressed with Mosby, and when, some time later, the latter lost his place as adjutant of the First by reason of Jones’ promotion to brigadier general and Fitzhugh Lee’s taking over the regiment, Mosby became one of Stuart’s headquarters scouts.</p>
			<p>Scouting for Jeb Stuart was not the easiest work in the world, nor the safest, but Mosby appears to have enjoyed it, and certainly made good at it. It was he who scouted the route for Stuart’s celebrated “Ride Around MacClellan” in June, 1862, an exploit which brought his name to the favorable attention of General Lee. By this time, still without commission, he was accepted at Stuart’s headquarters as a sort of courtesy officer, and generally addressed as “Captain” Mosby. Stuart made several efforts to get him commissioned, but War Department red tape seems to have blocked all of them. By this time, too, Mosby had become convinced of the utter worthlessness of the saber as a cavalryman’s weapon, and for his own armament adopted a pair of Colts.</p>
			<p>The revolver of the Civil War was, of course, a percussion-cap weapon. Even with the powder and bullet contained in a combustible paper cartridge, loading such an arm was a slow process: each bullet had to be forced in the front of the chamber on top of its propellant charge by means of a hinged rammer under the barrel, and a tiny copper cap had to be placed on each nipple. It was nothing to attempt on a prancing horse. The Union cavalryman was armed with a single-shot carbine⁠—the seven-shot Spencer repeater was not to make its battlefield appearance until late in 1863⁠—and one revolver, giving him a total of seven shots without reloading. With a pair of six-shooters, Mosby had a five-shot advantage over any opponent he was likely to encounter. As he saw it, tactical strength lay in the number of shots which could be delivered without reloading, rather than in the number of men firing them. Once he reached a position of independent command, he was to adhere consistently to this principle.</p>
			<p>On <time datetime="1862-07-14">July 14, 1862</time>, General John Pope, who had taken over a newly created Union Army made up of the commands of McDowell, Banks and Fremont, issued a bombastic and tactless order to his new command, making invidious comparisons between the armies in the west and those in the east. He said, “I hear constantly of ‘taking strong positions and holding them,’ of ‘lines of retreat,’ and of ‘bases of supplies.’ Let us discard all such ideas. Let us study the probable lines of retreat of our opponents, and leave our own to take care of themselves.”</p>
			<p>That intrigued Mosby. If General Pope wasn’t going to take care of his own rear, somebody ought to do it for him, and who better than John Mosby? He went promptly to Stuart, pointing out Pope’s disinterest in his own lines of supply and communication, and asked that he be given about twenty men and detailed to get into Pope’s rear and see what sort of disturbance he could create.</p>
			<p>Stuart doubted the propriety of sending men into what was then Stonewall Jackson’s territory, but he gave Mosby a letter to Jackson, recommending the bearer highly and outlining what he proposed doing, with the request that he be given some men to try it. With this letter, Mosby set out for Jackson’s headquarters.</p>
			<p>He never reached his destination. On the way, he was taken prisoner by a raiding force of New York cavalry, and arrived, instead, at Old Capitol jail in Washington. Stuart requested his exchange at once, and Mosby spent only about ten days in Old Capitol, and then was sent down the Potomac on an exchange boat, along with a number of other prisoners of war, for Hampton Roads.</p>
			<p>The boatload of prisoners, about to be exchanged and returned to their own army, were allowed to pass through a busy port of military embarkation and debarkation, with every opportunity to observe everything that was going on, and, to make a bad matter worse, the steamboat captain was himself a Confederate sympathizer. So when Mosby, from the exchange boat, observed a number of transports lying at anchor, he had no trouble at all in learning that they carried Burnside’s men, newly brought north from the Carolinas. With the help of the steamboat captain, Mosby was able to learn that the transports were bound for Acquia Creek, on the Potomac; that meant that the reinforcements were for Pope.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>As soon as he was exchanged, Mosby made all haste for Lee’s headquarters to report what he had discovered. Lee, remembering Mosby as the man who had scouted ahead of Stuart’s Ride Around MacClellan, knew that he had a hot bit of information from a credible source. A dispatch rider was started off at once for Jackson, and Jackson struck Pope at Cedar Mountain before he could be reinforced. Mosby returned to Stuart’s headquarters, losing no time in promoting a pair of .44’s to replace the ones lost when captured, and found his stock with Stuart at an all-time high as a result of his recent feat of espionage while in the hands of the enemy.</p>
			<p>So he was with Stuart when Stuart stopped at Laura Ratcliffe’s home, and was on hand when Stuart wanted to make one of his characteristic gestures of gallantry. And so he finally got his independent command⁠—all of six men⁠—and orders to operate in the enemy’s rear.</p>
			<p>Whatever Stuart might have had in mind in leaving him behind “to look after the loyal Confederate people,” John Mosby had no intention of posting himself in Laura Ratcliffe’s front yard as a guard of honor. He had a theory of guerrilla warfare which he wanted to test. In part, it derived from his experiences in the Shenandoah Valley and in Fairfax County, but in larger part, it was based upon his own understanding of the fundamental nature of war.</p>
			<p>The majority of guerrilla leaders have always been severely tactical in their thinking. That is to say, they have been concerned almost exclusively with immediate results. A troop column is ambushed, a picket post attacked, or a supply dump destroyed for the sake of the immediate loss of personnel or materiel so inflicted upon the enemy. Mosby, however, had a well-conceived strategic theory. He knew, in view of the magnitude of the war, that the tactical effects of his operations would simply be lost in the overall picture. But, if he could create enough uproar in the Union rear, he believed that he could force the withdrawal from the front of a regiment or even a brigade to guard against his attacks and, in some future battle, the absence of that regiment or brigade might tip the scale of battle or, at least, make some future Confederate victory more complete or some defeat less crushing.</p>
			<p>As soon as Stuart’s column started southward, Mosby took his six men across Bull Run Mountain to Middleburg, where he ordered them to scatter out, billet themselves at outlying farms, and meet him at the Middleburg hotel on the night of January 10. Meanwhile he returned alone to Fairfax County, spending the next week making contacts with the people and gathering information.</p>
			<p>On the night of Saturday, January 10, he took his men through the gap at Aldie and into Fairfax County. His first stop was at a farmhouse near Herndon Station, where he had friends, and there he met a woodsman, trapper and market hunter named John Underwood, who, with his two brothers, had been carrying on a private resistance movement against the Union occupation ever since the Confederate Army had moved out of the region. Overjoyed at the presence of regular Confederate troops, even as few as a half-dozen, Underwood offered to guide Mosby to a nearby Union picket post.</p>
			<p>Capturing this post was no particularly spectacular feat of arms. Mosby’s party dismounted about 200 yards away from it and crept up on it, to find seven members of the Fifth New York squatting around a fire, smoking, drinking coffee and trying to keep warm. Their first intimation of the presence of any enemy nearer than the Rappahannock River came when Mosby and his men sprang to their feet, leveled revolvers and demanded their surrender. One cavalryman made a grab for his carbine and Mosby shot him; the others put up their hands. The wounded man was given first aid, wrapped in a blanket and placed beside the fire to wait until the post would be relieved. The others were mounted on their own horses and taken to Middleburg, where they were paroled <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr>, released after they gave their word not to take up arms again against the Confederacy. This not entirely satisfactory handling of prisoners was the only means left open to Mosby with his small force, behind enemy lines.</p>
			<p>The next night, Mosby stayed out of Fairfax County to allow the excitement to die down a little, but the night after, he and his men, accompanied by Underwood, raided a post where the Little River Turnpike crossed Cub Run. Then, after picking up a two-man road patrol en route, they raided another post near Fryingpan Church. This time they brought back fourteen prisoners and horses.</p>
			<p>In all, he and his sextet had captured nineteen prisoners and twenty horses. But Mosby still wasn’t satisfied. What he wanted was a few more men and orders to operate behind the Union army on a permanent basis. So, after paroling the catch of the night before, he told John Underwood to get busy gathering information and establishing contacts, and he took his six men back to Culpepper, reporting his activities to Stuart and claiming that under his existing orders he had not felt justified in staying away from the army longer. At the same time, he asked for a larger detail and orders to continue operating in northern Virginia.</p>
			<p>In doing so, he knew he was taking a chance that Stuart would keep him at Culpepper, but as both armies had gone into winter quarters after Fredericksburg with only a minimum of outpost activity, he reasoned that Stuart would be willing to send him back. As it happened, Stuart was so delighted with the success of Mosby’s brief activity that he gave him fifteen men, all from the First Virginia Cavalry, and orders to operate until recalled. On January 18, Mosby was back at Middleburg, ready to go to work in earnest.</p>
			<p>As before, he scattered his men over the countryside, quartering them on the people. This time, before scattering them, he told them to meet him at Zion Church, just beyond the gap at Aldie, on the night of the 28th. During the intervening ten days, he was not only busy gathering information but also in an intensive recruiting campaign among the people of upper Fauquier and lower Loudoun Counties.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>In this last, his best selling-point was a recent act of the Confederate States Congress called the Scott Partisan Ranger Law. This piece of legislation was, in effect, an extension of the principles of prize law and privateering to land warfare. It authorized the formation of independent cavalry companies, to be considered part of the armed forces of the Confederacy, their members to serve without pay and mount themselves, in return for which they were to be entitled to keep any spoil of war captured from the enemy. The terms “enemy” and “spoil of war” were defined so liberally as to cover almost anything not the property of the government or citizens of the Confederacy. There were provisions, also, entitling partisan companies to draw on the Confederate government for arms and ammunition and permitting them to turn in and receive payment for any spoil which they did not wish to keep for themselves.</p>
			<p>The law had met with considerable opposition from the Confederate military authorities, who claimed that it would attract men and horses away from the regular service and into ineffective freebooting. There is no doubt that a number of independent companies organized under the Scott Law accomplished nothing of military value. Some degenerated into mere bandit gangs, full of deserters from both sides, and terrible only to the unfortunate Confederate citizens living within their range of operations. On the other hand, as Mosby was to demonstrate, a properly employed partisan company could be of considerable use.</p>
			<p>It was the provision about booty, however, which appealed to Mosby. As he intended operating in the Union rear, where the richest plunder could be found, he hoped that the prospect would attract numerous recruits. The countryside contained many men capable of bearing arms who had remained at home to look after their farms but who would be more than willing to ride with him now and then in hope of securing a new horse for farm work, or some needed harness, or food and blankets for their families. The regular Mosby Men called them the “Conglomerates,” and Mosby himself once said that they resembled the Democrat party, being “held together only by the cohesive power of public plunder.”</p>
			<p>Mosby’s first operation with his new force was in the pattern of the other two⁠—the stealthy dismounted approach and sudden surprise of an isolated picket post. He brought back eleven prisoners and twelve horses and sets of small arms, and, as on the night of the 10th, left one wounded enemy behind. As on the previous occasions, the prisoners were taken as far as Middleburg before being released on parole.</p>
			<p>For this reason, Mosby was sure that Colonel Sir Percy Wyndham, commander of the brigade which included the Fifth New York, Eighteenth Pennsylvania and the First Vermont, would assume that this village was the raiders’ headquarters. Colonel Wyndham, a European-trained soldier, would scarcely conceive of any military force, however small, without a regular headquarters and a fixed camp. Therefore, Wyndham would come looking for him at Middleburg. So, with a companion named Fountain Beattie, Mosby put up for what remained of the night at the home of a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Lorman Chancellor, on the road from Aldie a few miles east of Middleburg. The rest of the company were ordered to stay outside Middleburg.</p>
			<p>Mosby’s estimate of his opponent was uncannily accurate. The next morning, about daybreak, he and Beattie were wakened by one of the Chancellor servants and warned that a large body of Union cavalry was approaching up the road from Aldie. Peering through the window shutters, they watched about 200 men of the Fifth New York ride by, with Colonel Wyndham himself in the lead. As soon as they were out of sight up the road, Mosby and Beattie, who had hastily dressed, dashed downstairs for their horses.</p>
			<p>“I’m going to keep an eye on these people,” Mosby told Beattie. “Gather up as many men as you can, and meet me in about half an hour on the hill above Middleburg. But hurry! I’d rather have five men now than a hundred by noon.”</p>
			<p>When Beattie with six men rejoined Mosby, he found the latter sitting on a stump, munching an apple and watching the enemy through his field glasses. Wyndham, who had been searching Middleburg for “Mosby’s headquarters,” was just forming his men for a push on to Upperville, where he had been assured by the canny Middleburgers that Mosby had his camp.</p>
			<p>Mosby and his men cantered down the hillside to the road as Wyndham’s force moved out of the village and then broke into a mad gallop to overtake them.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was always hard to be sure whether jackets were dirty gray or faded blue. As the Union soldier had a not unfounded belief that the Virginia woods were swarming with bushwhackers (Confederate guerillas), the haste of a few men left behind to rejoin the column was quite understandable. The rearguard pulled up and waited for them. Then, at about twenty yards’ range, one of the New Yorkers, a sergeant, realized what was happening and shouted a warning:</p>
			<p>“They’re Rebs!”</p>
			<p>Instantly one of Mosby’s men, Ned Hurst, shot him dead. Other revolvers, ready drawn, banged, and several Union cavalrymen were wounded. Mosby and his followers hastily snatched the bridles of three others, disarmed them and turned, galloping away with them.</p>
			<p>By this time, the main column, which had not halted with the rearguard, was four or five hundred yards away. There was a brief uproar, a shouting of contradictory orders, and then the whole column turned and came back at a gallop. Mosby, four of his men, and the three prisoners, got away, but Beattie and two others were captured when their horses fell on a sheet of ice treacherously hidden under the snow. There was no possibility of rescuing them. After the capture of Beattie and his companions, the pursuit stopped. Halting at a distance, Mosby saw Wyndham form his force into a compact body and move off toward Aldie at a brisk trot. He sent off the prisoners under guard of two of his men and followed Wyndham’s retreat almost to Aldie without opportunity to inflict any more damage.</p>
			<p>During his stop at Middleburg, Wyndham had heaped coals on a growing opposition to Mosby, fostered by pro-Unionists in the neighborhood. Wyndham informed the townspeople that he would burn the town and imprison the citizens if Mosby continued the attacks on his outposts. A group of citizens, taking the threat to heart, petitioned Stuart to recall Mosby, but the general sent a stinging rebuke, telling the Middleburgers that Mosby and his men were risking their lives which were worth considerably more than a few houses and barns.</p>
			<p>Mosby was also worried about the antipathy to the Scott Law and the partisan ranger system which was growing among some of the general officers of the Confederacy. To counteract such opposition, he needed to achieve some spectacular feat of arms which would capture the popular imagination, make a public hero of himself, and place him above criticism.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>And all the while, his force was growing. The booty from his raids excited the cupidity of the more venturesome farmers, and they were exchanging the hoe for the revolver and joining him. A number of the convalescents and furloughed soldiers were arranging transfers to his command. Others, with no permanent military attachment, were drifting to Middleburg, Upperville, or Rectortown, inquiring where they might find Mosby, and making their way to join him.</p>
			<p>There was a young Irishman, Dick Moran. There was a Fauquier County blacksmith, Billy Hibbs, who reported armed with a huge broadsword which had been the last product of his forge. There were Walter Frankland, Joe Nelson, Frank Williams and George Whitescarver, among the first to join on a permanent basis. And, one day, there was the strangest recruit of all.</p>
			<p>A meeting was held on the 25th of February at the Blackwell farm, near Upperville, and Mosby and most of his men were in the kitchen of the farmhouse, going over a map of the section they intended raiding, when a couple of men who had been on guard outside entered, pushing a Union cavalry sergeant ahead of them.</p>
			<p>“This Yankee says he wants to see you, Captain,” one of the men announced. “He came on foot; says his horse broke a leg and had to be shot.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m Mosby,” the guerrilla leader said. “What do you want?”</p>
			<p>The man in blue came to attention and saluted.</p>
			<p>“I’ve come here to join your company, sir,” he said calmly.</p>
			<p>There was an excited outburst from the men in the kitchen, but Mosby took the announcement in stride.</p>
			<p>“And what’s your name and unit, sergeant?”</p>
			<p>“James <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">F.</abbr> Ames: late Fifth New York Cavalry, sir.”</p>
			<p>After further conversation, Mosby decided that the big Yankee was sincere in his avowed decision to join the forces of the Confederacy. He had some doubts about his alleged motives: the man was animated with a most vindictive hatred of the Union government, all his former officers and most of his former comrades. No one ever learned what injury, real or fancied, had driven Sergeant Ames to desertion and treason, but in a few minutes Mosby was sure that the man was through with the Union Army.</p>
			<p>Everybody else was equally sure that he was a spy, probably sent over by Wyndham to assassinate Mosby. Eventually Mosby proposed a test of Ames’ sincerity. The deserter should guide the company to a Union picket post, and should accompany the raiders unarmed: Mosby would ride behind him, ready to shoot him at the first sign of treachery. The others agreed to judge the new recruit by his conduct on the raid. A fairly strong post, at a schoolhouse at Thompson’s Corners, was selected as the objective, and they set out, sixteen men beside Ames and Mosby, through a storm of rain and sleet. Stopping at a nearby farm, Mosby learned that the post had been heavily reinforced since he had last raided it. There were now about a hundred men at the schoolhouse.</p>
			<p>Pleased at this evidence that his campaign to force the enemy to increase his guard was bearing fruit, Mosby decided to abandon his customary tactics of dismounting at a distance and approaching on foot. On a night like this, the enemy would not be expecting him, so the raiders advanced boldly along the road, Mosby telling Ames to make whatever answer he thought would be believed in case they were challenged. However, a couple of trigger-happy vedettes let off their carbines at them, yelled, “The Rebs are coming!” and galloped for the schoolhouse.</p>
			<p>There was nothing to do but gallop after them, and Mosby and his band came pelting in on the heels of the vedettes. Hitherto, his raids had been more or less bloodless, but this time he had a fight on his hands, and if the men in the schoolhouse had stayed inside and defended themselves with carbine fire, they would have driven off the attack. Instead, however, they rushed outside, each man trying to mount his horse. A lieutenant and seven men were killed, about twice that number wounded, and five prisoners were taken. The rest, believing themselves attacked by about twice their own strength, scattered into the woods and got away.</p>
			<p>Ames, who had ridden unarmed, flung himself upon a Union cavalryman at the first collision and disarmed him, then threw himself into the fight with the captured saber. His conduct during the brief battle at the schoolhouse was such as to remove from everybody’s mind the suspicion that his conversion to the Confederate cause was anything but genuine. Thereafter, he was accepted as a Mosby man.</p>
			<p>He was accepted by Mosby himself as a veritable godsend, since he was acquainted with the location of every Union force in Fairfax County, and knew of a corridor by which it would be possible to penetrate Wyndham’s entire system of cavalry posts as far as Fairfax Courthouse itself. Here, then, was the making of the spectacular coup which Mosby needed to answer his critics and enemies, both at Middleburg and at army headquarters. He decided to attempt nothing less than a raid upon Fairfax Courthouse, with the capture of Wyndham as its purpose.</p>
			<p>This last would entail something of a sacrifice, for he had come to esteem Sir Percy highly as an opponent whose mind was an open book and whose every move could be predicted in advance. With Wyndham eliminated, he would have to go to the trouble of learning the mental processes of his successor.</p>
			<p>However, Wyndham would be the ideal captive to grace a Mosby triumph, and a successful raid on Fairfax Courthouse, garrisoned as it was by between five and ten thousand Union troops, would not only secure Mosby’s position in his own army but would start just the sort of a panic which would result in demands that the Union rear be reinforced at the expense of the front.</p>
			<p>So, on Sunday, March 8, Mosby led thirty-nine men through the gap at Aldie, the largest force that had followed him to date. It was the sort of a foul night that he liked for raiding, with a drizzling rain falling upon melting snow. It was pitch dark before they found the road between Centreville and Fairfax, along which a telegraph line had been strung to connect the main cavalry camp with General Stoughton’s headquarters. Mosby sent one of his men, Harry Hatcher, up a pole to cut the wire. They cut another telegraph line at Fairfax Station and left the road, moving through the woods toward Fairfax Courthouse. At this time, only Mosby and Yank Ames knew the purpose of the expedition.</p>
			<p>It was therefore with surprise and some consternation that the others realized where they were as they rode into the courthouse square and halted. A buzz of excited whispers rose from the men.</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” Mosby assured them calmly. “We’re in Fairfax Courthouse, right in the middle of ten thousand Yankees, but don’t let that worry you. All but about a dozen of them are asleep. Now, if you all keep your heads and do what you’re told, we’ll be as safe as though we were in Jeff Davis’ front parlor.”</p>
			<p>He then began giving instructions, detailing parties to round up horses and capture any soldiers they found awake and moving about. He went, himself, with several men, to the home of a citizen named Murray, where he had been told that Wyndham had quartered himself, but here he received the disappointing news that the Englishman had gone to Washington that afternoon.</p>
			<p>A few minutes later, however, Joe Nelson came up with a prisoner, an infantryman who had just been relieved from sentry duty at General Stoughton’s headquarters, who said that there had been a party there earlier in the evening and that Stoughton and several other officers were still there. Mosby, still disappointed at his failure to secure Wyndham, decided to accept Stoughton in his place. Taking several men, he went at once to the house where the prisoner said Stoughton had his headquarters.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Arriving there, he hammered loudly on the door with a revolver butt. An upstairs window opened, and a head, in a nightcap, was thrust out.</p>
			<p>“What the devil’s all the noise about?” its owner demanded. “Don’t you know this is General Stoughton’s headquarters?”</p>
			<p>“I’d hoped it was; I almost killed a horse getting here,” Mosby retorted. “Come down and open up; dispatches from Washington.”</p>
			<p>In a few moments, a light appeared inside on the first floor, and the door opened. A man in a nightshirt, holding a candle, stood in the doorway.</p>
			<p>“I’m Lieutenant Prentiss, on General Stoughton’s staff. The general’s asleep. If you’ll give me the dispatches.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Mosby caught the man by the throat with his left hand and shoved a Colt into his face with his right. Dan Thomas, beside him, lifted the candle out of the other man’s hand.</p>
			<p>“And I’m Captain Mosby, General Stuart’s staff. We’ve just taken Fairfax Courthouse. Inside, now, and take me to the general at once.”</p>
			<p>The general was in bed, lying on his face in a tangle of bedclothes. Mosby pulled the sheets off of him, lifted the tail of his nightshirt and slapped him across the bare rump.</p>
			<p>The effect was electric. Stoughton sat up in bed, gobbling in fury. In the dim candlelight, he mistook the gray of Mosby’s tunic for blue, and began a string of bloodthirsty threats of court-martial and firing squad, interspersed with oaths.</p>
			<p>“Easy, now, General,” the perpetrator of the outrage soothed. “You’ve heard of John Mosby, haven’t you?”</p>
			<p>“Yes; have you captured him?” In the face of such tidings, Stoughton would gladly forget the assault on his person.</p>
			<p>Mosby shook his head, smiling seraphically. “No, General. He’s captured you. I’m Mosby.”</p>
			<p>“Oh my God!” Stoughton sank back on the pillow and closed his eyes, overcome.</p>
			<p>Knowing the precarious nature of his present advantage, Mosby then undertook to deprive Stoughton of any hope of rescue or will to resist.</p>
			<p>“Stuart’s cavalry is occupying Fairfax Courthouse,” he invented, “and Stonewall Jackson’s at Chantilly with his whole force. We’re all moving to occupy Alexandria by morning. You’ll have to hurry and dress, General.”</p>
			<p>“Is Fitzhugh Lee here?” Stoughton asked. “He’s a friend of mine; we were classmates at West Point.”</p>
			<p>“Why, no; he’s with Jackson at Chantilly. Do you want me to take you to him? I can do so easily if you hurry.”</p>
			<p>It does not appear that Stoughton doubted as much as one syllable of this remarkable set of prevarications. The Union Army had learned by bitter experience that Stonewall Jackson was capable of materializing almost anywhere. So he climbed out of bed, putting on his clothes.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>On the way back to the courthouse square, Prentiss got away from them in the darkness, but Mosby kept a tight hold on Stoughton’s bridle. By this time, the suspicion that all was not well in the county seat had begun to filter about. Men were beginning to turn out under arms all over town, and there was a confusion of challenges and replies and some occasional firing as hastily wakened soldiers mistook one another for the enemy. Mosby got his prisoners and horses together and started out of town as quickly as he could.</p>
			<p>The withdrawal was made over much the same route as the approach, without serious incident. Thanks to the precaution of cutting the telegraph wires, the camp at Centreville knew nothing of what had happened at Fairfax Courthouse until long after the raiders were safely away. They lost all but thirty of the prisoners⁠—in the woods outside Fairfax Courthouse, they escaped in droves⁠—but they brought Stoughton and the two captains out safely.</p>
			<p>The results were everything Mosby had hoped. He became a Confederate hero over night, and there was no longer any danger of his being recalled. There were several halfhearted attempts to kick him upstairs⁠—an offer of a commission in the now defunct Virginia Provisional Army, which he rejected scornfully, and a similar offer in the regular Confederate States Army, which he politely declined because it would deprive his men of their right to booty under the Scott Law. Finally he was given a majority in the Confederate States Army, with authorization to organize a partisan battalion under the Scott Law. This he accepted, becoming Major Mosby of the Forty-Third Virginia Partisan Ranger Battalion.</p>
			<p>The effect upon the enemy was no less satisfactory. When full particulars of the Fairfax raid reached Washington, Wyndham vanished from the picture, being assigned to other duties where less depended upon him. There was a whole epidemic of courts-martial and inquiries, some of which were still smouldering when the war ended. And Stoughton, the principal victim, found scant sympathy. President Lincoln, when told that the rebels had raided Fairfax to the tune of one general, two captains, thirty men and fifty-eight horses, remarked that he could make all the generals he wanted, but that he was sorry to lose the horses, as he couldn’t make horses. As yet, there was no visible reinforcement of the cavalry in Fairfax County from the front, but the line of picket posts was noticeably shortened.</p>
			<p>About two weeks later, with forty men, Mosby raided a post at Herndon Station, bringing off a major, a captain, two lieutenants and twenty-one men, with a horse apiece. A week later, with fifty-odd men, he cut up about three times his strength of Union cavalry at Chantilly. Having surprised a small party, he had driven them into a much larger force, and the hunted had turned to hunt the hunters. Fighting a delaying action with a few men while the bulk of his force fell back on an old roadblock of felled trees dating from the second Manassas campaign, he held off the enemy until he was sure his ambuscade was set, then, by feigning headlong flight, led them into a trap and chased the survivors for five or six miles. Wyndham and Stoughton had found Mosby an annoying nuisance; their successors were finding him a serious menace.</p>
			<p>This attitude was not confined to the local level, but extended all the way to the top echelons. The word passed down, “Get Mosby!” and it was understood that the officer responsible for his elimination would find his military career made for him. One of the Union officers who saw visions of rapid advancement over the wreckage of Mosby’s Rangers was a captain of the First Vermont, Josiah Flint by name. He was soon to have a chance at it.</p>
			<p>On March 31, Mosby’s Rangers met at Middleburg and moved across the mountain to Chantilly, expecting to take a strong outpost which had been located there. On arriving, they found the campsite deserted. The post had been pulled back closer to Fairfax after the fight of four days before. Mosby decided to move up to the Potomac and attack a Union force on the other side of Dranesville⁠—Captain Josiah Flint’s Vermonters.</p>
			<p>They passed the night at John Miskel’s farm, near Chantilly. The following morning, April 1, at about daybreak, Mosby was wakened by one of his men who had been sleeping in the barn. This man, having gone outside, had observed a small party of Union troops on the Maryland side of the river who were making semaphore signals to somebody on the Virginia side. Mosby ordered everybody to turn out as quickly as possible and went out to watch the signalmen with his field glasses. While he was watching, Dick Moran, a Mosby man who had billeted with friends down the road, arrived at a breakneck gallop from across the fields, shouting: “Mount your horses! The Yankees are coming!”</p>
			<p>It appeared that he had been wakened, shortly before, by the noise of a column of cavalry on the road in front of the house where he had been sleeping, and had seen a strong force of Union cavalry on the march in the direction of Broad Run and the Miskel farm. Waiting until they had passed, he had gotten his horse and circled at a gallop through the woods, reaching the farm just ahead of them. It later developed that a woman of the neighborhood, whose head had been turned by the attentions of Union officers, had betrayed Mosby to Flint.</p>
			<p>The Miskel farmhouse stood on the crest of a low hill, facing the river. Behind it stood the big barn, with a large barnyard enclosed by a high pole fence. As this was a horse farm, all the fences were eight feet high and quite strongly built. A lane ran down the slope of the hill between two such fences, and at the southern end of the slope another fence separated the meadows from a belt of woods, beyond which was the road from Dranesville, along which Flint’s column was advancing.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was a nasty spot for Mosby. He had between fifty and sixty men, newly roused from sleep, their horses unsaddled, and he was penned in by strong fences which would have to be breached if he were to escape. His only hope lay in a prompt counterattack. The men who had come out of the house and barn were frantically saddling horses, without much attention to whose saddle went on whose mount. Harry Hatcher, who had gotten his horse saddled, gave it to Mosby and appropriated somebody else’s mount.</p>
			<p>As Flint, at the head of his cavalry, emerged from the woods, Mosby had about twenty of his men mounted and was ready to receive him. The Union cavalry paused, somebody pulled out the gate bars at the foot of the lane, and the whole force started up toward the farm. Having opened the barnyard end of the lane, Mosby waited until Flint had come about halfway, then gave him a blast of revolver fire and followed this with a headlong charge down the lane. Flint was killed at the first salvo, as were several of the men behind him. By the time Mosby’s charge rammed into the head of the Union attack, the narrow lane was blocked with riderless horses, preventing each force from coming to grips with the other. Here Mosby’s insistence upon at least two revolvers for each man paid off, as did the target practice upon which he was always willing to expend precious ammunition. The Union column, constricted by the fences on either side of the lane and shaken by the death of their leader and by the savage attack of men whom they had believed hopelessly trapped, turned and tried to retreat, but when they reached the foot of the lane it was discovered that some fool, probably meaning to deny Mosby an avenue of escape, had replaced the gatebars. By this time, the rest of Mosby’s force had mounted their horses, breaches had been torn in the fence at either side of the lane, and there were Confederates in both meadows, firing into the trapped men. Until the gate at the lower end gave way under the weight of horses crowded against it, there was a bloody slaughter. Within a few minutes Flint and nine of his men were killed, some fifteen more were given disabling wounds, eighty-two prisoners were taken, and over a hundred horses and large quantities of arms and ammunition were captured. The remains of Flint’s force was chased as far as Dranesville. Mosby was still getting the prisoners sorted out, rounding up loose horses, gathering weapons and ammunition from casualties, and giving the wounded first aid, when a Union lieutenant rode up under a flag of truce, followed by several enlisted men and two civilians of the Sanitary Commission, the Civil War equivalent of the Red Cross, to pick up the wounded and bury the dead. This officer offered to care for Mosby’s wounded with his own, an offer which was declined with thanks. Mosby said he would carry his casualties with him, and the Union officer could scarcely believe his eyes when he saw only three wounded men on horse litters and one dead man tied to his saddle.</p>
			<p>The sutlers at Dranesville had heard the firing and were about to move away when Mosby’s column appeared. Seeing the preponderance of blue uniforms, they mistook the victors for prisoners and, anticipating a lively and profitable business, unpacked their loads and set up their counters. The business was lively, but anything but profitable. The Mosby men looted them unmercifully, taking their money, their horses, and everything else they had.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>All through the spring of 1863, Mosby kept jabbing at Union lines of communication in northern Virginia. In June, his majority came through, and with it authority to organize a battalion under the Scott Law. From that time on, he was on his own, and there was no longer any danger of his being recalled to the regular Army. He was responsible only to Jeb Stuart until the general’s death at Yellow Tavern a year later; thereafter, he took orders from no source below General Lee and the Secretary of War.</p>
			<p>Even before this regularization of status, Mosby’s force was beginning to look like a regular outfit. From the fifteen men he had brought up from Culpepper in mid-January, its effective and dependable strength had grown to about sixty riders, augmented from raid to raid by the “Conglomerate” fringe, who were now accepted as guerrillas-pro-tem without too much enthusiasm. A new type of recruit had begun to appear, the man who came to enlist on a permanent basis. Some were Maryland secessionists, like James Williamson, who, after the war, wrote an authoritative and well-documented history of the organization, Mosby’s Rangers. Some were boys like John Edmonds and John Munson, who had come of something approaching military age since the outbreak of the war. Some were men who had wangled transfers from other Confederate units. Not infrequently these men had given up commissions in the regular army to enlist as privates with Mosby. For example, there was the former clergyman, Sam Chapman, who had been a captain of artillery, or the Prussian uhlan lieutenant, Baron Robert von Massow, who gave up a captaincy on Stuart’s staff, or the Englishman, Captain Hoskins, who was shortly to lose his life because of his preference for the saber over the revolver, or Captain Bill Kennon, late of Wheat’s Louisiana Tigers, who had also served with Walker in Nicaragua. As a general thing, the new Mosby recruit was a man of high intelligence, reckless bravery and ultra-rugged individualism.</p>
			<p>For his home territory, Mosby now chose a rough quadrangle between the Blue Ridge and Bull Run Mountain, bounded at its four corners by Snicker’s Gap and Manassas Gap along the former and Thoroughfare Gap and Aldie Gap along the latter. Here, when not in action, the Mosby men billeted themselves, keeping widely dispersed, and an elaborate system, involving most of the inhabitants, free or slave, was set up to transmit messages, orders and warnings. In time this district came to be known as “Mosby’s Confederacy,” and, in the absence of any effective Confederate States civil authority, Mosby became the lawgiver and chief magistrate as well as military commander. John Munson, who also wrote a book of reminiscences after the war, said that Mosby’s Confederacy was an absolute monarchy, and that none was ever better governed in history.</p>
			<p>Adhering to his belief in the paramount importance of firepower, Mosby saw to it that none of his men carried fewer than two revolvers, and the great majority carried four, one pair on the belt and another on the saddle. Some extremists even carried a third pair down their boot-tops, giving them thirty-six shots without reloading. Nor did he underestimate the power of mobility. Each man had his string of horses, kept where they could be picked up at need. Unlike the regular cavalryman with his one mount, a Mosby man had only to drop an exhausted animal at one of these private remount stations and change his saddle to a fresh one. As a result of these two practices, Union combat reports throughout the war consistently credited Mosby with from three to five times his actual strength.</p>
			<p>In time, the entire economy of Mosby’s Confederacy came to be geared to Mosby’s operations, just as the inhabitants of seventeenth century Tortugas or Port Royal depended for their livelihood on the loot of the buccaneers. The Mosby man who lived with some farmer’s family paid for his lodging with gifts of foodstuffs and blankets looted from the enemy. There was always a brisk trade in captured <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.</abbr> Army horses and mules. And there was a steady flow of United States currency into the section, so that in time Confederate money was driven out of circulation in a sort of reversal of Gresham’s law. Every prisoner taken reasonably close to Army pay day could be counted on for a few dollars, and in each company there would be some lucky or skillful gambler who would have a fairly sizeable roll of greenbacks. And, of course, there was the sutler, the real prize catch; any Mosby man would pass up a general in order to capture a sutler.</p>
			<p>And Northern-manufactured goods filtered south by the wagonload. Many of the Mosby men wore Confederate uniforms that had been tailored for them in Baltimore and even in Washington and run through the Union lines.</p>
			<p>By mid-June, Lee’s invasion of Pennsylvania had begun and the countryside along Bull Run Mountain and the Blue Ridge exploded into a series of cavalry actions as the Confederate Army moved north along the Union right. Mosby kept his little force out of the main fighting, hacking away at the Union troops from behind and confusing their combat intelligence with reports of Rebel cavalry appearing where none ought to be. In the midst of this work, he took time out to dash across into Fairfax County with sixty men, shooting up a wagon train, burning wagons, and carrying off prisoners and mules, the latter being turned over to haul Lee’s invasion transport. After the two armies had passed over the Potomac, he gathered his force and launched an invasion of Pennsylvania on his own, getting as far as Mercersburg and bringing home a drove of over 200 beef cattle.</p>
			<p>He got back to Mosby’s Confederacy in time to learn of Lee’s defeat at Gettysburg. Realizing that Lee’s retreat would be followed by a pursuing Union army, he began making preparations to withstand the coming deluge. For one thing, he decided to do something he had not done before⁠—concentrate his force in a single camp on the top of Bull Run Mountain. In the days while Lee’s army was trudging southward, Mosby gathered every horse and mule and cow he could find and drove them into the mountains, putting boys and slaves to work herding them. He commandeered wagons, and hauled grain and hay to his temporary camp. His men erected huts, and built corrals for horses and a stockade for prisoners. They even moved a blacksmith shop to the hidden camp. Then Mosby sat down and waited.</p>
			<p>A few days later, Meade’s army began coming through. The Forty-Third Partisan Ranger Battalion went to work immediately. For two weeks, they galloped in and out among the Union columns, returning to their hidden camp only long enough to change horses and leave the prisoners they had taken. They cut into wagon trains, scattering cavalry escorts, burning wagons, destroying supplies, blowing up ammunition, disabling cannon, running off mules. They ambushed marching infantry, flitting away before their victims had recovered from the initial surprise. Sometimes, fleeing from the scene of one attack, they would burst through a column on another road, leaving confusion behind to delay the pursuit.</p>
			<p>Finally, the invaders passed on, the camp on the mountain top was abandoned, the Mosby men went back to their old billets, and the Forty-Third Battalion could take it easy again. That is to say, they only made a raid every couple of days and seldom fought a pitched battle more than once a week.</p>
			<p>The summer passed; the Virginia hills turned from green to red and from red to brown. Mosby was severely wounded in the side and thigh during a fight at Gooding’s Tavern on August 23, when two of his men were killed, but the raiders brought off eighty-five horses and twelve prisoners and left six enemy dead behind. The old days of bloodless sneak raids on isolated picket posts were past, now that they had enough men for two companies and Mosby rarely took the field with fewer than a hundred riders behind him.</p>
			<p>Back in the saddle again after recovering from his wounds, Mosby devoted more attention to attacking the Orange and Alexandria and the Manassas Gap railroads and to harassing attacks for the rest of the winter.</p>
			<p>In January, 1864, Major Cole, of the Union Maryland cavalry, began going out of his way to collide with the Forty-Third Virginia, the more so since he had secured the services of a deserter from Mosby, a man named Binns who had been expelled from the Rangers for some piece of rascality and was thirsting for revenge. Cole hoped to capitalize on Binns’ defection as Mosby had upon the desertion of Sergeant Ames, and he made several raids into Mosby’s Confederacy, taking a number of prisoners before the Mosby men learned the facts of the situation and everybody found a new lodging place.</p>
			<p>On the morning of February 20, Mosby was having breakfast at a farmhouse near Piedmont Depot, on the Manassas Gap Railroad, along with John Munson and John Edmonds, the teenage terrors, and a gunsmith named Jake Lavender, who was the battalion ordnance sergeant and engaged to young Edmonds’ sister. Edmonds had with him a couple of Sharps carbines he had repaired for other members of the battalion and was carrying to return to the owners. Suddenly John Edmonds’ younger brother, Jimmy, burst into the room with the news that several hundred Union cavalrymen were approaching. Lavender grabbed the two carbines, for which he had a quantity of ammunition, and they all ran outside.</p>
			<p>Sending the younger Edmonds boy to bring reinforcements, Mosby, accompanied by John Edmonds, Munson, and Jake Lavender, started to follow the enemy. He and Munson each took one of Lavender’s carbines and opened fire on them, Munson killing a horse and Mosby a man. That started things off properly. Cole’s Marylanders turned and gave chase, and Mosby led them toward the rendezvous with Jimmy Edmonds and the reinforcements. Everybody arrived together, Mosby’s party, the pursuers, and the reinforcements, and a running fight ensued, with Cole’s men running ahead. This mounted chase, in the best horse-opera manner, came thundering down a road past a schoolhouse just as the pupils were being let out for recess. One of these, a 14-year-old boy named Cabell Maddox, jumped onto the pony on which he had ridden to school and joined in the pursuit, armed only with a McGuffy’s Third Reader. Overtaking a fleeing Yank, he aimed the book at him and demanded his surrender; before the flustered soldier realized that his captor was unarmed, the boy had snatched the Colt from his belt and was covering him in earnest. This marked the suspension, for the duration of hostilities, of young Maddox’s formal education. From that hour on he was a Mosby man, and he served with distinction to the end of the war.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The chase broke off, finally, when the pursuers halted to get their prisoners and captured horses together. Then they discovered that one of their number, a man named Cobb, had been killed. Putting the dead man across his saddle, they carried the body back to Piedmont, and the next day assembled there for the funeral. The services had not yet started, and Mosby was finishing writing a report to Stuart on the previous day’s action, when a scout came pelting in to report Union cavalry in the vicinity of Middleburg.</p>
			<p>Leaving the funeral in the hands of the preacher and the civilian mourners, Mosby and the 150 men who had assembled mounted and started off. Sam Chapman, the ex-artillery captain, who had worked up from the ranks to a lieutenancy with Mosby, was left in charge of the main force, while Mosby and a small party galloped ahead to reconnoiter. The enemy, they discovered, were not Cole’s men but a California battalion. They learned that this force had turned in the direction of Leesburg, and that they were accompanied by the deserter, Binns.</p>
			<p>Mosby made up his mind to ambush the Californians on their way back to their camp at Vienna. He had plans, involving a length of rope, for his former trooper, Binns. The next morning, having crossed Bull Run Mountain the night before, he took up a position near Dranesville, with scouts out to the west. When the enemy were finally reported approaching, he was ready for them. Twenty of his 150, with carbines and rifles, were dismounted and placed in the center, under Lieutenant Mountjoy. The rest of the force was divided into two equal sections, under Chapman and Frank Williams, and kept mounted on the flanks. Mosby himself took his place with Williams on the right. While they waited, they could hear the faint boom of cannon from Washington, firing salutes in honor of Washington’s Birthday.</p>
			<p>A couple of men, posted in advance, acted as decoys, and the Union cavalry, returning empty-handed from their raid, started after them in hopes of bringing home at least something to show for their efforts. Before they knew it, they were within range of Mountjoy’s concealed riflemen. While they were still in disorder from the surprise volley, the two mounted sections swept in on them in a blaze of revolver fire, and they broke and fled. There was a nasty jam in a section of fenced road, with mounted Mosby men in the woods on either side and Mountjoy’s rifles behind them. Before they could get clear of this, they lost fifteen killed, fifteen more wounded, and over seventy prisoners, and the victorious Mosby men brought home over a hundred captured horses and large quantities of arms and ammunition. To their deep regret, however, Binns was not to be found either among the casualties or the prisoners. As soon as he had seen how the fight was going, the deserter had spurred off northward, never to appear in Virginia again. Mosby’s own loss had been one man killed and four wounded.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>For the rest of the spring, operations were routine⁠—attacks on wagon trains and train wrecking and bridge burning on the railroads. With the cut-and-try shifting of command of the Union Army of the Potomac over and Grant in command, there was activity all over northern Virginia. About this time, Mosby got hold of a second twelve-pound howitzer, and, later, a twelve-pound Napoleon and added the Shenandoah Valley to his field of operations.</p>
			<p>From then on, Mosby was fighting a war on two fronts, dividing his attention between the valley and the country to the east of Bull Run Mountain, his men using their spare horses freely to keep the Union rear on both sides in an uproar. The enemy, knowing the section from whence Mosby was operating, resorted to frequent counter-raiding. Often, returning from a raid, the Mosby men would find their home territory invaded and would have to intercept or fight off the invaders. At this time, Mosby was giving top priority to attacks on Union transport whether on the roads or the railroads. Wagon trains were in constant movement, both moving up the Shenandoah Valley and bound for the Army of the Potomac, in front of Petersburg. To the east was the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, to the south, across the end of Mosby’s Confederacy, was the Manassas Gap, and at the upper end of the valley was the B. &amp; O. The section of the Manassas Gap Railroad along the southern boundary of Mosby’s Confederacy came in for special attention, and the Union Army finally gave it up for a bad job and abandoned it. This writer’s grandfather, Captain <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H. B.</abbr> Piper, of the Eleventh Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, did a stint of duty guarding it, and until he died he spoke with respect of the abilities of John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Mosby and his raiders. Locomotives were knocked out with one or another of Mosby’s twelve-pounders. Track was torn up and bridges were burned. Land-mines were planted. Trains were derailed and looted, usually with sharp fighting.</p>
			<p>By mid-July, Mosby had been promoted to lieutenant colonel and had a total strength of around 300 men, divided into five companies. His younger brother, William Mosby, had joined him and was acting as his adjutant. He now had four guns, all twelve-pounders⁠—two howitzers, the Napoleon and a new rifle, presented to him by Jubal Early. He had a compact, well-disciplined and powerful army-in-miniature. After the Union defeat at Kernstown, Early moved back to the lower end of the Shenandoah Valley, and McCausland went off on his raid in to Pennsylvania, burning Chambersburg in retaliation for Hunter’s burnings at Lexington and Buchanan in Virginia. Following his customary practice, Mosby made a crossing at another point and raided into Maryland as far as Adamstown, skirmishing and picking up a few prisoners and horses.</p>
			<p>Early’s invasion of Maryland, followed as it was by McCausland’s sack of Chambersburg, was simply too much for the Union command. The Shenandoah situation had to be cleaned up immediately, and, after some top-echelon dickering, Grant picked Phil Sheridan to do the cleaning. On August 7, Sheridan assumed command of the heterogeneous Union forces in the Shenandoah and began welding them into an army. On the 10th, he started south after Early, and Mosby, who generally had a good idea of what was going on at Union headquarters, took a small party into the valley, intending to kidnap the new commander as he had Stoughton. Due mainly to the vigilance of a camp sentry, the plan failed, but Mosby picked up the news that a large wagon train was being sent up the valley, and he decided to have a try at this.</p>
			<p>On the evening of the 12th, he was back in the valley with 330 men and his two howitzers. Spending the night at a plantation on the right bank of the Shenandoah River, he was on the move before daybreak, crossing the river and pushing toward Berryville, with scouts probing ahead in the heavy fog. One of the howitzers broke a wheel and was pushed into the brush and left behind. As both pieces were of the same caliber, the caisson was taken along. A lieutenant and fifteen men, scouting ahead, discovered a small empty wagon train, going down the valley in the direction of Harper’s Ferry, and they were about to attack it when they heard, in the distance, the rumbling of many heavily loaded wagons. This was the real thing. They forgot about the empty wagons and hastened back to Mosby and the main force to report.</p>
			<p>Swinging to the left to avoid premature contact with the train, Mosby hurried his column in the direction of Berryville. On the way, he found a disabled wagon, part of the northbound empty train, with the teamster and several infantrymen sleeping in it. These were promptly secured, and questioning elicited the information that the southbound train consisted of 150 wagons, escorted by 250 cavalry and a brigade of infantry. Getting into position on a low hill overlooking the road a little to the east of Berryville, the howitzer was unlimbered and the force was divided on either side of it, Captain Adolphus Richards taking the left wing and Sam Chapman the right. Mosby himself remained with the gun. Action was to be commenced with the gun, and the third shot was to be the signal for both Richards and Chapman to charge.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>At just the right moment, the fog lifted. The gun was quickly laid on the wagon train and fired, the first shot beheading a mule. The second shell hit the best sort of target imaginable⁠—a mobile farrier’s forge. There was a deadly shower of horseshoes, hand-tools and assorted ironmongery, inflicting casualties and causing a local panic. The third shell landed among some cavalry who were galloping up, scattering them, and, on the signal, Richards and Chapman charged simultaneously.</p>
			<p>Some infantry at the head of the train met Richards with a volley, costing him one man killed and several wounded and driving his charge off at an angle into the middle of the train. The howitzer, in turn, broke up the infantry. Chapman, who had hit the rear of the train, was having easier going: his men methodically dragged the teamsters from their wagons, unhitched mules, overturned, looted and burned wagons. The bulk of the escort, including the infantry, were at the front of the train, with Richards’ men between them and Chapman. Richards, while he had his hands full with these, was not neglecting the wagons, either, though he was making less of a ceremony of it. A teamster was shot and dragged from his wagon-seat, a lighted bundle of inflammables tossed into the wagon, and pistols were fired around the mules’ heads to start them running. The faster they ran, the more the flames behind them were fanned, and as the wagon went careening down the road, other wagons were ignited by it.</p>
			<p>By 8 <abbr>a.m.</abbr>, the whole thing was over. The escort had been scattered, the wagons were destroyed, and the victors moved off, in possession of 500-odd mules, thirty-six horses, about 200 head of beef cattle, 208 prisoners, four Negro slaves who had been forcibly emancipated to drive Army wagons, and large quantities of supplies. In one of the wagons, a number of violins, probably equipment for some prototype of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.O.</abbr>, were found; the more musically inclined guerrillas appropriated these and enlivened the homeward march with music.</p>

			<p>Of course, there was jubilation all over Mosby’s Confederacy on their return. The mules were herded into the mountains, held for about a week, and then started off for Early’s army. The beef herd was divided among the people, and there were barbecues and feasts. A shadow was cast over the spirits of the raiders, however, when the prisoners informed them, with considerable glee, that the train had been carrying upwards of a million dollars, the pay for Sheridan’s army. Even allowing for exaggeration, the fact that they had overlooked this treasure was a bitter pill for the Mosbyites. According to local tradition, however, the fortune was not lost completely; there were stories of a Berryville family who had been quite poor before the war but who blossomed into unexplained affluence afterward.</p>
			<p>Less than a week later, on August 19, Mosby was in the valley again with 250 men, dividing his force into several parties after crossing the river at Castleman’s Ford. Richards, with “B” Company, set off toward Charlestown. Mosby himself took “A” toward Harper’s Ferry on an uneventful trip during which the only enemies he encountered were a couple of stragglers caught pillaging a springhouse. It was Chapman, with “C” and “D,” who saw the action on this occasion.</p>
			<p>Going to the vicinity of Berryville, he came to a burning farmhouse, and learned that it had been fired only a few minutes before by some of Custer’s cavalry. Leaving a couple of men to help the family control the fire and salvage their possessions, he pressed on rapidly. Here was the thing every Mosby man had been hoping for⁠—a chance to catch house burners at work. They passed a second blazing house and barn, dropping off a couple more men to help fight fire, and caught up with the incendiaries, a company of Custer’s men, just as they were setting fire to a third house. Some of these, knowing the quality of mercy they might expect from Mosby men, made off immediately at a gallop. About ninety of them, however, tried to form ranks and put up a fight. The fight speedily became a massacre. Charging with shouts of “No quarters!,” Chapman’s men drove them into a maze of stone fences and killed about a third of them before the rest were able to extricate themselves.</p>
			<p>This didn’t stop the house burnings, by any means. The devastation of the Shenandoah Valley had been decided upon as a matter of strategy, and Sheridan was going through with it. The men who were ordered to do the actual work did not have their morale improved any by the knowledge that Mosby’s Rangers were refusing quarter to incendiary details, however, and, coming as it did on the heels of the wagon train affair of the 13th, Sheridan was convinced that something drastic would have to be done about Mosby. Accordingly, he set up a special company, under a Captain William Blazer, each man armed with a pair of revolvers and a Spencer repeater, to devote their entire efforts to eliminating Mosby and his organized raiders.</p>
			<p>On September 3, this company caught up with Joe Nelson and about 100 men in the valley and gave them a sound drubbing, the first that the Mosby men had experienced for some time. It was a humiliating defeat for them, and, on the other side, it was hailed as the beginning of the end of the Mosby nuisance. A few days later, while raiding to the east of Bull Run Mountain, Mosby was wounded again, and was taken to Lynchburg. He was joined by his wife, who remained with him at Lynchburg and at Mosby’s Confederacy until the end of the war.</p>
			<p>During his absence, the outfit seems to have been run by a sort of presidium of the senior officers. On September 22, Sam Chapman took 120 men into the valley to try to capture a cavalry post supposed to be located near Front Royal, but, arriving there, he learned that his information had been incorrect and that no such post existed. Camping in the woods, he sent some men out as scouts, and the next morning they reported a small wagon train escorted by about 150 cavalry, moving toward Front Royal. Dividing his force and putting half of it under Walter Frankland, he planned to attack the train from the rear while Frankland hit it from in front. After getting into position, he kept his men concealed, waiting for the wagons to pass, and as it did, he realized that his scouts had seen only a small part of it. The escort looked to him like about three regiments. Ordering his men to slip away as quietly as possible, he hurried to reach Frankland.</p>
			<p>“Turn around, Walter!” he yelled. “Get your men out of here! You’re attacking a whole brigade!”</p>
			<p>“What of it?” Frankland replied. “Why, Sam, we have the bastards on the run already!”</p>
			<p>Chapman, the erstwhile clergyman, turned loose a blast of theological language in purely secular connotation. Frankland, amazed at this blasphemous clamor from his usually pious comrade, realized that it must have been inspired by something more than a little serious, and began ordering his men to fall back. Before they had all gotten away, two of the three Union regiments accompanying the wagons came galloping up and swamped them. Most of the men got away but six of them, Anderson, Carter, Overby, Love, Rhodes and Jones, were captured.</p>
			<p>Late that night some of the stragglers, making their way back to Mosby’s Confederacy on foot, reported the fate of these six men. They had been taken into Front Royal, and there, at the personal order of General George A. Custer, and under circumstances of extreme brutality, they had all been hanged. Rhodes’ mother, who lived in Front Royal, had been forced to witness the hanging of her son.</p>
			<p>To put it conservatively, there was considerable excitement in Mosby’s Confederacy when the news of this atrocity was received. The senior officers managed to restore a measure of calmness, however, and it was decided to wait until Mosby returned before taking any action on the matter.</p>
			<p>In addition to the hangings at Front Royal, Custer was acquiring a bad reputation because of his general brutality to the people of the Shenandoah Valley. After the battle of the Little Bighorn, Sitting Bull would have probably won any popularity contest in northern Virginia without serious competition.</p>
			<p>On September 29, Mosby was back with his command; his wound had not been as serious as it might have been for the bullet had expended most of its force against the butt of one of the revolvers in his belt. Operations against the railroads had been allowed to slacken during Mosby’s absence; now they were stepped up again. Track was repeatedly torn up along the Manassas Gap line, and there were attacks on camps and strong points, and continual harassing of wood-cutting parties obtaining fuel for the locomotives. The artillery was taken out, and trains were shelled. All this, of course, occasioned a fresh wave of Union raids into the home territory of the raiders, during one of which Yank Ames, who had risen to a lieutenancy in the Forty-Third, was killed.</p>
			<p>The most desperate efforts were being made, at this time, to keep the Manassas Gap Railroad open, and General <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C. C.</abbr> Augur, who had charge of the railroad line at the time, was arresting citizens indiscriminately and forcing them to ride on the trains as hostages. Mosby obtained authorization from Lee’s headquarters to use reprisal measures on officers and train crews of trains on which citizens were being forced to ride, and also authority to execute prisoners from Custer’s command in equal number to the men hanged at Front Royal and elsewhere.</p>
			<p>It was not until November that he was able to secure prisoners from Custer’s brigade, it being his intention to limit his retaliation to men from units actually involved in the hangings. On November 6, he paraded about twenty-five such prisoners and forced them to draw lots, selecting, in this manner, seven of them⁠—one for each of the men hanged at Front Royal and another for a man named Willis who had been hanged at Gaines’ Cross Roads several weeks later. It was decided that they should be taken into the Shenandoah Valley and hanged beside the Valley Pike, where their bodies could serve as an object lesson. On the way, one of them escaped. Four were hanged, and then, running out of rope, they prepared to shoot the other two. One of these got away during a delay caused by defective percussion caps on his executioner’s revolver.</p>
			<p>A sign was placed over the bodies, setting forth the reason for their execution, and Mosby also sent one of his men under a flag of truce to Sheridan’s headquarters, with a statement of what had been done and why, reinforced with the intimation that he had more prisoners, including a number of officers, in case his messenger failed to return safely. Sheridan replied by disclaiming knowledge of the Front Royal hangings, agreeing that Mosby was justified in taking reprisals, and assuring the Confederate leader that hereafter his men would be given proper treatment as prisoners of war. There was no repetition of the hangings.</p>
			<p>By this time the Shenandoah Valley campaign as such was over. The last Confederate effort to clear Sheridan out of the Valley had failed at Cedar Creek on October 19, and the victor was going methodically about his task of destroying the strategic and economic usefulness of the valley. How well he succeeded in this was best expressed in Sheridan’s own claim that a crow flying over the region would have to carry his own rations. The best Mosby could do was to launch small raiding parties to harass the work of destruction.</p>
			<p>By the beginning of December, the northern or Loudoun County end of Mosby’s Confederacy was feeling the enemy scourge as keenly as the valley, and the winter nights were lighted with the flames of burning houses and barns. For about a week, while this was going on, Mosby abandoned any attempt at organized action. His men, singly and in small parties, darted in and out among the invaders, sniping and bushwhacking, attacking when they could and fleeing when they had to, and taking no prisoners. When it was over, the northern end of Mosby’s Confederacy was in ashes and most of the people had “refugeed out,” but Mosby’s Rangers, as a fighting force, was still intact. On December 17, for instance, while Mosby was in Richmond conferring with General Lee, they went into the valley again in force, waylaying a column of cavalry on the march, killing and wounding about thirty and bringing off 168 prisoners and horses.</p>
			<p>When Mosby came back from Lee’s headquarters, a full colonel now, his brother William was made a lieutenant-colonel, and Richards became a major. The southern, or Fauquier County, end of Mosby’s Confederacy was still more or less intact, though crowded with refugees. There was even time, in spite of everything, for the wedding of the Forty-Third’s armorer, Jake Lavender, with John and Jimmy Edmonds’ sister.</p>
			<p>While the wedding party was in progress, a report was brought in to the effect that Union cavalry were in the neighborhood of Salem, a few miles away. Mosby took one of his men, Tom Love, a relative of one of the Front Royal victims, and went to investigate, finding that the enemy had moved in the direction of Rectortown, where they were making camp for the night. Sending a resident of the neighborhood to alert Chapman and Richards for an attack at daybreak, Mosby and Love set out to collect others of his command.</p>
			<p>By this time, it was dark, with a freezing rain covering everything with ice. Mosby and Love decided to stop at the farm of Ludwell Lake for something to eat before going on; Love wanted to stay outside on guard, but Mosby told him to get off his horse and come inside. As they would have been in any house in the neighborhood, Mosby and his companion were welcomed as honored guests and sat down with the family to a hearty meal of spareribs.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>While they were eating, the house was surrounded by Union cavalry. Mosby rushed to the back door, to find the backyard full of soldiers. He started for the front door, but as he did, it burst open and a number of Yankees, officers and men, entered the house. At the same time, the soldiers behind, having seen the back door open and shut, began firing at the rear windows, and one bullet hit Mosby in the abdomen. In the confusion, with the women of the Lake family screaming, the soldiers cursing, and bullets coming through the windows, the kitchen table was overturned and the lights extinguished. Mosby in the dark, managed to crawl into a first-floor bedroom, where he got off his telltale belt and coat, stuffing them under the bed. Then he lay down on the floor.</p>
			<p>After a while, the shooting outside stopped, the officers returned, and the candles were relighted. The Union officers found Mosby on the floor, bleeding badly, and asked the family who he was. They said, of course, that they did not know, and neither did Tom Love⁠—he was only a Confederate officer on his way to rejoin his command, who had stopped for a night’s lodging. There was a surgeon with the Union detachment. After they got most of Mosby’s clothes off and put him on the bed, he examined the wounded Confederate and pronounced his wound mortal. When asked his name and unit, Mosby, still conscious, hastily improvised a false identity, at the same time congratulating himself on having left all his documents behind when starting on this scouting trip. Having been assured, by medical authority, that he was as good as dead, the Union officers were no longer interested in him and soon went away.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Fortunately, on his visit to Lee’s headquarters, Mosby had met an old schoolmate, a <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Montiero, who was now a surgeon with the Confederate Army, and, persuading him to get a transfer, had brought him back with him. Montiero’s new <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">C.O.</abbr> was his first patient in his new outfit. Early the next morning, he extracted the bullet. The next night Mosby was taken to Lynchburg.</p>
			<p>Despite the Union doctor’s pronouncement of his impending death, Mosby was back in action again near the end of February, 1865. His return was celebrated with another series of raids on both sides of the mountains. It was, of course, obvious to everybody that the sands of the Confederacy were running out, but the true extent of the debacle was somewhat obscured to Mosby’s followers by their own immediate successes. Peace rumors began drifting about, the favorite item of wish-thinking being that the Union government was going to recognize the Confederacy and negotiate a peace in return for Confederate help in throwing the French out of Mexico. Of course, Mosby himself never believed any such nonsense, but he continued his attacks as though victory were just around the corner. On April 5, two days after the Union army entered Richmond, a party of fifty Mosby men caught their old enemies, the Loudoun Rangers, in camp near Halltown and beat them badly. On April 9, the day of Lee’s surrender, “D” Company and the newly organized “H” Company fired the last shots for the Forty-Third Virginia in a skirmish in Fairfax County. Two days later, Mosby received a message from General Hancock, calling for his surrender.</p>
			<p>He sent a group of his officers⁠—William Mosby, Sam Chapman, Walter Frankland and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Montiero⁠—with a flag of truce, and, after several other meetings with Hancock, the command was disbanded and most of the men went in to take the parole.</p>
			<p>When his armistice with Hancock expired, Mosby found himself with only about forty irreconcilables left out of his whole command. As General Joe Johnston had not yet surrendered, he did not feel justified in getting out of the fight, himself. With his bloodied but unbowed handful, he set out on the most ambitious project of his entire military career⁠—nothing less than a plan to penetrate into Richmond and abduct General Grant. If this scheme succeeded, it was his intention to dodge around the Union Army, carry his distinguished prisoner to Johnston, and present him with a real bargaining point for negotiating terms.</p>
			<p>They reached the outskirts of Richmond and made a concealed camp across the river, waiting for darkness. In the meanwhile, two of the party, both natives of the city, Munson and Cole Jordan, went in to scout. Several hours passed, and neither returned. Mosby feared that they had been picked up by Union patrols. He was about to send an older man, Lieutenant Ben Palmer, when a canal-boat passed, and, hailing it, they learned of Johnston’s surrender.</p>
			<p>That was the end of the scheme to kidnap Grant. As long as a Confederate force was still under arms, it would have been a legitimate act of war. Now, it would be mere brigandage, and Mosby had no intention of turning brigand.</p>
			<p>So Mosby returned to Fauquier County to take the parole. For him, the fighting was over, but he was soon to discover that the war was not. At that time, Edwin <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">M.</abbr> Stanton was making frantic efforts to inculpate as many prominent Confederates as possible in the Booth conspiracy, and Mosby’s name was suggested as a worthy addition to Stanton’s long and fantastic list of alleged conspirators. A witness was produced to testify that Mosby had been in Washington on the night of the assassination, April 14. At that time, Stanton was able to produce a witness to almost anything he wanted to establish. Fortunately, Mosby had an alibi; at the time in question, he had been at Hancock’s headquarters, discussing armistice terms; even Stanton couldn’t get around that.</p>
			<p>However, he was subjected to considerable petty persecution, and once he was flung into jail without charge and held incommunicado. His wife went to Washington to plead his case before President Johnson, who treated her with a great deal less than courtesy, and then before General Grant, who promptly gave her a written order for her husband’s release.</p>
			<p>Then, in 1868, he did something which would have been social and political suicide for any Southerner with a less imposing war record. He supported Ulysses <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Grant for President. It was about as unexpected as any act in an extremely unconventional career, and, as usual, he had a well-reasoned purpose. Grant, he argued, was a professional soldier, not a politician. His enmity toward the South had been confined to the battlefield and had ended with the war. He had proven his magnanimity to the defeated enemy, and as President, he could be trusted to show fairness and clemency to the South.</p>
			<p>While Virginia had not voted in the election of 1868, there is no question that Mosby’s declaration of support helped Grant, and Grant was grateful, inviting Mosby to the White House after his inauguration and later appointing him to the United States consulate at Hong Kong. After the expiration of his consular service, Mosby resumed his law practice, eventually taking up residence in Washington. He found time to write several books⁠—war reminiscences and memoirs, and a volume in vindication of his former commander, Jeb Stuart, on the Confederate cavalry in the Gettysburg campaign. He died in Washington, at the age of eighty-three, in 1916.</p>
			<p>The really important part of John Mosby’s career, of course, was the two years and three months, from January, 1863, to April, 1865, in which he held independent command. With his tiny force⁠—it never exceeded 500 men⁠—he had compelled the Union army to employ at least one and often as high as three brigades to guard against his depredations, and these men, held in the rear, were as much out of the war proper as though they had been penned up in Andersonville or Libby Prison.</p>
			<p>In addition to this, every northward movement of the Confederate Army after January, 1863, was accompanied by a diversionary operation of Mosby’s command, sometimes tactically insignificant but always contributing, during the critical time of the operation, to the uncertainty of Union intelligence. Likewise, every movement to the south of the Army of the Potomac was harassed from behind.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It may also be noted that Sheridan, quite capable of dealing with the menace of Stuart, proved helpless against the Mosby nuisance, although, until they were wiped out, Blazer’s Scouts were the most efficient anti-Mosby outfit ever employed. In spite of everything that was done against them, however, Mosby’s Rangers stayed in business longer than Lee’s army, and when they finally surrendered, it was not because they, themselves, had been defeated, but because the war had been literally jerked out from under them.</p>
			<p>Mosby made the cavalry a formidable amalgamation of fire power and mobility and his influence on military history was felt directly, and survived him by many years. In his last days, while living in Washington, the old Confederate guerrilla had a youthful friend, a young cavalry lieutenant fresh from West Point, to whom he enjoyed telling the stories of his raids and battles and to whom he preached his gospel of fire and mobility. This young disciple of Mosby’s old age was to make that gospel his own, and to practice it, later, with great success. The name of this young officer was George <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Patton, <abbr class="eoc">Jr.</abbr></p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Temple Trouble</h2>
			<p>Through a haze of incense and altar smoke, Yat-Zar looked down from his golden throne at the end of the dusky, many-pillared temple. Yat-Zar was an idol, of gigantic size and extraordinarily good workmanship; he had three eyes, made of turquoises as big as doorknobs, and six arms. In his three right hands, from top to bottom, he held a sword with a flame-shaped blade, a jeweled object of vaguely phallic appearance, and, by the ears, a rabbit. In his left hands were a bronze torch with burnished copper flames, a big goblet, and a pair of scales with an egg in one pan balanced against a skull in the other. He had a long bifurcate beard made of gold wire, feet like a bird’s, and other rather startling anatomical features. His throne was set upon a stone plinth about twenty feet high, into the front of which a doorway opened; behind him was a wooden screen, elaborately gilded and painted.</p>
			<p>Directly in front of the idol, Ghullam the high priest knelt on a big blue and gold cushion. He wore a gold-fringed robe of dark blue, and a tall conical gold miter, and a bright blue false beard, forked like the idol’s golden one: he was intoning a prayer, and holding up, in both hands, for divine inspection and approval, a long curved knife. Behind him, about thirty feel away, stood a square stone altar, around which four of the lesser priests, in light blue robes with less gold fringe and dark-blue false beards, were busy with the preliminaries to the sacrifice. At considerable distance, about halfway down the length of the temple, some two hundred worshipers⁠—a few substantial citizens in gold-fringed tunics, artisans in tunics without gold fringe, soldiers in mail hauberks and plain steel caps, one officer in ornately gilded armor, a number of peasants in nondescript smocks, and women of all classes⁠—were beginning to prostrate themselves on the stone floor.</p>
			<p>Ghullam rose to his feet, bowing deeply to Yat-Zar and holding the knife extended in front of him, and backed away toward the altar. As he did, one of the lesser priests reached into a fringed and embroidered sack and pulled out a live rabbit, a big one, obviously of domestic breed, holding it by the ears while one of his fellows took it by the hind legs. A third priest caught up a silver pitcher, while the fourth fanned the altar fire with a sheet-silver fan. As they began chanting antiphonally, Ghullam turned and quickly whipped the edge of his knife across the rabbit’s throat. The priest with the pitcher stepped in to catch the blood, and when the rabbit was bled, it was laid on the fire. Ghullam and his four assistants all shouted together, and the congregation shouted in response.</p>
			<p>The high priest waited as long as was decently necessary and then, holding the knife in front of him, stepped around the prayer-cushion and went through the door under the idol into the Holy of Holies. A boy in novice’s white robes met him and took the knife, carrying it reverently to a fountain for washing. Eight or ten under-priests, sitting at a long table, rose and bowed, then sat down again and resumed their eating and drinking. At another table, a half-dozen upper priests nodded to him in casual greeting.</p>
			<p>Crossing the room, Ghullam went to the Triple Veil in front of the House of Yat-Zar, where only the highest of the priesthood might go, and parted the curtains, passing through, until he came to the great gilded door. Here he fumbled under his robe and produced a small object like a mechanical pencil, inserting the pointed end in a tiny hole in the door and pressing on the other end. The door opened, then swung shut behind him, and as it locked itself, the lights came on within. Ghullam removed his miter and his false beard, tossing them aside on a table, then undid his sash and peeled out of his robe. His regalia discarded, he stood for a moment in loose trousers and a soft white shirt, with a pistollike weapon in a shoulder holster under his left arm⁠—no longer Ghullam the high priest of Yat-Zar, but now Stranor Sleth, resident agent on this timeline of the Fourth Level Proto-Aryan Sector for the Transtemporal Mining Corporation. Then he opened a door at the other side of the anteroom and went to the antigrav shaft, stepping over the edge and floating downward.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>There were temples of Yat-Zar on every timeline of the Proto-Aryan Sector, for the worship of Yat-Zar was ancient among the Hulgun people of that area of paratime, but there were only a few which had such installations as this, and all of them were owned and operated by Transtemporal Mining, which had the fissionable ores franchise for this sector. During the ten elapsed centuries since Transtemporal had begun operations on this sector, the process had become standardized. A few First Level paratimers would transpose to a selected timeline and abduct an upper-priest of Yat-Zar, preferably the high priest of the temple at Yoldav or Zurb. He would be drugged and transposed to the First Level, where he would receive hypnotic indoctrination and, while unconscious, have an operation performed on his ears which would enable him to hear sounds well above the normal audible range. He would be able to hear the shrill sonar-cries of bats, for instance, and, more important, he would be able to hear voices when the speaker used a First Level audio-frequency step-up phone. He would also receive a memory-obliteration from the moment of his abduction, and a set of pseudo-memories of a visit to the Heaven of Yat-Zar, on the other side of the sky. Then he would be returned to his own timeline and left on a mountain top far from his temple, where an unknown peasant, leading a donkey, would always find him, return him to the temple, and then vanish inexplicably.</p>
			<p>Then the priest would begin hearing voices, usually while serving at the altar. They would warn of future events, which would always come to pass exactly as foretold. Or they might bring tidings of things happening at a distance, the news of which would not arrive by normal means for days or even weeks. Before long, the holy man who had been carried alive to the Heaven of Yat-Zar would acquire a most awesome reputation as a prophet, and would speedily rise to the very top of the priestly hierarchy.</p>
			<p>Then he would receive two commandments from Yat-Zar. The first would ordain that all lower priests must travel about from temple to temple, never staying longer than a year at any one place. This would insure a steady influx of newcomers personally unknown to the local upper-priests, and many of them would be First Level paratimers. Then, there would be a second commandment: A house must be built for Yat-Zar, against the rear wall of each temple. Its dimensions were minutely stipulated; its walls were to be of stone, without windows, and there was to be a single door, opening into the Holy of Holies, and before the walls were finished, the door was to be barred from within. A triple veil of brocaded fabric was to be hung in front of this door. Sometimes such innovations met with opposition from the more conservative members of the hierarchy: when they did, the principal objector would be seized with a sudden and violent illness; he would recover if and when he withdrew his objections.</p>
			<p>Very shortly after the House of Yat-Zar would be completed, strange noises would be heard from behind the thick walls. Then, after a while, one of the younger priests would announce that he had been commanded in a vision to go behind the veil and knock upon the door. Going behind the curtains, he would use his door-activator to let himself in, and return by paratime-conveyer to the First Level to enjoy a well-earned vacation. When the high priest would follow him behind the veil, after a few hours, and find that he had vanished, it would be announced as a miracle. A week later, an even greater miracle would be announced. The young priest would return from behind the Triple Veil, clad in such raiment as no man had ever seen, and bearing in his hands a strange box. He would announce that Yat-Zar had commanded him to build a new temple in the mountains, at a place to be made known by the voice of the god speaking out of the box.</p>
			<p>This time, there would be no doubts and no objections. A procession would set out, headed by the new revelator bearing the box, and when the clicking voice of the god spoke rapidly out of it, the site would be marked and work would begin. No local labor would ever be employed on such temples; the masons and woodworkers would be strangers, come from afar and speaking a strange tongue, and when the temple was completed, they would never be seen to leave it. Men would say that they had been put to death by the priest and buried under the altar to preserve the secrets of the god. And there would always be an idol to preserve the secrets of the god. And there would always be an idol of Yat-Zar, obviously of heavenly origin, since its workmanship was beyond the powers of any local craftsman. The priests of such a temple would be exempt, by divine decree, from the rule of yearly travel.</p>
			<p>Nobody, of course, would have the least idea that there was a uranium mine in operation under it, shipping ore to another timeline. The Hulgun people knew nothing about uranium, and neither did they as much as dream that there were other timelines. The secret of paratime transposition belonged exclusively to the First Level civilization which had discovered it, and it was a secret that was guarded well.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Stranor Sleth, dropping to the bottom of the antigrav shaft, cast a hasty and instinctive glance to the right, where the freight conveyers were. One was gone, taking its cargo over hundreds of thousands of parayears to the First Level. Another had just returned, empty, and a third was receiving its cargo from the robot mining machines far back under the mountain. Two young men and a girl, in First Level costumes, sat at a bank of instruments and visor-screens, handling the whole operation, and six or seven armed guards, having inspected the newly-arrived conveyer and finding that it had picked up nothing inimical en route, were relaxing and lighting cigarettes. Three of them, Stranor Sleth noticed, wore the green uniforms of the Paratime Police.</p>
			<p>“When did those fellows get in?” he asked the people at the control desk, nodding toward the green-clad newcomers.</p>
			<p>“About ten minutes ago, on the passenger conveyer,” the girl told him. “The Big Boy’s here. Brannad Klav. And a Paratime Police officer. They’re in your office.”</p>
			<p>“Uh huh; I was expecting that,” Stranor Sleth nodded. Then he turned down the corridor to the left.</p>
			<p>Two men were waiting for him, in his office. One was short and stocky, with an angry, impatient face⁠—Brannad Klav, Transtemporal’s vice president in charge of operations. The other was tall and slender with handsome and entirely expressionless features; he wore a Paratime Police officer’s uniform, with the blue badge of hereditary nobility on his breast, and carried a sigma-ray needler in a belt holster.</p>
			<p>“Were you waiting long, gentlemen?” Stranor Sleth asked. “I was holding Sunset Sacrifice up in the temple.”</p>
			<p>“No, we just got here,” Brannad Klav said. “This is Verkan Vall, Mavrad of Nerros, special assistant to Chief Tortha of the Paratime Police, Stranor Sleth, our resident agent here.”</p>
			<p>Stranor Sleth touched hands with Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>“I’ve heard a lot about you, sir,” he said. “Everybody working in paratime has, of course. I’m sorry we have a situation here that calls for your presence, but since we have, I’m glad you’re here in person. You know what our trouble is, I suppose?”</p>
			<p>“In a general way,” Verkan Vall replied. “Chief Tortha, and Brannad Klav, have given me the main outline, but I’d like to have you fill in the details.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I told you everything,” Brannad Klav interrupted impatiently. “It’s just that Stranor’s let this blasted local king, Kurchuk, get out of control. If I⁠—” He stopped short, catching sight of the shoulder holster under Stranor Sleth’s left arm. “Were you wearing that needler up in the temple?” he demanded.</p>
			<p>“You’re blasted right I was!” Stranor Sleth retorted. “And any time I can’t arm myself for my own protection on this timeline, you can have my resignation. I’m not getting into the same jam as those people at Zurb.”</p>
			<p>“Well, never mind about that,” Verkan Vall intervened. “Of course Stranor Sleth has a right to arm himself; I wouldn’t think of being caught without a weapon on this timeline, myself. Now, Stranor, suppose you tell me what’s been happening, here, from the beginning of this trouble.”</p>
			<p>“It started, really, about five years ago, when Kurchuk, the King of Zurb, married this Chuldun princess, Darith, from the country over beyond the Black Sea, and made her his queen, over the heads of about a dozen daughters of the local nobility, whom he’d married previously. Then he brought in this Chuldun scribe, Labdurg, and made him Overseer of the Kingdom⁠—roughly, prime minister. There was a lot of dissatisfaction about that, and for a while it looked as though he was going to have a revolution on his hands, but he brought in about five thousand Chuldun mercenaries, all archers⁠—these Hulguns can’t shoot a bow worth beans⁠—so the dissatisfaction died down, and so did most of the leaders of the disaffected group. The story I get is that this Labdurg arranged the marriage, in the first place. It looks to me as though the Chuldun emperor is intending to take over the Hulgun kingdoms, starting with Zurb.</p>
			<p>“Well, these Chulduns all worship a god called Muz-Azin. Muz-Azin is a crocodile with wings like a bat and a lot of knife blades in his tail. He makes this Yat-Zar look downright beautiful. So do his habits. Muz-Azin fancies human sacrifices. The victims are strung up by the ankles on a triangular frame and lashed to death with iron-barbed whips. Nasty sort of a deity, but this is a nasty timeline. The people here get a big kick out of watching these sacrifices. Much better show than our bunny-killing. The victims are usually criminals, or overage or incorrigible slaves, or prisoners of war.</p>
			<p>“Of course, when the Chulduns began infiltrating the palace, they brought in their crocodile-god, too, and a flock of priests, and King Kurchuk let them set up a temple in the palace. Naturally, we preached against this heathen idolatry in our temples, but religious bigotry isn’t one of the numerous imperfections of this sector. Everybody’s deity is as good as anybody else’s⁠—indifferentism, I believe, is the theological term. Anyhow, on that basis things went along fairly well, till two years ago, when we had this run of bad luck.”</p>
			<p>“Bad luck!” Brannad Klav snorted. “That’s the standing excuse of every incompetent!”</p>
			<p>“Go on, Stranor; what sort of bad luck?” Verkan Vall asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, first we had a drought, beginning in early summer, that burned up most of the grain crop. Then, when that broke, we got heavy rains and hailstorms and floods, and that destroyed what got through the dry spell. When they harvested what little was left, it was obvious there’d be a famine, so we brought in a lot of grain by conveyer and distributed it from the temples⁠—miraculous gift of Yat-Zar, of course. Then the main office on First Level got scared about flooding this timeline with a lot of unaccountable grain and were afraid we’d make the people suspicious, and ordered it stopped.</p>
			<p>“Then Kurchuk, and I might add that the kingdom of Zurb was the hardest hit by the famine, ordered his army mobilized and started an invasion of the Jumdun country, south of the Carpathians, to get grain. He got his army chopped up, and only about a quarter of them got back, with no grain. You ask me, I’d say that Labdurg framed it to happen that way. He advised Kurchuk to invade, in the first place, and I mentioned my suspicion that Chombrog, the Chuldun Emperor, is planning to move in on the Hulgun kingdoms. Well, what would be smarter than to get Kurchuk’s army smashed in advance?”</p>
			<p>“How did the defeat occur?” Verkan Vall asked. “Any suspicion of treachery?”</p>
			<p>“Nothing you could put your finger on, except that the Jumduns seemed to have pretty good intelligence about Kurchuk’s invasion route and battle plans. It could have been nothing worse than stupid tactics on Kurchuk’s part. See, these Hulguns, and particularly the Zurb Hulguns, are spearmen. They fight in a fairly thin line, with heavy-armed infantry in front and light infantry with throwing-spears behind. The nobles fight in light chariots, usually at the center of the line, and that’s where they were at this Battle of Jorm. Kurchuk himself was at the center, with his Chuldun archers massed around him.</p>
			<p>“The Jumduns use a lot of cavalry, with long swords and lances, and a lot of big chariots with two javelin men and a driver. Well, instead of ramming into Kurchuk’s center, where he had his archers, they hit the extreme left and folded it up, and then swung around behind and hit the right from the rear. All the Chuldun archers did was stand fast around the king and shoot anybody who came close to them: they were left pretty much alone. But the Hulgun spearmen were cut to pieces. The battle ended with Kurchuk and his nobles and his archers making a fighting retreat, while the Jumdun cavalry were chasing the spearmen every which way and cutting them down or lancing them as they ran.</p>
			<p>“Well, whether it was Labdurg’s treachery or Kurchuk’s stupidity, in either case, it was natural for the archers to come off easiest and the Hulgun spearmen to pay the butcher’s bill. But try and tell these knuckleheads anything like that! Muz-Azin protected the Chulduns, and Yat-Zar let the Hulguns down, and that was all there was to it. The Zurb temple started losing worshipers, particularly the families of the men who didn’t make it back from Jorm.</p>
			<p>“If that had been all there’d been to it, though, it still wouldn’t have hurt the mining operations, and we could have got by. But what really tore it was when the rabbits started to die.” Stranor Sleth picked up a cigar from his desk and bit the end, spitting it out disgustedly. “Tularemia, of course,” he said, touching his lighter to the tip. “When that hit, they started going over to Muz-Azin in droves, not only at Zurb but all over the Six Kingdoms. You ought to have seen the house we had for Sunset Sacrifice, this evening! About two hundred, and we used to get two thousand. It used to be all two men could do to lift the offering box at the door, afterward, and all the money we took in tonight I could put in one pocket!” The high priest used language that would have been considered unclerical even among the Hulguns.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded. Even without the quickie hypno-mech he had taken for this sector, he knew that the rabbit was domesticated among the Proto-Aryan Hulguns and was their chief meat animal. Hulgun rabbits were even a minor import on the First Level, and could be had at all the better restaurants in cities like Dhergabar. He mentioned that.</p>
			<p>“That’s not the worst of it,” Stranor Sleth told him. “See, the rabbit’s sacred to Yat-Zar. Not taboo; just sacred. They have to use a specially consecrated knife to kill them⁠—consecrating rabbit knives has always been an item of temple revenue⁠—and they must say a special prayer before eating them. We could have got around the rest of it, even the Battle of Jorm⁠—punishment by Yat-Zar for the sin of apostasy⁠—but Yat-Zar just wouldn’t make rabbits sick. Yat-Zar thinks too well of rabbits to do that, and it’d not been any use claiming he would. So there you are.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I take the attitude that this situation is the result of your incompetence,” Brannad Klav began, in a bullyragging tone. “You’re not only the high priest of this temple, you’re the acknowledged head of the religion in all the Hulgun kingdoms. You should have had more hold on the people than to allow anything like this to happen.”</p>
			<p>“Hold on the people!” Stranor Sleth fairly howled, appealing to Verkan Vall. “What does he think a religion is, on this sector, anyhow? You think these savages dreamed up that six-armed monstrosity, up there, to express their yearning for higher things, or to symbolize their moral ethos, or as a philosophical escape-hatch from the dilemma of causation? They never even heard of such matters. On this sector, gods are strictly utilitarian. As long as they take care of their worshipers, they get their sacrifices: when they can’t put out, they have to get out. How do you suppose these Chulduns, living in the Caucasus Mountains, got the idea of a god like a crocodile, anyhow? Why, they got it from Homran traders, people from down in the Nile Valley. They had a god, once, something basically like a billy goat, but he let them get licked in a couple of battles, so out he went. Why, all the deities on this sector have hyphenated names, because they’re combinations of several deities, worshiped in one person. Do you know anything about the history of this sector?” he asked the Paratime Police officer.</p>
			<p>“Well, it develops from an alternate probability of what we call the Nilo-Mesopotamian Basic sector-group,” Verkan Vall said. “On most Nilo-Mesopotamian sectors, like the Macedonian Empire Sector, or the Alexandrian-Roman or Alexandrian-Punic or Indo-Turanian or Europo-American, there was an Aryan invasion of Eastern Europe and Asia Minor about four thousand elapsed years ago. On this sector, the ancestors of the Aryans came in about fifteen centuries earlier, as neolithic savages, about the time that the Sumerian and Egyptian civilizations were first developing, and overran all southeast Europe, Asia Minor and the Nile Valley. They developed to the bronze-age culture of the civilizations they overthrew, and then, more slowly, to an iron-age culture. About two thousand years ago, they were using hardened steel and building large stone cities, just as they do now. At that time, they reached cultural stasis. But as for their religious beliefs, you’ve described them quite accurately. A god is only worshiped as long as the people think him powerful enough to aid and protect them; when they lose that confidence, he is discarded and the god of some neighboring people is adopted instead.” He turned to Brannad Klav. “Didn’t Stranor report this situation to you when it first developed?” he asked. “I know he did; he speaks of receiving shipments of grain by conveyer for temple distribution. Then why didn’t you report it to Paratime Police? That’s what we have a Paratime Police Force for.”</p>
			<p>“Well, yes, of course, but I had enough confidence in Stranor Sleth to think that he could handle the situation himself. I didn’t know he’d gone slack⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Look, I can’t make weather, even if my parishioners think I can,” Stranor Sleth defended himself. “And I can’t make a great military genius out of a blockhead like Kurchuk. And I can’t immunize all the rabbits on this timeline against tularemia, even if I’d had any reason to expect a tularemia epidemic, which I hadn’t because the disease is unknown on this sector; this is the only outbreak of it anybody’s ever heard of on any Proto-Aryan timeline.”</p>
			<p>“No, but I’ll tell you what you could have done,” Verkan Vall told him. “When this Kurchuk started to apostatize, you could have gone to him at the head of a procession of priests, all paratimers and all armed with energy-weapons, and pointed out his spiritual duty to him, and if he gave you any back talk, you could have pulled out that needler and rayed him down and then cried, ‘Behold the vengeance of Yat-Zar upon the wicked king!’ I’ll bet any sum at any odds that his successor would have thought twice about going over to Muz-Azin, and none of these other kings would have even thought once about it.”</p>
			<p>“Ha, that’s what I wanted to do!” Stranor Sleth exclaimed. “And who stopped me? I’ll give you just one guess.”</p>
			<p>“Well, it seems there was slackness here, but it wasn’t Stranor Sleth who was slack,” Verkan Vall commented.</p>
			<p>“Well! I must say; I never thought I’d hear an officer of the Paratime Police criticizing me for trying to operate inside the Paratime Transposition Code!” Brannad Klav exclaimed.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall, sitting on the edge of Stranor Sleth’s desk, aimed his cigarette at Brannad Klav like a blaster.</p>
			<p>“Now, look,” he began. “There is one, and only one, inflexible law regarding outtime activities. The secret of paratime transposition must be kept inviolate, and any activity tending to endanger it is prohibited. That’s why we don’t allow the transposition of any object of extraterrestrial origin to any timeline on which space travel has not been developed. Such an object may be preserved, and then, after the local population begin exploring the planet from whence it came, there will be dangerous speculations and theories as to how it arrived on Terra at such an early date. I came within inches, literally, of getting myself killed, not long ago, cleaning up the result of a violation of that regulation. For the same reason, we don’t allow the export, to outtime natives, of manufactured goods too far in advance of their local culture. That’s why, for instance, you people have to hand-finish all those big Yat-Zar idols, to remove traces of machine work. One of those things may be around, a few thousand years from now, when these people develop a mechanical civilization. But as far as raying down this Kurchuk is concerned, these Hulguns are completely nonscientific. They wouldn’t have the least idea what happened. They’d believe that Yat-Zar struck him dead, as gods on this plane of culture are supposed to do, and if any of them noticed the needler at all, they’d think it was just a holy amulet of some kind.”</p>
			<p>“But the law is the law⁠—” Brannad Klav began.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall shook his head. “Brannad, as I understand, you were promoted to your present position on the retirement of Salvan Marth, about ten years ago; up to that time, you were in your company’s financial department. You were accustomed to working subject to the First Level Commercial Regulation Code. Now, any law binding upon our people at home, on the First Level, is inflexible. It has to be. We found out, over fifty centuries ago, that laws have to be rigid and without discretionary powers in administration in order that people may be able to predict their effect and plan their activities accordingly. Naturally, you became conditioned to operating in such a climate of legal inflexibility.</p>
			<p>“But in paratime, the situation is entirely different. There exist, within the range of the Ghaldron-Hesthor paratemporal-field generator, a number of timelines of the order of ten to the hundred-thousandth power. In effect, that many different worlds. In the past ten thousand years, we have visited only the tiniest fraction of these, but we have found everything from timelines inhabited only by subhuman ape-men to Second Level civilizations which are our own equal in every respect but knowledge of paratemporal transposition. We even know of one Second Level civilization which is approaching the discovery of an interstellar hyperspatial drive, something we’ve never even come close to. And in between are every degree of savagery, barbarism and civilization. Now, it’s just not possible to frame any single code of laws applicable to conditions on all of these. The best we can do is prohibit certain flagrantly immoral types of activity, such as slave-trading, introduction of new types of narcotic drugs, or out-and-out piracy and brigandage. If you’re in doubt as to the legality of anything you want to do outtime, go to the Judicial Section of the Paratime Commission and get an opinion on it. That’s where you made your whole mistake. You didn’t find out just how far it was allowable for you to go.”</p>
			<p>He turned to Stranor Sleth again. “Well, that’s the background, then. Now tell me about what happened yesterday at Zurb.”</p>
			<p>“Well, a week ago, Kurchuk came out with this decree closing our temple at Zurb and ordering his subjects to perform worship and make money offerings to Muz-Azin. The Zurb temple isn’t a mask for a mine: Zurb’s too far south for the uranium deposits. It’s just a center for propaganda and that sort of thing. But they have a House of Yat-Zar, and a conveyer, and most of the upper-priests are paratimers. Well, our man there, Tammand Drav, alias Khoram, defied the king’s order, so Kurchuk sent a company of Chuldun archers to close the temple and arrest the priests. Tammand Drav got all his people who were in the temple at the time into the House of Yat-Zar and transposed them back to the First Level. He had orders”⁠—Stranor Sleth looked meaningly at Brannad Klav⁠—“not to resist with energy-weapons or even ultrasonic paralyzers. And while we’re on the subject of letting the local yokels see too much, about fifteen of the under-priests he took to the First Level were Hulgun natives.”</p>
			<p>“Nothing wrong about that: they’ll get memory-obliteration and pseudo-memory treatment,” Verkan Vall said. “But he should have been allowed to needle about a dozen of those Chulduns. Teach the beggars to respect Yat-Zar in the future. Now, how about the six priests who were outside the temple at the time? All but one were paratimers. We’ll have to find out about them, and get them out of Zurb.”</p>
			<p>“That’ll take some doing,” Stranor Sleth said. “And it’ll have to be done before sunset tomorrow. They are all in the dungeon of the palace citadel, and Kurchuk is going to give them to the priests of Muz-Azin to be sacrificed tomorrow evening.”</p>
			<p>“How’d you learn that?” Verkan Vall asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, we have a man in Zurb, not connected with the temple,” Stranor Sleth said. “Name’s Crannar Jurth; calls himself Kranjur, locally. He has a swordmaker’s shop, employs about a dozen native journeymen and apprentices who hammer out the common blades he sells in the open market. Then, he imports a few high-class alloy-steel blades from the First Level, that’ll cut through this local low-carbon armor like cheese. Fits them with locally-made hilts and sells them at unbelievable prices to the nobility. He’s Swordsmith to the King; picks up all the inside palace dope. Of course, he was among the first to accept the New Gospel and go over to Muz-Azin. He has a secret room under his shop, with his conveyer and a radio.</p>
			<p>“What happened was this: These six priests were at a consecration ceremony at a rabbit-ranch outside the city, and they didn’t know about the raid on the temple. On their way back, they were surrounded by Chuldun archers and taken prisoner. They had no weapons but their sacrificial knives.” He threw another dirty look at Brannad Klav. “So they’re due to go up on the triangles at sunset tomorrow.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll have to get them out before then,” Verkan Vall stated. “They’re our people, and we can’t let them down; even the native is under our protection, whether he knows it or not. And in the second place, if those priests are sacrificed to Muz-Azin,” he told Brannad Klav, “you can shut down everything on this timeline, pull out or disintegrate your installations, and fill in your mine-tunnels. Yat-Zar will be through on this timeline, and you’ll be through along with him. And considering that your fissionables franchise for this sector comes up for renewal next year, your company will be through in this paratime area.”</p>
			<p>“You believe that would happen?” Brannad Klav asked anxiously.</p>
			<p>“I know it will, because I’ll put through a recommendation to that effect, if those six men are tortured to death tomorrow,” Verkan Vall replied. “And in the fifty years that I’ve been in the Police Department, I’ve only heard of five such recommendations being ignored by the commission. You know, Fourth Level Mineral Products Syndicate is after your franchise. Ordinarily, they wouldn’t have a chance of getting it, but with this, maybe they will, even without my recommendation. This was all your fault, for ignoring Stranor Sleth’s proposal and for denying those men the right to carry energy weapons.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we were only trying to stay inside the Paratime Code,” Brannad Klav pleaded. “If it isn’t too late, now, you can count on me for every cooperation.” He fiddled with some papers on the desk. “What do you want me to do to help?”</p>
			<p>“I’ll tell you that in a minute.” Verkan Vall walked to the wall and looked at the map, then returned to Stranor Sleth’s desk. “How about these dungeons?” he asked. “How are they located, and how can we get in to them?”</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid we can’t,” Stranor Sleth told him. “Not without fighting our way in. They’re under the palace citadel, a hundred feet below ground. They’re spatially coexistent with the heavy water barriers around one of our company’s plutonium piles on the First Level, and below surface on any unoccupied timeline I know of, so we can’t transpose in to them. This palace is really a walled city inside a city. Here, I’ll show you.”</p>
			<p>Going around the desk, he sat down and, after looking in the index-screen, punched a combination on the keyboard. A picture, projected from the microfilm-bank, appeared on the viewscreen. It was an air-view of the city of Zurb⁠—taken, the high priest explained, by infrared light from an airboat over the city at night. It showed a city of an entirely pre-mechanical civilization, with narrow streets, lined on either side by low one and two story buildings. Although there would be considerable snow in winter, the roofs were usually flat, probably massive stone slabs supported by pillars within. Even in the poorer sections, this was true except for the very meanest houses and outbuildings, which were thatched. Here and there, some huge pile of masonry would rear itself above its lower neighbors, and, where the streets were wider, occasional groups of large buildings would be surrounded by battlemented walls. Stranor Sleth indicated one of the larger of these.</p>
			<p>“Here’s the palace,” he said. “And here’s the temple of Yat-Zar, about half a mile away.” He touched a large building, occupying an entire block; between it and the palace was a block-wide park, with lawns and trees on either side of a wide roadway connecting the two.</p>
			<p>“Now, here’s a detailed view of the palace.” He punched another combination; the view of the City was replaced by one, taken from directly overhead, of the walled palace area. “Here’s the main gate, in front, at the end of the road from the temple,” he pointed out. “Over here, on the left, are the slaves’ quarters and the stables and workshops and store houses and so on. Over here, on the other side, are the nobles’ quarters. And this,”⁠—he indicated a towering structure at the rear of the walled enclosure⁠—“is the citadel and the royal dwelling. Audience hall on this side; harem over here on this side. A wide stone platform, about fifteen feet high, runs completely across the front of the citadel, from the audience hall to the harem. Since this picture was taken, the new temple of Muz-Azin was built right about here.” He indicated that it extended out from the audience hall into the central courtyard. “And out here on the platform, they’ve put up about a dozen of these triangles, about twelve feet high, on which the sacrificial victims are whipped to death.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. About the only way we could get down to the dungeons would be to make an airdrop onto the citadel roof and fight our way down with needlers and blasters, and I’m not willing to do that as long as there’s any other way,” Verkan Vall said. “We’d lose men, even with needlers against bows, and there’s a chance that some of our equipment might be lost in the melee and fall into outtime hands. You say this sacrifice comes off tomorrow at sunset?”</p>
			<p>“That would be about actual sunset plus or minus an hour; these people aren’t astronomers, they don’t even have good sundials, and it might be a cloudy day,” Stranor Sleth said. “There will be a big idol of Muz-Azin on a cart, set about here.” He pointed. “After the sacrifice, it is to be dragged down this road, outside, to the temple of Yat-Zar, and set up there. The temple is now occupied by about twenty Chuldun mercenaries and five or six priests of Muz-Azin. They haven’t, of course, got into the House of Yat-Zar; the door’s of impervium steel, about six inches thick, with a plating of collapsed nickel under the gilding. It would take a couple of hours to cut through it with our best atomic torch; there isn’t a tool on this timeline that could even scratch it. And the insides of the walls are lined with the same thing.”</p>
			<p>“Do you think our people have been tortured, yet?” Verkan Vall asked.</p>
			<p>“No.” Stranor Sleth was positive. “They’ll be fairly well treated, until the sacrifice. The idea’s to make them last as long as possible on the triangles; Muz-Azin likes to see a slow killing, and so does the mob of spectators.”</p>
			<p>“That’s good. Now, here’s my plan. We won’t try to rescue them from the dungeons. Instead, we’ll transpose back to the Zurb temple from the First Level, in considerable force⁠—say a hundred or so men⁠—and march on the palace, to force their release. You’re in constant radio communication with all the other temples on this timeline, I suppose?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, certainly.”</p>
			<p>“All right. Pass this out to everybody, authority Paratime Police, in my name, acting for Tortha Karf. I want all paratimers who can possibly be spared to transpose to First Level immediately and rendezvous at the First Level terminal of the Zurb temple conveyer as soon as possible. Close down all mining operations, and turn over temple routine to the native under-priests. You can tell them that the upper-priests are retiring to their respective Houses of Yat-Zar to pray for the deliverance of the priests in the hands of King Kurchuk. And everybody is to bring back his priestly regalia to the First Level; that will be needed.” He turned to Brannad Klav. “I suppose you keep spare regalia in stock on the First Level?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course; we keep plenty of everything in stock. Robes, miters, false beards of different shades, everything.”</p>
			<p>“And these big Yat-Zar idols: they’re mass-produced on the First Level? You have one available now? Good. I’ll want some alterations made on one. For one thing, I’ll want it plated heavily, all over, with collapsed nickel. For another, I’ll want it fitted with antigrav units and some sort of propulsion-units, and a loudspeaker, and remote control.</p>
			<p>“And, Stranor, you get in touch with this swordmaker, Crannar Jurth, and alert him to cooperate with us. Tell him to start calling Zurb temple on his radio about noon tomorrow, and keep it up till he gets an answer. Or, better, tell him to run his conveyer to his First Level terminal, and bring with him an extra suit of clothes appropriate to the role of journeyman-mechanic. I’ll want to talk to him, and furnish him with special equipment. Got all that? Well, carry on with it, and bring your own paratimers, priests and mining operators, back with you as soon as you’ve taken care of everything. Brannad, you come with me, now. We’re returning to First Level immediately. We have a lot of work to do, so let’s get started.”</p>
			<p>“Anything I can do to help, just call on me for it,” Brannad Klav promised earnestly. “And, Stranor, I want to apologize. I’ll admit, now, that I ought to have followed your recommendations, when this situation first developed.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>By noon of the next day, Verkan Vall had at least a hundred men gathered in the big room at the First Level fissionables refinery at Jarnabar, spatially coexistent with the Fourth Level temple of Yat-Zar at Zurb. He was having a little trouble distinguishing between them, for every man wore the fringed blue robe and golden miter of an upper-priest, and had his face masked behind a blue false beard. It was, he admitted to himself, a most ludicrous-looking assemblage; one of the most ludicrous things about it was the fact that it would have inspired only pious awe in a Hulgun of the Fourth Level Proto-Aryan Sector. About half of them were priests from the Transtemporal Mining Corporation’s temples; the other half were members of the Paratime Police. All of them wore, in addition to their temple knives, holstered sigma-ray needlers. Most of them carried ultrasonic paralyzers, eighteen-inch batonlike things with bulbous ends. Most of the Paratime Police and a few of the priests also carried either heat-ray pistols or neutron-disruption blasters; Verkan Vall wore one of the latter in a left-hand belt holster.</p>
			<p>The Paratime Police were lined up separately for inspection, and Stranor Sleth, Tammand Drav of the Zurb temple, and several other high priests were checking the authenticity of their disguises. A little apart from the others, a Paratime Policeman, in high priest’s robes and beard, had a square box slung in front of him; he was fiddling with knobs and buttons on it, practicing. A big idol of Yat-Zar, on antigravity, was floating slowly about the room in obedience to its remote controls, rising and lowering, turning about and pirouetting gracefully.</p>
			<p>“Hey, Vall!” he called to his superior. “How’s this?”</p>
			<p>The idol rose about five feet, turned slowly in a half-circle, moved to the right a little, and then settled slowly toward the floor.</p>
			<p>“Fine, fine, Horv,” Verkan Vall told him, “but don’t set it down on anything, or turn off the antigravity. There’s enough collapsed nickel-plating on that thing to sink it a yard in soft ground.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what the idea of that was,” Brannad Klav, standing beside him, said. “Understand, I’m not criticizing. I haven’t any right to, under the circumstances. But it seems to me that armoring that thing in collapsed nickel was an unnecessary precaution.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe it was,” Verkan Vall agreed. “I sincerely hope so. But we can’t take any chances. This operation has to be absolutely right. Ready, Tammand? All right; first detail into the conveyer.”</p>
			<p>He turned and strode toward a big dome of fine metallic mesh, thirty feet high and sixty in diameter, at the other end of the room. Tammand Drav, and his ten paratimer priests, and Brannad Klav, and ten Paratime Police, followed him in. One of the latter slid shut the door and locked it; Verkan Vall went to the control desk, at the center of the dome, and picked up a two-foot globe of the same fine metallic mesh, opening it and making some adjustments inside, then attaching an electric cord and closing it. He laid the globe on the floor near the desk and picked up the hand battery at the other end of the attached cord.</p>
			<p>“Not taking any chances at all, are you?” Brannad Klav asked, watching this operation with interest.</p>
			<p>“I never do, unnecessarily. There are too many necessary chances that have to be taken, in this work.” Verkan Vall pressed the button on the hand battery. The globe on the floor flashed and vanished. “Yesterday, five paratimers were arrested. Any or all of them could have had door-activators with them. Stranor Sleth says they were not tortured, but that is a purely inferential statement. They may have been, and the use of the activator may have been extorted from one of them. So I want a look at the inside of that conveyer-chamber before we transpose into it.”</p>
			<p>He laid the hand battery, with the loose-dangling wire that had been left behind, on the desk, then lit a cigarette. The others gathered around, smoking and watching, careful to avoid the place from which the globe had vanished. Thirty minutes passed, and then, in a queer iridescence, the globe reappeared. Verkan Vall counted ten seconds and picked it up, taking it to the desk and opening it to remove a small square box. This he slid into a space under the desk and flipped a switch. Instantly, a viewscreen lit up and a three-dimensional picture appeared⁠—the interior of a big room a hundred feet square and some seventy in height. There was a big desk and a radio; tables, couches, chairs and an arms-rack full of weapons, and at one end, a remarkably clean sixty-foot circle on the concrete floor, outlined in faintly luminous red.</p>
			<p>“How about it?” Verkan Vall asked Tammand Drav. “Anything wrong?”</p>
			<p>The Zurb high priest shook his head. “Just as we left it,” he said. “Nobody’s been inside since we left.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>One of the policemen took Verkan Vall’s place at the control desk and threw the master switch, after checking the instruments. Immediately, the paratemporal-transposition field went on with a humming sound that mounted to a high scream, then settled to a steady drone. The mesh dome flickered with a cold iridescence and vanished, and they were looking into the interior of a great fissionables refinery plant, operated by paratimers on another First Level timeline. The structural details altered, from timeline to timeline, as they watched. Buildings appeared and vanished. Once, for a few seconds, they were inside a cool, insulated bubble in the midst of molten lead. Tammand Drav jerked a thumb at it, before it vanished.</p>
			<p>“That always bothers me,” he said. “Bad place for the field to go weak. I’m fussy as an old hen about inspection of the conveyer, on account of that.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t blame you,” Verkan Vall agreed. “Probably the cooling system of a breeder-pile.”</p>
			<p>They passed more swiftly, now, across the Second Level and the Third. Once they were in the midst of a huge land battle, with great tanklike vehicles spouting flame at one another. Another moment was spent in an air bombardment. On any timeline, this section of East Europe was a natural battleground. Once a great procession marched toward them, carrying red banners and huge pictures of a coarse-faced man with a black mustache⁠—Verkan Vall recognized the environment as Fourth Level Europo-American Sector. Finally, as the transposition-rate slowed, they saw a clutter of miserable thatched huts, in the rear of a granite wall of a Fourth Level Hulgun temple of Yat-Zar⁠—a temple not yet infiltrated by Transtemporal Mining Corporation agents. Finally, they were at their destination. The dome around them became visible, and an overhead green light flashed slowly on and off.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall opened the door and stepped outside, his needler drawn. The House of Yat-Zar was just as he had seen it in the picture photographed by the automatic reconnaissance-conveyer. The others crowded outside after him. One of the regular priests pulled off his miter and beard and went to the radio, putting on a headset. Verkan Vall and Tammand Drav snapped on the visiscreen, getting a view of the Holy of Holies outside.</p>
			<p>There were six men there, seated at the upper-priests’ banquet table, drinking from golden goblets. Five of them wore the black robes with green facings which marked them as priests of Muz-Azin; the sixth was an officer of the Chuldun archers, in gilded mail and helmet.</p>
			<p>“Why, those are the sacred vessels of the temple!” Tammand Drav cried, scandalized. Then he laughed in self-ridicule. “I’m beginning to take this stuff seriously, myself; time I put in for a long vacation. I was actually shocked at the sacrilege!”</p>
			<p>“Well, let’s overtake the infidels in their sins,” Verkan Vall said. “Paralyzers will be good enough.”</p>
			<p>He picked up one of the bulb-headed weapons, and unlocked the door. Tammand Drav and another of the priests of the Zurb temple following and the others crowding behind, they passed out through the veils, and burst into the Holy of Holies. Verkan Vall pointed the bulb of his paralyzer at the six seated men and pressed the button; other paralyzers came into action, and the whole sextet were knocked senseless. The officer rolled from his chair and fell to the floor in a clatter of armor. Two of the priests slumped forward on the table. The others merely sank back in their chairs, dropping their goblets.</p>
			<p>“Give each one of them another dose, to make sure,” Verkan Vall directed a couple of his own men. “Now, Tammand; any other way into the main temple beside that door?”</p>
			<p>“Up those steps,” Tammand Drav pointed. “There’s a gallery along the side; we can cover the whole room from there.”</p>
			<p>“Take your men and go up there. I’ll take a few through the door. There’ll be about twenty archers out there, and we don’t want any of them loosing any arrows before we can knock them out. Three minutes be time enough?”</p>
			<p>“Easily. Make it two,” Tammand Drav said.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He took his priests up the stairway and vanished into the gallery of the temple. Verkan Vall waited until one minute had passed and then, followed by Brannad Klav and a couple of Paratime Policemen, he went under the plinth and peered out into the temple. Five or six archers, in steel caps and sleeveless leather jackets sewn with steel rings, were gathered around the altar, cooking something in a pot on the fire. Most of the others, like veteran soldiers, were sprawled on the floor, trying to catch a short nap, except half a dozen, who crouched in a circle, playing some game with dice⁠—another almost universal military practice.</p>
			<p>The two minutes were up. He aimed his paralyzer at the men around the altar and squeezed the button, swinging it from one to another and knocking them down with a bludgeon of inaudible sound. At the same time, Tammand Drav and his detail were stunning the gamblers. Stepping forward and to one side, Verkan Vall, Brannad Klav and the others took care of the sleepers on the floor. In less than thirty seconds, every Chuldun in the temple was incapacitated.</p>
			<p>“All right, make sure none of them come out of it prematurely,” Verkan Vall directed. “Get their weapons, and be sure nobody has a knife or anything hidden on him. Who has the syringe and the sleep-drug ampoules?”</p>
			<p>Somebody had, it developed, who was still on the First Level, to come up with the second conveyer load. Verkan Vall swore. Something like this always happened, on any operation involving more than half a dozen men.</p>
			<p>“Well, some of you stay here: patrol around, and use your paralyzers on anybody who even twitches a muscle.” Ultrasonics were nice, effective, humane police weapons, but they were unreliable. The same dose that would keep one man out for an hour would paralyze another for no more than ten or fifteen minutes. “And be sure none of them are playing ‘possum.’ ”</p>
			<p>He went back through the door under the plinth, glancing up at the decorated wooden screen and wondering how much work it would take to move the new Yat-Zar in from the conveyers. The five priests and the archer-captain were still unconscious; one of the policemen was searching them.</p>
			<p>“Here’s the sort of weapons these priests carry,” he said, holding up a short iron mace with a spiked head. “Carry them on their belts.” He tossed it on the table, and began searching another knocked-out hierophant. “Like this⁠—<em>Hey!</em> Look at this, will you!”</p>
			<p>He drew his hand from under the left side of the senseless man’s robe and held up a sigma-ray needler. Verkan Vall looked at it and nodded grimly.</p>
			<p>“Had it in a regular shoulder holster,” the policeman said, handing the weapon across the table. “What do you think?”</p>
			<p>“Find anything else funny on him?”</p>
			<p>“Wait a minute.” The policeman pulled open the robe and began stripping the priest of Muz-Azin; Verkan Vall came around the table to help. There was nothing else of a suspicious nature.</p>
			<p>“Could have got it from one of the prisoners, but I don’t like the familiar way he’s wearing that holster,” Verkan Vall said. “Has the conveyer gone back, yet?” When the policeman nodded, he continued: “When it returns, take him to the First Level. I hope they bring up the sleep-drug with the next load. When you get him back, take him to Dhergabar by strato-rocket immediately, and make sure he gets back alive. I want him questioned under narco-hypnosis by a regular Paratime Commission psycho-technician, in the presence of Chief Tortha Karf and some responsible Commission official. This is going to be hot stuff.”</p>
			<p>Within an hour, the whole force was assembled in the temple. The wooden screen had presented no problem⁠—it slid easily to one side⁠—and the big idol floated on antigravity in the middle of the temple. Verkan Vall was looking anxiously at his watch.</p>
			<p>“It’s about two hours to sunset,” he said, to Stranor Sleth. “But as you pointed out, these Hulguns aren’t astronomers, and it’s a bit cloudy. I wish Crannar Jurth would call in with something definite.”</p>
			<p>Another twenty minutes passed. Then the man at the radio came out into the temple.</p>
			<p>“OK!” he called. “The man at Crannar Jurth’s called in. Crannar Jurth contacted him with a midget radio he has up his sleeve; he’s in the palace courtyard now. They haven’t brought out the victims, yet, but Kurchuk has just been carried out on his throne to that platform in front of the citadel. Big crowd gathering in the inner courtyard; more in the streets outside. Palace gates are wide open.”</p>
			<p>“That’s it!” Verkan Vall cried. “Form up; the parade’s starting. Brannad, you and Tammand and Stranor and I in front; about ten men with paralyzers a little behind us. Then Yat-Zar, about ten feet off the ground, and then the others. Forward⁠—<em>ho-o!</em>”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They emerged from the temple and started down the broad roadway toward the palace. There was not much of a crowd, at first. Most of Zurb had flocked to the palace earlier; the lucky ones in the courtyard and the late comers outside. Those whom they did meet stared at them in open-mouthed amazement, and then some, remembering their doubts and blasphemies, began howling for forgiveness. Others⁠—a substantial majority⁠—realizing that it would be upon King Kurchuk that the real weight of Yat-Zar’s six hands would fall, took to their heels, trying to put as much distance as possible between them and the palace before the blow fell.</p>
			<p>As the procession approached the palace gates, the crowds were thicker, made up of those who had been unable to squeeze themselves inside. The panic was worse, here, too. A good many were trampled and hurt in the rush to escape, and it became necessary to use paralyzers to clear a way. That made it worse: everybody was sure that Yat-Zar was striking sinners dead left and right.</p>
			<p>Fortunately, the gates were high enough to let the god through without losing altitude appreciably. Inside, the mob surged back, clearing a way across the courtyard. It was only necessary to paralyze a few here, and the levitated idol and its priestly attendants advanced toward the stone platform, where the king sat on his throne, flanked by court functionaries and black-robed priests of Muz-Azin. In front of this, a rank of Chuldun archers had been drawn up.</p>
			<p>“Horv; move Yat-Zar forward about a hundred feet and up about fifty,” Verkan Vall directed. “Quickly!”</p>
			<p>As the six-armed anthropomorphic idol rose and moved closer toward its saurian rival, Verkan Vall drew his needler, scanning the assemblage around the throne anxiously.</p>
			<p>“<em>Where is the wicked King?</em>” a voice thundered⁠—the voice of Stranor Sleth, speaking into a midget radio tuned to the loudspeaker inside the idol. “<em>Where is the blasphemer and desecrator, Kurchuk?</em>”</p>
			<p>“There’s Labdurg, in the red tunic, beside the throne,” Tammand Drav whispered. “And that’s Ghromdur, the Muz-Azin high priest, beside him.”</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall nodded, keeping his eyes on the group on the platform. Ghromdur, the high priest of Muz-Azin, was edging backward and reaching under his robe. At the same time, an officer shouted an order, and the Chuldun archers drew arrows from their quivers and fitted them to their bowstrings. Immediately, the ultrasonic paralyzers of the advancing paratimers went into action, and the mercenaries began dropping.</p>
			<p>“<em>Lay down your weapons, fools!</em>” the amplified voice boomed at them. “<em>Lay down your weapons or you shall surely die! Who are you, miserable wretches, to draw bows against Me?</em>”</p>
			<p>At first a few, then all of them, the Chulduns lowered or dropped their weapons and began edging away to the sides. At the center, in front of the throne, most of them had been knocked out. Verkan Vall was still watching the Muz-Azin high priest intently; as Ghromdur raised his arm, there was a flash and a puff of smoke from the front of Yat-Zar⁠—the paint over the collapsed nickel was burned off, but otherwise the idol was undamaged. Verkan Vall swung up his needler and rayed Ghromdur dead; as the man in the green-faced black robes fell, a blaster clattered on the stone platform.</p>
			<p>“<em>Is that your puny best, Muz-Azin?</em>” the booming voice demanded. “<em>Where is your high priest now?</em>”</p>
			<p>“Horv; face Yat-Zar toward Muz-Azin,” Verkan Vall said over his shoulder, drawing his blaster with his left hand. Like all First Level people, he was ambidextrous, although, like all paratimers, he habitually concealed the fact while outtime. As the levitated idol swung slowly to look down upon its enemy on the built-up cart, Verkan Vall aimed the blaster and squeezed.</p>
			<p>In a spot less than a millimeter in diameter on the crocodile idol’s side, a certain number of neutrons in the atomic structure of the stone from which it was carved broke apart, becoming, in effect, atoms of hydrogen. With a flash and a bang, the idol burst and vanished. Yat-Zar gave a dirty laugh and turned his back on the cart, which was now burning fiercely facing King Kurchuk again.</p>
			<p>“Get your hands up, all of you!” Verkan Vall shouted, in the First Level language, swinging the stubby muzzle of the blaster and the knob-tipped twin tubes of the needler to cover the group around the throne, “Come forward, before I start blasting!”</p>
			<p>Labdurg raised his hands and stepped forward. So did two of the priests of Yat-Zar. They were quickly seized by Paratime Policemen who swarmed up onto the platform and disarmed. All three were carrying sigma-ray needlers, and Labdurg had a blaster as well.</p>
			<p>King Kurchuk was clinging to the arms of his throne, a badly frightened monarch trying desperately not to show it. He was a big man, heavy-shouldered, black-bearded; under ordinary circumstances he would probably have cut an imposing figure, in his gold-washed mail and his golden crown. Now his face was a dirty gray, and he was biting nervously at his lower lip. The others on the platform were in even worse state. The Hulgun nobles were grouped together, trying to disassociate themselves from both the king and the priests of Muz-Azin. The latter were staring in a daze at the blazing cart from which their idol had just been blasted. And the dozen men who were to have done the actual work of the torture-sacrifice had all dropped their whips and were fairly gibbering in fear.</p>
			<p>Yat-Zar, manipulated by the robed paratimer, had taken a position directly above the throne and was lowering slowly. Kurchuk stared up at the massive idol descending toward him, his knuckles white as he clung to the arms of his throne. He managed to hold out until he could feel the weight of the idol pressing on his head. Then, with a scream, he hurled himself from the throne and rolled forward almost to the edge of the platform. Yat-Zar moved to one side, swung slightly and knocked the throne toppling, and then settled down on the platform. To Kurchuk, who was rising cautiously on his hands and knees, the big idol seemed to be looking at him in contempt.</p>
			<p>“<em>Where are my holy priests, Kurchuk?</em>” Stranor Sleth demanded in to his sleeve-hidden radio. “<em>Let them be brought before me, alive and unharmed, or it shall be better for you had you never been born!</em>”</p>
			<p>The six priests of Yat-Zar, it seemed, were already being brought onto the platform by one of Kurchuk’s nobles. This noble, whose name was Yorzuk, knew a miracle when he saw one, and believed in being on the side of the god with the heaviest artillery. As soon as he had seen Yat-Zar coming through the gate without visible means of support, he had hastened to the dungeons with half a dozen of his personal retainers and ordered the release of the six captives. He was now escorting them onto the platform, assuring them that he had always been a faithful servant of Yat-Zar and had been deeply grieved at his sovereign’s apostasy.</p>
			<p>“<em>Hear my word, Kurchuk</em>,” Stranor Sleth continued through the loudspeaker in the idol. “<em>You have sinned most vilely against me, and were I a cruel god, your fate would be such as no man has ever before suffered. But I am a merciful god; behold, you may gain forgiveness in my sight. For thirty days, you shall neither eat meat nor drink wine, nor shall you wear gold nor fine raiment, and each day shall you go to my temple and beseech me for my forgiveness. And on the thirty-first day, you shall set out, barefoot and clad in the garb of a slave, and journey to my temple that is in the mountains over above Yoldav, and there will I forgive you, after you have made sacrifice to me. I, Yat-Zar, have spoken!</em>”</p>
			<p>The king started to rise, babbling thanks.</p>
			<p>“<em>Rise not before me until I have forgiven you!</em>” Yat-Zar thundered. “<em>Creep out of my sight upon your belly, wretch!</em>”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The procession back to the temple was made quietly and sedately along an empty roadway. Yat-Zar seemed to be in a kindly humor; the people of Zurb had no intention of giving him any reason to change his mood. The priests of Muz-Azin and their torturers had been flung into the dungeon. Yorzuk, appointed regent for the duration of Kurchuk’s penance, had taken control and was employing Hulgun spearmen and hastily-converted Chuldun archers to restore order and, incidentally, purge a few of his personal enemies and political rivals. The priests, with the three prisoners who had been found carrying First Level weapons among them and Yat-Zar floating triumphantly in front, entered the temple. A few of the devout, who sought admission after them, were told that elaborate and secret rites were being held to cleanse the profaned altar, and sent away.</p>
			<p>Verkan Vall and Brannad Klav and Stranor Sleth were in the conveyer chamber, with the Paratime Policemen and the extra priests; along with them were the three prisoners. Verkan Vall pulled off his false beard and turned to face these. He could see that they all recognized him.</p>
			<p>“Now,” he began, “you people are in a bad jam. You’ve violated the Paratime Transposition Code, the Commercial Regulation Code, and the First Level Criminal Code, all together. If you know what’s good for you, you’ll start talking.”</p>
			<p>“I’m not saying anything till I have legal advice,” the man who had been using the local alias of Labdurg replied. “And if you’re through searching me, I’d like to have my cigarettes and lighter back.”</p>
			<p>“Smoke one of mine, for a change,” Verkan Vall told him. “I don’t know what’s in yours beside tobacco.” He offered his case and held a light for the prisoner before lighting his own cigarette. “I’m going to be sure you get back to the First Level alive.”</p>
			<p>The former Overseer of the Kingdom of Zurb shrugged. “I’m still not talking,” he said.</p>
			<p>“Well, we can get it all out of you by narco-hypnosis, anyhow,” Verkan Vall told him. “Besides, we got that man of yours who was here at the temple when we came in. He’s being given a full treatment, as a presumed outtime native found in possession of First Level weapons. If you talk now it’ll go easier with you.”</p>
			<p>The prisoner dropped the cigarette on the floor and tramped it out.</p>
			<p>“Anything you cops get out of me, you’ll have to get the hard way,” he said. “I have friends on the First Level who’ll take care of me.”</p>
			<p>“I doubt that. They’ll have their hands full taking care of themselves, after this gets out.” Verkan Vall turned to the two in the black robes. “Either of you want to say anything?” When they shook their heads, he nodded to a group of his policemen; they were hustled into the conveyer. “Take them to the First Level terminal and hold them till I come in. I’ll be along with the next conveyer load.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The conveyer flashed and vanished. Brannad Klav stared for a moment at the circle of concrete floor from whence it had disappeared. Then he turned to Verkan Vall.</p>
			<p>“I still can’t believe it,” he said. “Why, those fellows were First Level paratimers. So was that priest, Ghromdur: the one you rayed.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course. They worked for your rivals, the Fourth Level Mineral Products Syndicate; the outfit that was trying to get your Proto-Aryan Sector fissionables franchise away from you. They operate on this sector already; have the petroleum franchise for the Chuldun country, east of the Caspian Sea. They export to some of these internal-combustion-engine sectors, like Europo-American. You know, most of the wars they’ve been fighting, lately, on the Europo-American Sector have been, at least in part, motivated by rivalry for oil fields. But now that the Europo-Americans have begun to release nuclear energy, fissionables have become more important than oil. In less than a century, it’s predicted that atomic energy will replace all other forms of power. Mineral Products Syndicate wanted to get a good source of supply for uranium, and your Proto-Aryan Sector franchise was worth grabbing.</p>
			<p>“I had considered something like this as a possibility when Stranor, here, mentioned that tularemia was normally unknown in Eurasia on this sector. That epidemic must have been started by imported germs. And I knew that Mineral Products has agents at the court of the Chuldun emperor, Chombrog: they have to, to protect their oil wells on his eastern frontiers. I spent most of last night checking up on some stuff by video-transcription from the Paratime Commission’s microfilm library at Dhergabar. I found out, for one thing, that while there is a King Kurchuk of Zurb on every timeline for a hundred parayears on either side of this one, this is the only timeline on which he married a Princess Darith of Chuldun, and it’s the only timeline on which there is any trace of a Chuldun scribe named Labdurg.</p>
			<p>“That’s why I went to all the trouble of having that Yat-Zar plated with collapsed nickel. If there were disguised paratimers among the Muz-Azin party at Kurchuk’s court, I expected one of them to try to blast our idol when we brought it into the palace. I was watching Ghromdur and Labdurg in particular; as soon as Ghromdur used his blaster, I needled him. After that, it was easy.”</p>
			<p>“Was that why you insisted on sending that automatic viewer on ahead?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. There was a chance that they might have planted a bomb in the House of Yat-Zar, here. I knew they’d either do that or let the place entirely alone. I suppose they were so confident of getting away with this that they didn’t want to damage the conveyer or the conveyer chamber. They expected to use them, themselves, after they took over your company’s franchise.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what’s going to be done about it by the Commission?” Brannad Klav wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“Plenty. The syndicate will probably lose their paratime license; any of its officials who had guilty knowledge of this will be dealt with according to law. You know, this was a pretty nasty business.”</p>
			<p>“You’re telling me!” Stranor Sleth exclaimed. “Did you get a look at those whips they were going to use on our people? Pointed iron barbs a quarter-inch long braided into them, all over the lash-ends!”</p>
			<p>“Yes. Any punitive action you’re thinking about taking on these priests of Muz-Azin⁠—the natives, I mean⁠—will be ignored on the First Level. And that reminds me: you’d better work out a line of policy, pretty soon.”</p>
			<p>“Well, as for the priests and the torturers, I think I’ll tell Yorzuk to have them sold to the Bhunguns, to the east. They’re always in the market for galley slaves,” Stranor Sleth said. He turned to Brannad Klav. “And I’ll want six gold crowns made up, as soon as possible. Strictly Hulgun design, with Yat-Zar religious symbolism, very rich and ornate, all slightly different. When I give Kurchuk absolution, I’ll crown him at the altar in the name of Yat-Zar. Then I’ll invite in the other five Hulgun kings, lecture them on their religious duties, make them confess their secret doubts, forgive them, and crown them, too. From then on, they can all style themselves as ruling by the will of Yat-Zar.”</p>
			<p>“And from then on, you’ll have all of them eating out of your hand,” Verkan Vall concluded. “You know, this will probably go down in Hulgun history as the Reformation of Ghullam the Holy. I’ve always wondered whether the theory of the divine right of kings was invented by the kings, to establish their authority over the people, or by the priests, to establish <em>their</em> authority over the kings. It works about as well one way as the other.”</p>
			<p>“What I can’t understand is this,” Brannad Klav said. “It was entirely because of my respect for the Paratime Code that I kept Stranor Sleth from using Fourth Level weapons and other techniques to control these people with a show of apparent miraculous powers. But this Fourth Level Mineral Products Syndicate was operating in violation of the Paratime Code by invading our franchise area. Why didn’t they fake up a supernatural reign of terror to intimidate these natives?”</p>
			<p>“Ha, exactly because they <em>were</em> operating illegally,” Verkan Vall replied. “Suppose they had started using needlers and blasters and antigravity and nuclear-energy around here. The natives would have thought it was the power of Muz-Azin, of course, but what would you have thought? You’d have known, as soon as they tried it, that First Level paratimers were working against you, and you’d have laid the facts before the Commission, and this timeline would have been flooded with Paratime Police. They had to conceal their operations not only from the natives, as you do, but also from us. So they didn’t dare make public use of First Level techniques.</p>
			<p>“Of course, when we came marching into the palace with that idol on antigravity, they knew, at once, what was happening. I have an idea that they only tried to blast that idol to create a diversion which would permit them to escape⁠—if they could have got out of the palace, they’d have made their way, in disguise, to the nearest Mineral Products Syndicate conveyer and transposed out of here. I realized that they could best delay us by blasting our idol, and that’s why I had it plated with collapsed nickel. I think that where they made their mistake was in allowing Kurchuk to have those priests arrested, and insisting on sacrificing them to Muz-Azin. If it hadn’t been for that, the Paratime Police wouldn’t have been brought into this, at all.</p>
			<p>“Well, Stranor, you’ll want to get back to your temple, and Brannad and I want to get back to the First Level. I’m supposed to take my wife to a banquet in Dhergabar, tonight, and with the fastest strato-rocket, I’ll just barely make it.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Answer</h2>
			<p>For a moment, after the screen door snapped and wakened him, Lee Richardson sat breathless and motionless, his eyes still closed, trying desperately to cling to the dream and print it upon his conscious memory before it faded.</p>
			<p>“Are you there, Lee?” he heard Alexis Pitov’s voice.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I’m here. What time is it?” he asked, and then added, “I fell asleep. I was dreaming.”</p>
			<p>It was all right; he was going to be able to remember. He could still see the slim woman with the graying blonde hair, playing with the little dachshund among the new-fallen leaves on the lawn. He was glad they’d both been in this dream together; these dream-glimpses were all he’d had for the last fifteen years, and they were too precious to lose. He opened his eyes. The Russian was sitting just outside the light from the open door of the bungalow, lighting a cigarette. For a moment, he could see the blocky, high-cheeked face, now pouched and wrinkled, and then the flame went out and there was only the red coal glowing in the darkness. He closed his eyes again, and the dream picture came back to him, the woman catching the little dog and raising her head as though to speak to him.</p>
			<p>“Plenty of time, yet.” Pitov was speaking German instead of Spanish, as they always did between themselves. “They’re still counting down from minus three hours. I just phoned the launching site for a jeep. Eugenio’s been there ever since dinner; they say he’s running around like a cat looking for a place to have her first litter of kittens.”</p>
			<p>He chuckled. This would be something new for Eugenio Galvez⁠—for which he could be thankful.</p>
			<p>“I hope the generators don’t develop any last-second bugs,” he said. “We’ll only be a mile and a half away, and that’ll be too close to fifty kilos of negamatter if the field collapses.”</p>
			<p>“It’ll be all right,” Pitov assured him. “The bugs have all been chased out years ago.”</p>
			<p>“Not out of those generators in the rocket. They’re new.” He fumbled in his coat pocket for his pipe and tobacco. “I never thought I’d run another nuclear-bomb test, as long as I lived.”</p>
			<p>“Lee!” Pitov was shocked. “You mustn’t call it that. It isn’t that, at all. It’s purely a scientific experiment.”</p>
			<p>“Wasn’t that all any of them were? We made lots of experiments like this, back before 1969.” The memories of all those other tests, each ending in an Everest-high mushroom column, rose in his mind. And the end result⁠—the United States and the Soviet Union blasted to rubble, a whole hemisphere pushed back into the Dark Ages, a quarter of a billion dead. Including a slim woman with graying blonde hair, and a little red dog, and a girl from Odessa whom Alexis Pitov had been going to marry. “Forgive me, Alexis. I just couldn’t help remembering. I suppose it’s this shot we’re going to make, tonight. It’s so much like the other ones, before⁠—” He hesitated slightly. “Before the Auburn Bomb.”</p>
			<p>There; he’d come out and said it. In all the years they’d worked together at the <i xml:lang="es">Instituto Argentino de Ciencia Fisica</i>, that had been unmentioned between them. The families of hanged cutthroats avoid mention of ropes and knives. He thumbed the old-fashioned American lighter and held it to his pipe. Across the veranda, in the darkness, he knew that Pitov was looking intently at him.</p>
			<p>“You’ve been thinking about that, lately, haven’t you?” the Russian asked, and then, timidly: “Was that what you were dreaming of?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, no, thank heaven!”</p>
			<p>“I think about it, too, always. I suppose⁠—” He seemed relieved, now that it had been brought out into the open and could be discussed. “You saw it fall, didn’t you?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. From about thirty miles away. A little closer than we’ll be to this shot, tonight. I was in charge of the investigation at Auburn, until we had New York and Washington and Detroit and Mobile and San Francisco to worry about. Then what had happened to Auburn wasn’t important, any more. We were trying to get evidence to lay before the United Nations. We kept at it for about twelve hours after the United Nations had ceased to exist.”</p>
			<p>“I could never understand about that, Lee. I don’t know what the truth is; I probably never shall. But I know that my government did not launch that missile. During the first days after yours began coming in, I talked to people who had been in the Kremlin at the time. One had been in the presence of Klyzenko himself when the news of your bombardment arrived. He said that Klyzenko was absolutely stunned. We always believed that your government decided upon a preventive surprise attack, and picked out a town, Auburn, New York, that had been hit by one of our first retaliation missiles, and claimed that it had been hit first.”</p>
			<p>He shook his head. “Auburn was hit an hour before the first American missile was launched. I know that to be a fact. We could never understand why you launched just that one, and no more until after ours began landing on you; why you threw away the advantage of surprise and priority of attack⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Because we didn’t do it, Lee!” The Russian’s voice trembled with earnestness. “You believe me when I tell you that?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I believe you. After all that happened, and all that you, and I, and the people you worked with, and the people I worked with, and your government, and mine, have been guilty of, it would be a waste of breath for either of us to try to lie to the other about what happened fifteen years ago.” He drew slowly on his pipe. “But who launched it, then? It had to be launched by somebody.”</p>
			<p>“Don’t you think I’ve been tormenting myself with that question for the last fifteen years?” Pitov demanded. “You know, there were people inside the Soviet Union⁠—not many, and they kept themselves well hidden⁠—who were dedicated to the overthrow of the Soviet regime. They, or some of them, might have thought that the devastation of both our countries, and the obliteration of civilization in the Northern Hemisphere, would be a cheap price to pay for ending the rule of the Communist Party.”</p>
			<p>“Could they have built an <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.C.B.M.</abbr> with a thermonuclear warhead in secret?” he asked. “There were also fanatical nationalist groups in Europe, both sides of the Iron Curtain, who might have thought our mutual destruction would be worth the risks involved.”</p>
			<p>“There was China, and India. If your country and mine wiped each other out, they could go back to the old ways and the old traditions. Or Japan, or the Moslem States. In the end, they all went down along with us, but what criminal ever expects to fall?”</p>
			<p>“We have too many suspects, and the trail’s too cold, Alexis. That rocket wouldn’t have had to have been launched anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere. For instance, our friends here in the Argentine have been doing very well by themselves since <i xml:lang="es">El Coloso del Norte</i> went down.”</p>
			<p>And there were the Australians, picking themselves up bargains in real-estate in the East Indies at gun-point, and there were the Boers, trekking north again, in tanks instead of ox-wagons. And Brazil, with a not-too-implausible pretender to the Braganza throne, calling itself the Portuguese Empire and looking eastward. And, to complete the picture, here were Professor Doctor Lee Richardson and Comrade Professor Alexis Petrovitch Pitov, getting ready to test a missile with a matter-annihilation warhead.</p>
			<p>No. This thing just wasn’t a weapon.</p>
			<p>A jeep came around the corner, lighting the dark roadway between the bungalows, its radio on and counting down⁠—<em>Twenty two minutes. Twenty one fifty nine, fifty eight, fifty seven</em>⁠—It came to a stop in front of their bungalow, at exactly Minus Two Hours, Twenty One Minutes, Fifty Four Seconds. The driver called out in Spanish:</p>
			<p>“Doctor Richardson; Doctor Pitov! Are you ready?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, ready. We’re coming.”</p>
			<p>They both got to their feet, Richardson pulling himself up reluctantly. The older you get, the harder it is to leave a comfortable chair. He settled himself beside his colleague and former enemy, and the jeep started again, rolling between the buildings of the living-quarters area and out onto the long, straight road across the pampas toward the distant blaze of electric lights.</p>
			<p>He wondered why he had been thinking so much, lately, about the Auburn Bomb. He’d questioned, at times, indignantly, of course, whether Russia had launched it⁠—but it wasn’t until tonight, until he had heard what Pitov had had to say, that he seriously doubted it. Pitov wouldn’t lie about it, and Pitov would have been in a position to have known the truth, if the missile had been launched from Russia. Then he stopped thinking about what was water⁠—or blood⁠—a long time over the dam.</p>
			<p>The special policeman at the entrance to the launching site reminded them that they were both smoking; when they extinguished, respectively, their cigarette and pipe, he waved the jeep on and went back to his argument with a carload of tourists who wanted to get a good view of the launching.</p>
			<p>“There, now, Lee; do you need anything else to convince you that this isn’t a weapon project?” Pitov asked.</p>
			<p>“No, now that you mention it. I don’t. You know, I don’t believe I’ve had to show an identity card the whole time I’ve been here.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t believe I have an identity card,” Pitov said. “Think of that.”</p>
			<p>The lights blazed everywhere around them, but mostly about the rocket that towered above everything else, so thick that it seemed squat. The gantry-cranes had been hauled away, now, and it stood alone, but it was still wreathed in thick electric cables. They were pouring enough current into that thing to light half the street-lights in Buenos Aires; when the cables were blown free by separation charges at the blastoff, the generators powered by the rocket-engines had better be able to take over, because if the magnetic field collapsed and that fifty-kilo chunk of negative-proton matter came in contact with natural positive-proton matter, an old-fashioned <abbr>H</abbr>-bomb would be a firecracker to what would happen. Just one hundred kilos of pure, two-hundred proof MC<sup>2</sup>.</p>
			<p>The driver took them around the rocket, dodging assorted trucks and mobile machinery that were being hurried out of the way. The countdown was just beyond two hours five minutes. The jeep stopped at the edge of a crowd around three more trucks, and Doctor Eugenio Galvez, the director of the Institute, left the crowd and approached at an awkward half-run as they got down.</p>
			<p>“Is everything checked, gentlemen?” he wanted to know.</p>
			<p>“It was this afternoon at 1730,” Pitov told him. “And nobody’s been burning my telephone to report anything different. Are the balloons and the drone planes ready?”</p>
			<p>“The Air Force just finished checking; they’re ready. Captain Urquiola flew one of the planes over the course and made a guidance-tape; that’s been duplicated and all the planes are equipped with copies.”</p>
			<p>“How’s the wind?” Richardson asked.</p>
			<p>“Still steady. We won’t have any trouble about fallout or with the balloons.”</p>
			<p>“Then we’d better go back to the bunker and make sure everybody there is on the job.”</p>
			<p>The loudspeaker was counting down to Two Hours One Minute.</p>
			<p>“Could you spare a few minutes to talk to the press?” Eugenio Galvez asked. “And perhaps say a few words for telecast? This last is most important; we can’t explain too many times the purpose of this experiment. There is still much hostility, arising from fear that we are testing a nuclear weapon.”</p>
			<p>The press and telecast services were well represented; there were close to a hundred correspondents, from all over South America, from South Africa and Australia, even one from Ceylon. They had three trucks, with mobile telecast pickups, and when they saw who was approaching, they released the two rocketry experts they had been quizzing and pounced on the new victims.</p>
			<p>Was there any possibility that negative-proton matter might be used as a weapon?</p>
			<p>“Anything can be used as a weapon; you could stab a man to death with that lead pencil you’re using,” Pitov replied. “But I doubt if negamatter will ever be so used. We’re certainly not working on weapons design here. We started, six years ago, with the ability to produce negative protons, reverse-spin neutrons, and positrons, and the theoretical possibility of assembling them into negamatter. We have just gotten a fifty kilogramme mass of nega-iron assembled. In those six years, we had to invent all our techniques, and design all our equipment. If we’d been insane enough to want to build a nuclear weapon, after what we went through up North, we could have done so from memory, and designed a better⁠—which is to say a worse⁠—one from memory in a few days.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, and building a negamatter bomb for military purposes would be like digging a fifty foot shaft to get a rock to bash somebody’s head in, when you could do the job better with the shovel you’re digging with,” Richardson added. “The time, money, energy and work we put in on this thing would be ample to construct twenty thermonuclear bombs. And that’s only a small part of it.” He went on to tell them about the magnetic bottle inside the rocket’s warhead, mentioning how much electric current was needed to keep up the magnetic field that insulated the negamatter from contact with posimatter.</p>
			<p>“Then what was the purpose of this experiment, Doctor Richardson?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, we were just trying to find out a few basic facts about natural structure. Long ago, it was realized that the nucleonic particles⁠—protons, neutrons, mesons and so on⁠—must have structure of their own. Since we started constructing negative-proton matter, we’ve found out a few things about nucleonic structure. Some rather odd things, including fractions of Planck’s constant.”</p>
			<p>A couple of the correspondents⁠—a man from La Prensa, and an Australian⁠—whistled softly. The others looked blank. Pitov took over:</p>
			<p>“You see, gentlemen, most of what we learned, we learned from putting negamatter atoms together. We annihilated a few of them⁠—over there in that little concrete building, we have one of the most massive steel vaults in the world, where we do that⁠—but we assembled millions of them for every one we annihilated, and that chunk of nega-iron inside the magnetic bottle kept growing. And when you have a piece of negamatter you don’t want, you can’t just throw it out on the scrap-pile. We might have rocketed it into escape velocity and let it blow up in space, away from the Moon or any of the artificial satellites, but why waste it? So we’re going to have the rocket eject it, and when it falls, we can see, by our telemetered instruments, just what happens.”</p>
			<p>“Well, won’t it be annihilated by contact with atmosphere?” somebody asked.</p>
			<p>“That’s one of the things we want to find out,” Pitov said. “We estimate about twenty percent loss from contact with atmosphere, but the mass that actually lands on the target area should be about forty kilos. It should be something of a spectacle, coming down.”</p>
			<p>“You say you had to assemble it, after creating the negative protons and neutrons and the positrons. Doesn’t any of this sort of matter exist in nature?”</p>
			<p>The man who asked that knew better himself. He just wanted the answer on the record.</p>
			<p>“Oh no; not on this planet, and probably not in the Galaxy. There may be whole galaxies composed of nothing but negamatter. There may even be isolated stars and planetary systems inside our Galaxy composed of negamatter, though I think that very improbable. But when negamatter and posimatter come into contact with one another, the result is immediate mutual annihilation.”</p>
			<p>They managed to get away from the press, and returned as far as the bunkers, a mile and a half away. Before they went inside, Richardson glanced up at the sky, fixing the location of a few of the more conspicuous stars in his mind. There were almost a hundred men and women inside, each at his or her instruments⁠—viewscreens, radar indicators, detection instruments of a dozen kinds. The reporters and telecast people arrived shortly afterward, and Eugenio Galvez took them in tow. While Richardson and Pitov were making their last-minute rounds, the countdown progressed past minus one hour, and at minus twenty minutes all the overhead lights went off and the small instrument operators’ lights came on.</p>
			<p>Pitov turned on a couple of viewscreens, one from a pickup on the roof of the bunker and another from the launching-pad. They sat down side by side and waited. Richardson got his pipe out and began loading it. The loudspeaker was saying: “<em>Minus two minutes, one fifty nine, fifty eight, fifty seven</em>⁠—”</p>
			<p>He let his mind drift away from the test, back to the world that had been smashed around his ears in the autumn of 1969. He was doing that so often, now, when he should be thinking about⁠—</p>
			<p>“<em>Two seconds, one second. <strong>Firing!</strong></em>”</p>
			<p>It was a second later that his eyes focussed on the left hand viewscreen. Red and yellow flames were gushing out at the bottom of the rocket, and it was beginning to tremble. Then the upper jets, the ones that furnished power for the generators, began firing. He looked anxiously at the meters; the generators were building up power. Finally, when he was sure that the rocket would be blasting off anyhow, the separator-charges fired and the heavy cables fell away. An instant later, the big missile started inching upward, gaining speed by the second, first slowly and jerkily and then more rapidly, until it passed out of the field of the pickup. He watched the rising spout of fire from the other screen until it passed from sight.</p>
			<p>By that time, Pitov had twisted a dial and gotten another view on the left hand screen, this time from close to the target. That camera was radar-controlled; it had fastened onto the approaching missile, which was still invisible. The stars swung slowly across the screen until Richardson recognized the ones he had spotted at the zenith. In a moment, now, the rocket, a hundred miles overhead, would be nosing down, and then the warhead would open and the magnetic field inside would alter and the mass of negamatter would be ejected.</p>
			<p>The stars were blotted out by a sudden glow of light. Even at a hundred miles, there was enough atmospheric density to produce considerable energy release. Pitov, beside him, was muttering, partly in German and partly in Russian; most of what Richardson caught was figures. Trying to calculate how much of the mass of unnatural iron would get down for the ground blast. Then the right hand screen broke into a wriggling orgy of color, and at the same time every scrap of radio-transmitted apparatus either went out or began reporting erratically. The left hand screen, connected by wiring to the pickup on the roof, was still functioning. For a moment, Richardson wondered what was going on, and then shocked recognition drove that from his mind as he stared at the ever-brightening glare in the sky.</p>
			<p>It was the Auburn Bomb again! He was back, in memory, to the night on the shore of Lake Ontario; the party breaking up in the early hours of morning; he and Janet and the people with whom they had been spending a vacation week standing on the lawn as the guests were getting into their cars. And then the sudden light in the sky. The cries of surprise, and then of alarm as it seemed to be rushing straight down upon them. He and Janet, clutching each other and staring up in terror at the falling blaze from which there seemed no escape. Then relief, as it curved away from them and fell to the south. And then the explosion, lighting the whole southern sky.</p>
			<p>There was a similar explosion in the screen, when the mass of nega-iron landed⁠—a sheet of pure white light, so bright and so quick as to almost pass above the limit of visibility, and then a moment’s darkness that was in his stunned eyes more than in the screen, and then the rising glow of updrawn incandescent dust.</p>
			<p>Before the sound-waves had reached them, he had been legging it into the house. The television had been on, and it had been acting as insanely as the screen on his right now. He had called the State Police⁠—the telephones had been working all right⁠—and told them who he was, and they had told him to stay put and they’d send a car for him. They did, within minutes. Janet and his host and hostess had waited with him on the lawn until it came, and after he had gotten into it, he had turned around and looked back through the rear window, and seen Janet standing under the front light, holding the little dog in her arms, flopping one of its silly little paws up and down with her hand to wave goodbye to him.</p>
			<p>He had seen her and the dog like that every day of his life for the last fifteen years.</p>
			<p>“What kind of radiation are you getting?” he could hear Alexis Pitov asking into a phone. “What? Nothing else? Oh; yes, of course. But mostly cosmic. That shouldn’t last long.” He turned from the phone. “A devil’s own dose of cosmic, and some gamma. It was the cosmic radiation that put the radios and telescreens out. That’s why I insisted that the drone planes be independent of radio control.”</p>
			<p>They always got cosmic radiation from the micro-annihilations in the test-vault. Well, now they had an idea of what produced natural cosmic rays. There must be quite a bit of negamatter and posimatter going into mutual annihilation and total energy release through the Universe.</p>
			<p>“Of course, there were no detectors set up in advance around Auburn,” he said. “We didn’t really begin to find anything out for half an hour. By that time, the cosmic radiation was over and we weren’t getting anything but gamma.”</p>
			<p>“What⁠—What has Auburn to do⁠—?” The Russian stopped short. “You think this was the same thing?” He gave it a moment’s consideration. “Lee, you’re crazy! There wasn’t an atom of artificial negamatter in the world in 1969. Nobody had made any before us. We gave each other some scientific surprises, then, but nobody surprised both of us. You and I, between us, knew everything that was going on in nuclear physics in the world. And you know as well as I do⁠—”</p>
			<p>A voice came out of the public-address speaker. “Some of the radio equipment around the target area, that wasn’t knocked out by blast, is beginning to function again. There is an increasingly heavy gamma radiation, but no more cosmic rays. They were all prompt radiation from the annihilation; the gamma is secondary effect. Wait a moment; Captain Urquiola, of the Air Force, says that the first drone plane is about to take off.”</p>
			<p>It had been two hours after the blast that the first drones had gone over what had been Auburn, New York. He was trying to remember, as exactly as possible, what had been learned from them. Gamma radiation; a great deal of gamma. But it didn’t last long. It had been almost down to a safe level by the time the investigation had been called off, and, two months after there had been no more missiles, and no way of producing more, and no targets to send them against if they’d had them, rather⁠—he had been back at Auburn on his hopeless quest, and there had been almost no trace of radiation. Nothing but a wide, shallow crater, almost two hundred feet in diameter and only fifteen at its deepest, already full of water, and a circle of flattened and scattered rubble for a mile and a half all around it. He was willing to bet anything that that was what they’d find where the chunk of nega-iron had landed, fifty miles away on the pampas.</p>
			<p>Well, the first drone ought to be over the target area before long, and at least one of the balloons that had been sent up was reporting its course by radio. The radios in the others were silent, and the recording counters had probably jammed in all of them. There’d be something of interest when the first drone came back. He dragged his mind back to the present, and went to work with Alexis Pitov.</p>
			<p>They were at it all night, checking, evaluating, making sure that the masses of data that were coming in were being promptly processed for programming the computers. At each of the increasingly frequent coffee-breaks, he noticed Pitov looking curiously. He said nothing, however, until, long after dawn, they stood outside the bunker, waiting for the jeep that would take them back to their bungalow and watching the line of trucks⁠—Argentine army engineers, locally hired laborers, load after load of prefab-huts and equipment⁠—going down toward the target-area, where they would be working for the next week.</p>
			<p>“Lee, were you serious?” Pitov asked. “I mean, about this being like the one at Auburn?”</p>
			<p>“It was exactly like Auburn; even that blazing light that came rushing down out of the sky. I wondered about that at the time⁠—what kind of a missile would produce an effect like that. Now I know. We just launched one like it.”</p>
			<p>“But that’s impossible! I told you, between us we know everything that was happening in nuclear physics then. Nobody in the world knew how to assemble atoms of negamatter and build them into masses.”</p>
			<p>“Nobody, and nothing, on this planet built that mass of negamatter. I doubt if it even came from this Galaxy. But we didn’t know that, then. When that negamatter meteor fell, the only thing anybody could think of was that it had been a Soviet missile. If it had hit around Leningrad or Moscow or Kharkov, who would you have blamed it on?”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Edge of the Knife</h2>
			<p>Chalmers stopped talking abruptly, warned by the sudden attentiveness of the class in front of him. They were all staring; even Guellick, in the fourth row, was almost half awake. Then one of them, taking his silence as an invitation to questions found his voice.</p>
			<p>“You say Khalid ib’n Hussein’s been assassinated?” he asked incredulously. “When did that happen?”</p>
			<p>“In 1973, at Basra.” There was a touch of impatience in his voice; surely they ought to know that much. “He was shot, while leaving the Parliament Building, by an Egyptian Arab named Mohammed Noureed, with an old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.</abbr> Army M3 submachine-gun. Noureed killed two of Khalid’s guards and wounded another before he was overpowered. He was lynched on the spot by the crowd; stoned to death. Ostensibly, he and his accomplices were religious fanatics; however, there can be no doubt whatever that the murder was inspired, at least indirectly, by the Eastern Axis.”</p>
			<p>The class stirred like a grainfield in the wind. Some looked at him in blank amazement; some were hastily averting faces red with poorly suppressed laughter. For a moment he was puzzled, and then realization hit him like a blow in the stomach-pit. He’d forgotten, again.</p>
			<p>“I didn’t see anything in the papers about it,” one boy was saying.</p>
			<p>“The newscast, last evening, said Khalid was in Ankara, talking to the President of Turkey,” another offered.</p>
			<p>“Professor Chalmers, would you tell us just what effect Khalid’s death had upon the Islamic Caliphate and the Middle Eastern situation in general?” a third voice asked with exaggerated solemnity. That was Kendrick, the class humorist; the question was pure baiting.</p>
			<p>“Well, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Kendrick, I’m afraid it’s a little too early to assess the full results of a thing like that, if they can ever be fully assessed. For instance, who, in 1911, could have predicted all the consequences of the pistol-shot at Sarajevo? Who, even today, can guess what the history of the world would have been had Zangarra not missed Franklin Roosevelt in 1932? There’s always that if.”</p>
			<p>He went on talking safe generalities as he glanced covertly at his watch. Only five minutes to the end of the period; thank heaven he hadn’t made that slip at the beginning of the class. “For instance, tomorrow, when we take up the events in India from the First World War to the end of British rule, we will be largely concerned with another victim of the assassin’s bullet, Mohandas K. Gandhi. You may ask yourselves, then, by how much that bullet altered the history of the Indian subcontinent. A word of warning, however: The events we will be discussing will be either contemporary with or prior to what was discussed today. I hope that you’re all keeping your notes properly dated. It’s always easy to become confused in matters of chronology.”</p>
			<p>He wished, too late, that he hadn’t said that. It pointed up the very thing he was trying to play down, and raised a general laugh.</p>
			<p>As soon as the room was empty, he hastened to his desk, snatched pencil and notepad. This had been a bad one, the worst yet; he hadn’t heard the end of it by any means. He couldn’t waste thought on that now, though. This was all new and important; it had welled up suddenly and without warning into his conscious mind, and he must get it down in notes before the “memory”⁠—even mentally, he always put that word into quotes⁠—was lost. He was still scribbling furiously when the instructor who would use the room for the next period entered, followed by a few of his students. Chalmers finished, crammed the notes into his pocket, and went out into the hall.</p>
			<p>Most of his own Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> class had left the building and were on their way across the campus for science classes. A few, however, were joining groups for other classes here in Prescott Hall, and in every group, they were the center of interest. Sometimes, when they saw him, they would fall silent until he had passed; sometimes they didn’t, and he caught snatches of conversation.</p>
			<p>“Oh, brother! Did Chalmers really blow his jets this time!” one voice was saying.</p>
			<p>“Bet he won’t be around next year.”</p>
			<p>Another quartet, with their heads together, were talking more seriously.</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m not majoring in History, myself, but I think it’s an outrage that some people’s diplomas are going to depend on grades given by a lunatic!”</p>
			<p>“Mine will, and I’m not going to stand for it. My old man’s president of the Alumni Association, and.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>That was something he had not thought of, before. It gave him an ugly start. He was still thinking about it as he turned into the side hall to the History Department offices and entered the cubicle he shared with a colleague. The colleague, old Pottgeiter, Medieval History, was emerging in a rush; short, rotund, gray-bearded, his arms full of books and papers, oblivious, as usual, to anything that had happened since the Battle of Bosworth or the Fall of Constantinople. Chalmers stepped quickly out of his way and entered behind him. Marjorie Fenner, the secretary they also shared, was tidying up the old man’s desk.</p>
			<p>“Good morning, Doctor Chalmers.” She looked at him keenly for a moment. “They give you a bad time again in Modern Four?”</p>
			<p>Good Lord, did he show it that plainly? In any case, it was no use trying to kid Marjorie. She’d hear the whole story before the end of the day.</p>
			<p>“Gave myself a bad time.”</p>
			<p>Marjorie, still fussing with Pottgeiter’s desk, was about to say something in reply. Instead, she exclaimed in exasperation.</p>
			<p>“Ohhh! That man! He’s forgotten his notes again!” She gathered some papers from Pottgeiter’s desk, rushing across the room and out the door with them.</p>
			<p>For a while, he sat motionless, the books and notes for General European History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> untouched in front of him. This was going to raise hell. It hadn’t been the first slip he’d made, either; that thought kept recurring to him. There had been the time when he had alluded to the colonies on Mars and Venus. There had been the time he’d mentioned the secession of Canada from the British Commonwealth, and the time he’d called the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> the Terran Federation. And the time he’d tried to get a copy of Franchard’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rise and Decline of the System States</i>, which wouldn’t be published until the Twenty-eighth Century, out of the college library. None of those had drawn much comment, beyond a few student jokes about the history professor who lived in the future instead of the past. Now, however, they’d all be remembered, raked up, exaggerated, and added to what had happened this morning.</p>
			<p>He sighed and sat down at Marjorie’s typewriter and began transcribing his notes. Assassination of Khalid ib’n Hussein, the pro-Western leader of the newly formed Islamic Caliphate; period of anarchy in the Middle East; interfactional power-struggles; Turkish intervention. He wondered how long that would last; Khalid’s son, Tallal ib’n Khalid, was at school in England when his father was⁠—would be⁠—killed. He would return, and eventually take his father’s place, in time to bring the Caliphate into the Terran Federation when the general war came. There were some notes on that already; the war would result from an attempt by the Indian Communists to seize East Pakistan. The trouble was that he so seldom “remembered” an exact date. His “memory” of the year of Khalid’s assassination was an exception.</p>
			<p>Nineteen seventy-three⁠—why, that was this year. He looked at the calendar. <time datetime="1973-10-16">October 16, 1973</time>. At very most, the Arab statesman had two and a half months to live. Would there be any possible way in which he could give a credible warning? He doubted it. Even if there were, he questioned whether he should⁠—for that matter, whether he <em>could</em>⁠—interfere.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He always lunched at the Faculty Club; today was no time to call attention to himself by breaking an established routine. As he entered, trying to avoid either a furtive slink or a chip-on-shoulder swagger, the crowd in the lobby stopped talking abruptly, then began again on an obviously changed subject. The word had gotten around, apparently. Handley, the head of the Latin Department, greeted him with a distantly polite nod. Pompous old owl; regarded himself, for some reason, as a sort of unofficial Dean of the Faculty. Probably didn’t want to be seen fraternizing with controversial characters. One of the younger men, with a thin face and a mop of unruly hair, advanced to meet him as he came in, as cordial as Handley was remote.</p>
			<p>“Oh, hello, Ed!” he greeted, clapping a hand on Chalmers’ shoulder. “I was hoping I’d run into you. Can you have dinner with us this evening?” He was sincere.</p>
			<p>“Well, thanks, Leonard. I’d like to, but I have a lot of work. Could you give me a rain-check?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, surely. My wife was wishing you’d come around, but I know how it is. Some other evening?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, indeed.” He guided Fitch toward the dining-room door and nodded toward a table. “This doesn’t look too crowded; let’s sit here.”</p>
			<p>After lunch, he stopped in at his office. Marjorie Fenner was there, taking dictation from Pottgeiter; she nodded to him as he entered, but she had no summons to the president’s office.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The summons was waiting for him, the next morning, when he entered the office after Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, a few minutes past ten.</p>
			<p>“Doctor Whitburn just phoned,” Marjorie said. “He’d like to see you, as soon as you have a vacant period.”</p>
			<p>“Which means right away. I shan’t keep him waiting.”</p>
			<p>She started to say something, swallowed it, and then asked if he needed anything typed up for General European <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>.</p>
			<p>“No, I have everything ready.” He pocketed the pipe he had filled on entering, and went out.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The president of Blanley College sat hunched forward at his desk; he had rounded shoulders and round, pudgy fists and a round, bald head. He seemed to be expecting his visitor to stand at attention in front of him. Chalmers got the pipe out of his pocket, sat down in the deskside chair, and snapped his lighter.</p>
			<p>“Good morning, Doctor Whitburn,” he said very pleasantly.</p>
			<p>Whitburn’s scowl deepened. “I hope I don’t have to tell you why I wanted to see you,” he began.</p>
			<p>“I have an idea.” Chalmers puffed until the pipe was drawing satisfactorily. “It might help you get started if you did, though.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t suppose, at that, that you realize the full effect of your performance, yesterday morning, in Modern History Four,” Whitburn replied. “I don’t suppose you know, for instance, that I had to intervene at the last moment and suppress an editorial in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Black and Green</i>, derisively critical of you and your teaching methods, and, by implication, of the administration of this college. You didn’t hear about that, did you? No, living as you do in the future, you wouldn’t.”</p>
			<p>“If the students who edit the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Black and Green</i> are dissatisfied with anything here, I’d imagine they ought to say so,” Chalmers commented. “Isn’t that what they teach in the journalism classes, that the purpose of journalism is to speak for the dissatisfied? Why make exception?”</p>
			<p>“I should think you’d be grateful to me for trying to keep your behavior from being made a subject of public ridicule among your students. Why, this editorial which I suppressed actually went so far as to question your sanity!”</p>
			<p>“I should suppose it might have sounded a good deal like that, to them. Of course, I have been preoccupied, lately, with an imaginative projection of present trends into the future. I’ll quite freely admit that I should have kept my extracurricular work separate from my class and lecture work, but.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“That’s no excuse, even if I were sure it were true! What you did, while engaged in the serious teaching of history, was to indulge in a farrago of nonsense, obvious as such to any child, and damage not only your own standing with your class but the standing of Blanley College as well. Doctor Chalmers, if this were the first incident of the kind it would be bad enough, but it isn’t. You’ve done things like this before, and I’ve warned you before. I assumed, then, that you were merely showing the effects of overwork, and I offered you a vacation, which you refused to take. Well, this is the limit. I’m compelled to request your immediate resignation.”</p>
			<p>Chalmers laughed. “A moment ago, you accused me of living in the future. It seems you’re living in the past. Evidently you haven’t heard about the Higher Education Faculty Tenure Act of 1963, or such things as tenure-contracts. Well, for your information, I have one; you signed it yourself, in case you’ve forgotten. If you want my resignation, you’ll have to show cause, in a court of law, why my contract should be voided, and I don’t think a slip of the tongue is a reason for voiding a contract that any court would accept.”</p>
			<p>Whitburn’s face reddened. “You don’t, don’t you? Well, maybe it isn’t, but insanity is. It’s a very good reason for voiding a contract voidable on grounds of unfitness or incapacity to teach.”</p>
			<p>He had been expecting, and mentally shrinking from, just that. Now that it was out, however, he felt relieved. He gave another short laugh.</p>
			<p>“You’re willing to go into open court, covered by reporters from papers you can’t control as you do this student sheet here, and testify that for the past twelve years you’ve had an insane professor on your faculty?”</p>
			<p>“You’re.⁠ ⁠… You’re trying to blackmail me?” Whitburn demanded, half rising.</p>
			<p>“It isn’t blackmail to tell a man that a bomb he’s going to throw will blow up in his hand.” Chalmers glanced quickly at his watch. “Now, Doctor Whitburn, if you have nothing further to discuss, I have a class in a few minutes. If you’ll excuse me.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>He rose. For a moment, he stood facing Whitburn; when the college president said nothing, he inclined his head politely and turned, going out.</p>
			<p>Whitburn’s secretary gave the impression of having seated herself hastily at her desk the second before he opened the door. She watched him, round-eyed, as he went out into the hall.</p>
			<p>He reached his own office ten minutes before time for the next class. Marjorie was typing something for Pottgeiter; he merely nodded to her, and picked up the phone. The call would have to go through the school exchange, and he had a suspicion that Whitburn kept a check on outside calls. That might not hurt any, he thought, dialing a number.</p>
			<p>“Attorney Weill’s office,” the girl who answered said.</p>
			<p>“Edward Chalmers. Is <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Weill in?”</p>
			<p>She’d find out. He was; he answered in a few seconds.</p>
			<p>“Hello, Stanly; Ed Chalmers. I think I’m going to need a little help. I’m having some trouble with President Whitburn, here at the college. A matter involving the validity of my tenure-contract. I don’t want to go into it over this line. Have you anything on for lunch?”</p>
			<p>“No, I haven’t. When and where?” the lawyer asked.</p>
			<p>He thought for a moment. Nowhere too close the campus, but not too far away.</p>
			<p>“How about the Continental; Fontainbleu Room? Say twelve-fifteen.”</p>
			<p>“That’ll be all right. Be seeing you.”</p>
			<p>Marjorie looked at him curiously as he gathered up the things he needed for the next class.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Stanly Weill had a thin dark-eyed face. He was frowning as he set down his coffee-cup.</p>
			<p>“Ed, you ought to know better than to try to kid your lawyer,” he said. “You say Whitburn’s trying to force you to resign. With your contract, he can’t do that, not without good and sufficient cause, and under the Faculty Tenure Law, that means something just an inch short of murder in the first degree. Now, what’s Whitburn got on you?”</p>
			<p>Beat around the bush and try to build a background, or come out with it at once and fill in the details afterward? He debated mentally for a moment, then decided upon the latter course.</p>
			<p>“Well, it happens that I have the ability to prehend future events. I can, by concentrating, bring into my mind the history of the world, at least in general outline, for the next five thousand years. Whitburn thinks I’m crazy, mainly because I get confused at times and forget that something I know about hasn’t happened yet.”</p>
			<p>Weill snatched the cigarette from his mouth to keep from swallowing it. As it was, he choked on a mouthful of smoke and coughed violently, then sat back in the booth-seat, staring speechlessly.</p>
			<p>“It started a little over three years ago,” Chalmers continued. “Just after New Year’s, 1970. I was getting up a series of seminars for some of my postgraduate students on extrapolation of present social and political trends to the middle of the next century, and I began to find that I was getting some very fixed and definite ideas of what the world of 2050 to 2070 would be like. Completely unified world, abolition of all national states under a single world sovereignty, colonies on Mars and Venus, that sort of thing. Some of these ideas didn’t seem quite logical; a number of them were complete reversals of present trends, and a lot seemed to depend on arbitrary and unpredictable factors. Mind, this was before the first rocket landed on the Moon, when the whole moon-rocket and lunar-base project was a triple-top secret. But I knew, in the spring of 1970, that the first unmanned rocket would be called the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kilroy</i>, and that it would be launched some time in 1971. You remember, when the news was released, it was stated that the rocket hadn’t been christened until the day before it was launched, when somebody remembered that old ‘Kilroy-was-here’ thing from the Second World War. Well, I knew about it over a year in advance.”</p>
			<p>Weill had been listening in silence. He had a naturally skeptical face; his present expression mightn’t really mean that he didn’t believe what he was hearing.</p>
			<p>“How’d you get all this stuff? In dreams?”</p>
			<p>Chalmers shook his head. “It just came to me. I’d be sitting reading, or eating dinner, or talking to one of my classes, and the first thing I’d know, something out of the future would come bubbling up in me. It just kept pushing up into my conscious mind. I wouldn’t have an idea of something one minute, and the next it would just be part of my general historical knowledge; I’d know it as positively as I know that Columbus discovered America in 1492. The only difference is that I can usually remember where I’ve read something in past history, but my future history I know without knowing how I know it.”</p>
			<p>“Ah, that’s the question!” Weill pounced. “You don’t know how you know it. Look, Ed, we’ve both studied psychology, elementary psychology at least. Anybody who has to work with people, these days, has to know some psychology. What makes you sure that these prophetic impressions of yours aren’t manufactured in your own subconscious mind?”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I thought, at first. I thought my subconscious was just building up this stuff to fill the gaps in what I’d produced from logical extrapolation. I’ve always been a stickler for detail,” he added, parenthetically. “It would be natural for me to supply details for the future. But, as I said, a lot of this stuff is based on unpredictable and arbitrary factors that can’t be inferred from anything in the present. That left me with the alternatives of delusion or precognition, and if I ever came near going crazy, it was before the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kilroy</i> landed and the news was released. After that, I knew which it was.”</p>
			<p>“And yet, you can’t explain how you can have real knowledge of a thing before it happens. Before it exists,” Weill said.</p>
			<p>“I really don’t need to. I’m satisfied with knowing that I know. But if you want me to furnish a theory, let’s say that all these things really do exist, in the past or in the future, and that the present is just a moving knife-edge that separates the two. You can’t even indicate the present. By the time you make up your mind to say, ‘Now!’ and transmit the impulse to your vocal organs, and utter the word, the original present moment is part of the past. The knife-edge has gone over it. Most people think they know only the present; what they know is the past, which they have already experienced, or read about. The difference with me is that I can see what’s on both sides of the knife-edge.”</p>
			<p>Weill put another cigarette in his mouth and bent his head to the flame of his lighter. For a moment, he sat motionless, his thin face rigid.</p>
			<p>“What do you want me to do?” he asked. “I’m a lawyer, not a psychiatrist.”</p>
			<p>“I want a lawyer. This is a legal matter. Whitburn’s talking about voiding my tenure contract. You helped draw it; I have a right to expect you to help defend it.”</p>
			<p>“Ed, have you been talking about this to anybody else?” Weill asked.</p>
			<p>“You’re the first person I’ve mentioned it to. It’s not the sort of thing you’d bring up casually, in a conversation.”</p>
			<p>“Then how’d Whitburn get hold of it?”</p>
			<p>“He didn’t, not the way I’ve given it to you. But I made a couple of slips, now and then. I made a bad one yesterday morning.”</p>
			<p>He told Weill about it, and about his session with the president of the college that morning. The lawyer nodded.</p>
			<p>“That was a bad one, but you handled Whitburn the right way,” Weill said. “What he’s most afraid of is publicity, getting the college mixed up in anything controversial, and above all, the reactions of the trustees and people like that. If Dacre or anybody else makes any trouble, he’ll do his best to cover for you. Not willingly, of course, but because he’ll know that that’s the only way he can cover for himself. I don’t think you’ll have any more trouble with him. If you can keep your own nose clean, that is. Can you do that?”</p>
			<p>“I believe so. Yesterday I got careless. I’ll not do that again.”</p>
			<p>“You’d better not.” Weill hesitated for a moment. “I said I was a lawyer, not a psychiatrist. I’m going to give you some psychiatrist’s advice, though. Forget this whole thing. You say you can bring these impressions into your conscious mind by concentrating?” He waited briefly; Chalmers nodded, and he continued: “Well, stop it. Stop trying to harbor this stuff. It’s dangerous, Ed. Stop playing around with it.”</p>
			<p>“You think I’m crazy, too?”</p>
			<p>Weill shook his head impatiently. “I didn’t say that. But I’ll say, now, that you’re losing your grip on reality. You are constructing a system of fantasies, and the first thing you know, they will become your reality, and the world around you will be unreal and illusory. And that’s a state of mental incompetence that I can recognize, as a lawyer.”</p>
			<p>“How about the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kilroy</i>?”</p>
			<p>Weill looked at him intently. “Ed, are you sure you did have that experience?” he asked. “I’m not trying to imply that you’re consciously lying to me about that. I am suggesting that you manufactured a memory of that incident in your subconscious mind, and are deluding yourself into thinking that you knew about it in advance. False memory is a fairly common thing, in cases like this. Even the little psychology I know, I’ve heard about that. There’s been talk about rockets to the Moon for years. You included something about that in your future-history fantasy, and then, after the event, you convinced yourself that you’d known all about it, including the impromptu christening of the rocket, all along.”</p>
			<p>A hot retort rose to his lips; he swallowed it hastily. Instead, he nodded amicably.</p>
			<p>“That’s a point worth thinking of. But right now, what I want to know is, will you represent me in case Whitburn does take this to court and does try to void my contract?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes; as you said, I have an obligation to defend the contracts I draw up. But you’ll have to avoid giving him any further reason for trying to void it. Don’t make any more of these slips. Watch what you say, in class or out of it. And above all, don’t talk about this to anybody. Don’t tell anybody that you can foresee the future, or even talk about future probabilities. Your business is with the past; stick to it.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The afternoon passed quietly enough. Word of his defiance of Whitburn had gotten around among the faculty⁠—Whitburn might have his secretary scared witless in his office, but not gossipless outside it⁠—though it hadn’t seemed to have leaked down to the students yet. Handley, the Latin professor, managed to waylay him in a hallway, a hallway Handley didn’t normally use.</p>
			<p>“The tenure-contract system under which we hold our positions here is one of our most valuable safeguards,” he said, after exchanging greetings. “It was only won after a struggle, in a time of public animosity toward all intellectuals, and even now, our professional position would be most insecure without it.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. I found that out today, if I hadn’t known it when I took part in the struggle you speak of.”</p>
			<p>“It should not be jeopardized,” Handley declared.</p>
			<p>“You think I’m jeopardizing it?”</p>
			<p>Handley frowned. He didn’t like being pushed out of the safety of generalization into specific cases.</p>
			<p>“Well, now that you make that point, yes. I do. If Doctor Whitburn tries to make an issue of⁠ ⁠… of what happened yesterday⁠ ⁠… and if the court decides against you, you can see the position all of us will be in.”</p>
			<p>“What do you think I should have done? Given him my resignation when he demanded it? We have our tenure-contracts, and the system was instituted to prevent just the sort of arbitrary action Whitburn tried to take with me today. If he wants to go to court, he’ll find that out.”</p>
			<p>“And if he wins, he’ll establish a precedent that will threaten the security of every college and university faculty member in the state. In any state where there’s a tenure law.”</p>
			<p>Leonard Fitch, the psychologist, took an opposite attitude. As Chalmers was leaving the college at the end of the afternoon, Fitch cut across the campus to intercept him.</p>
			<p>“I heard about the way you stood up to Whitburn this morning, Ed,” he said. “Glad you did it. I only wish I’d done something like that three years ago.⁠ ⁠… Think he’s going to give you any real trouble?”</p>
			<p>“I doubt it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, I’m on your side if he does. I won’t be the only one, either.”</p>
			<p>“Well, thank you, Leonard. It always helps to know that. I don’t think there’ll be any more trouble, though.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He dined alone at his apartment, and sat over his coffee, outlining his work for the next day. When both were finished, he dallied indecisively, Weill’s words echoing through his mind and raising doubts. It was possible that he had been manufacturing the whole thing in his subconscious mind. That was, at least, a more plausible theory than any he had constructed to explain an ability to produce real knowledge of the future. Of course, there was that business about the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kilroy</i>. That had been too close on too many points to be dismissed as coincidence. Then, again, Weill’s words came back to disquiet him. Had he really gotten that before the event, as he believed, or had he only imagined, later, that he had?</p>
			<p>There was one way to settle that. He rose quickly and went to the filing-cabinet where he kept his future-history notes and began pulling out envelopes. There was nothing about the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kilroy</i> in the Twentieth Century file, where it should be, although he examined each sheet of notes carefully. The possibility that his notes on that might have been filed out of place by mistake occurred to him; he looked in every other envelope. The notes, as far as they went, were all filed in order, and each one bore, beside the future date of occurrence, the date on which the knowledge⁠—or must he call it delusion?⁠—had come to him. But there was no note on the landing of the first unmanned rocket on Luna.</p>
			<p>He put the notes away and went back to his desk, rummaging through the drawers, and finding nothing. He searched everywhere in the apartment where a sheet of paper could have been mislaid, taking all his books, one by one, from the shelves and leafing through them, even books he knew he had not touched for more than three years. In the end, he sat down again at his desk, defeated. The note on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Kilroy</i> simply did not exist.</p>
			<p>Of course, that didn’t settle it, as finding the note would have. He remembered⁠—or believed he remembered⁠—having gotten that item of knowledge⁠—or delusion⁠—in 1970, shortly before the end of the school term. It hadn’t been until after the fall opening of school that he had begun making notes. He could have had the knowledge of the robot rocket in his mind then, and neglected putting it on paper.</p>
			<p>He undressed, put on his pajamas, poured himself a drink, and went to bed. Three hours later, still awake, he got up, and poured himself another, bigger, drink. Somehow, eventually, he fell asleep.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The next morning, he searched his desk and bookcase in the office at school. He had never kept a diary; now he was wishing that he had. That might have contained something that would be evidence, one way or the other. All day, he vacillated between conviction of the reality of his future knowledge and resolution to have no more to do with it. Once he decided to destroy all the notes he had made, and thought of making a special study of some facet of history, and writing another book, to occupy his mind.</p>
			<p>After lunch, he found that more data on the period immediately before the Thirty Days’ War was coming into his consciousness. He resolutely suppressed it, knowing as he did that it might never come to him again. That evening, too, he cooked dinner for himself at his apartment, and laid out his classwork for the next day. He’d better not stay in, that evening; too much temptation to settle himself by the living-room fire with his pipe and his notepad and indulge in the vice he had determined to renounce. After a little debate, he decided upon a movie; he put on again the suit he had taken off on coming home, and went out.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The picture, a random choice among the three shows in the neighborhood, was about Seventeenth Century buccaneers; exciting action and a soundtrack loud with shots and cutlass-clashing. He let himself be drawn into it completely, and, until it was finished, he was able to forget both the college and the history of the future. But, as he walked home, he was struck by the parallel between the buccaneers of the West Indies and the space-pirates in the days of the dissolution of the First Galactic Empire, in the Tenth Century of the Interstellar Era. He hadn’t been too clear on that period, and he found new data rising in his mind; he hurried his steps, almost running upstairs to his room. It was long after midnight before he had finished the notes he had begun on his return home.</p>
			<p>Well, that had been a mistake, but he wouldn’t make it again. He determined again to destroy his notes, and began casting about for a subject which would occupy his mind to the exclusion of the future. Not the Spanish Conquistadores; that was too much like the early period of interstellar expansion. He thought for a time of the Sepoy Mutiny, and then rejected it⁠—he could “remember” something much like that on one of the planets of the Beta Hydrae system, in the Fourth Century of the Atomic Era. There were so few things, in the history of the past, which did not have their counterparts in the future. That evening, too, he stayed at home, preparing for his various classes for the rest of the week and making copious notes on what he would talk about to each. He needed more whiskey to get to sleep that night.</p>
			<p>Whitburn gave him no more trouble, and if any of the trustees or influential alumni made any protest about what had happened in Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, he heard nothing about it. He managed to conduct his classes without further incidents, and spent his evenings trying, not always successfully, to avoid drifting into “memories” of the future.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He came into his office that morning tired and unrefreshed by the few hours’ sleep he had gotten the night before, edgy from the strain, of trying to adjust his mind to the world of Blanley College in mid-April of 1973. Pottgeiter hadn’t arrived yet, but Marjorie Fenner was waiting for him; a newspaper in her hand, almost bursting with excitement.</p>
			<p>“Here; have you seen it, Doctor Chalmers?” she asked as he entered.</p>
			<p>He shook his head. He ought to read the papers more, to keep track of the advancing knife-edge that divided what he might talk about from what he wasn’t supposed to know, but each morning he seemed to have less and less time to get ready for work.</p>
			<p>“Well, look! Look at that!”</p>
			<p>She thrust the paper into his hands, still folded, the big, black headline where he could see it.</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>
					<b>Khalid Ib’n Hussein Assassinated</b>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He glanced over the leading paragraphs. Leader of Islamic Caliphate shot to death in Basra⁠ ⁠… leaving Parliament Building for his palace outside the city⁠ ⁠… fanatic, identified as an Egyptian named Mohammed Noureed⁠ ⁠… old American submachine-gun⁠ ⁠… two guards killed and a third seriously wounded⁠ ⁠… seized by infuriated mob and stoned to death on the spot.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>For a moment, he felt guilt, until he realized that nothing he could have done could have altered the event. The death of Khalid ib’n Hussein, and all the millions of other deaths that would follow it, were fixed in the matrix of the space-time continuum. Including, maybe, the death of an obscure professor of Modern History named Edward Chalmers.</p>
			<p>“At least, this’ll be the end of that silly flap about what happened a month ago in Modern Four. This is modern history, now; I can talk about it without a lot of fools yelling their heads off.”</p>
			<p>She was staring at him wide-eyed. No doubt horrified at his cold-blooded attitude toward what was really a shocking and senseless crime.</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course; the man’s dead. So’s Julius Caesar, but we’ve gotten over being shocked at his murder.”</p>
			<p>He would have to talk about it in Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, he supposed; explain why Khalid’s death was necessary to the policies of the Eastern Axis, and what the consequences would be. How it would hasten the complete dissolution of the old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr>, already weakened by the crisis over the Eastern demands for the demilitarization and internationalization of the United States Lunar Base, and necessitate the formation of the Terran Federation, and how it would lead, eventually, to the Thirty Days’ War. No, he couldn’t talk about that; that was on the wrong side of the knife-edge. Have to be careful about the knife-edge; too easy to cut himself on it.</p>

			<p>Nobody in Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> was seated when he entered the room; they were all crowded between the door and his desk. He stood blinking, wondering why they were giving him an ovation, and why Kendrick and Dacre were so abjectly apologetic. Great heavens, did it take the murder of the greatest Muslim since Saladin to convince people that he wasn’t crazy?</p>
			<p>Before the period was over, Whitburn’s secretary entered with a note in the college president’s hand and over his signature; requesting Chalmers to come to his office immediately and without delay. Just like that; expected him to walk right out of his class. He was protesting as he entered the president’s office. Whitburn cut him off short.</p>
			<p>“Doctor Chalmers,”⁠—Whitburn had risen behind his desk as the door opened⁠—“I certainly hope that you can realize that there was nothing but the most purely coincidental connection between the event featured in this morning’s newspapers and your performance, a month ago, in Modern History Four,” he began.</p>
			<p>“I realize nothing of the sort. The death of Khalid ib’n Hussein is a fact of history, unalterably set in its proper place in time-sequence. It was a fact of history a month ago no less than today.”</p>
			<p>“So that’s going to be your attitude; that your wild utterances of a month ago have now been vindicated as fulfilled prophesies? And I suppose you intend to exploit this⁠—this coincidence⁠—to the utmost. The involvement of Blanley College in a mess of sensational publicity means nothing to you, I presume.”</p>
			<p>“I haven’t any idea what you’re talking about.”</p>
			<p>“You mean to tell me that you didn’t give this story to the local newspaper, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Valley Times</i>?” Whitburn demanded.</p>
			<p>“I did not. I haven’t mentioned the subject to anybody connected with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Times</i>, or anybody else, for that matter. Except my attorney, a month ago, when you were threatening to repudiate the contract you signed with me.”</p>
			<p>“I suppose I’m expected to take your word for that?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, you are. Unless you care to call me a liar in so many words.” He moved a step closer. Lloyd Whitburn outweighed him by fifty pounds, but most of the difference was fat. Whitburn must have realized that, too.</p>
			<p>“No, no; if you say you haven’t talked about it to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Valley Times</i>, that’s enough,” he said hastily. “But somebody did. A reporter was here not twenty minutes ago; he refused to say who had given him the story, but he wanted to question me about it.”</p>
			<p>“What did you tell him?”</p>
			<p>“I refused to make any statement whatever. I also called Colonel Tighlman, the owner of the paper, and asked him, very reasonably, to suppress the story. I thought that my own position and the importance of Blanley College to this town entitled me to that much consideration.” Whitburn’s face became almost purple. “He⁠ ⁠… he laughed at me!”</p>
			<p>“Newspaper people don’t like to be told to kill stories. Not even by college presidents. That’s only made things worse. Personally, I don’t relish the prospect of having this publicized, any more than you do. I can assure you that I shall be most guarded if any of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Times</i> reporters talk to me about it, and if I have time to get back to my class before the end of the period, I shall ask them, as a personal favor, not to discuss the matter outside.”</p>
			<p>Whitburn didn’t take the hint. Instead, he paced back and forth, storming about the reporter, the newspaper owner, whoever had given the story to the paper, and finally Chalmers himself. He was livid with rage.</p>
			<p>“You certainly can’t imagine that when you made those remarks in class you actually possessed any knowledge of a thing that was still a month in the future,” he spluttered. “Why, it’s ridiculous! Utterly preposterous!”</p>
			<p>“Unusual, I’ll admit. But the fact remains that I did. I should, of course, have been more careful, and not confused future with past events. The students didn’t understand.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Whitburn half-turned, stopping short.</p>
			<p>“My God, man! You <em>are</em> crazy!” he cried, horrified.</p>
			<p>The period-bell was ringing as he left Whitburn’s office; that meant that the twenty-three students were scattering over the campus, talking like mad. He shrugged. Keeping them quiet about a thing like this wouldn’t have been possible in any case. When he entered his office, Stanly Weill was waiting for him. The lawyer drew him out into the hallway quickly.</p>
			<p>“For God’s sake, have you been talking to the papers?” he demanded. “After what I told you.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“No, but somebody has.” He told about the call to Whitburn’s office, and the latter’s behavior. Weill cursed the college president bitterly.</p>
			<p>“Any time you want to get a story in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Valley Times</i>, just order Frank Tighlman not to print it. Well, if you haven’t talked, don’t.”</p>
			<p>“Suppose somebody asks me?”</p>
			<p>“A reporter, no comment. Anybody else, none of his damn business. And above all, don’t let anybody finagle you into making any claims about knowing the future. I thought we had this under control; now that it’s out in the open, what that fool Whitburn’ll do is anybody’s guess.”</p>
			<p>Leonard Fitch met him as he entered the Faculty Club, sizzling with excitement.</p>
			<p>“Ed, this has done it!” he began, jubilantly. “This is one nobody can laugh off. It’s direct proof of precognition, and because of the prominence of the event, everybody will hear about it. And it simply can’t be dismissed as coincidence.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Whitburn’s trying to do that.”</p>
			<p>“Whitburn’s a fool if he is,” another man said calmly. Turning, he saw that the speaker was Tom Smith, one of the math professors. “I figured the odds against that being chance. There are a lot of variables that might affect it one way or another, but ten to the fifteenth power is what I get for a sort of median figure.”</p>
			<p>“Did you give that story to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Valley Times</i>?” he asked Fitch, suspicion rising and dragging anger up after it.</p>
			<p>“Of course, I did,” Fitch said. “I’ll admit, I had to go behind your back and have some of my postgrads get statements from the boys in your history class, but you wouldn’t talk about it yourself.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Tom Smith was standing beside him. He was twenty years younger than Chalmers, he was an amateur boxer, and he had good reflexes. He caught Chalmers’ arm as it was traveling back for an uppercut, and held it.</p>
			<p>“Take it easy, Ed; you don’t want to start a slugfest in here. This is the Faculty Club; remember?”</p>
			<p>“I won’t, Tom; it wouldn’t prove anything if I did.” He turned to Fitch. “I won’t talk about sending your students to pump mine, but at least you could have told me before you gave that story out.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what you’re sore about,” Fitch defended himself. “I believed in you when everybody else thought you were crazy, and if I hadn’t collected signed and dated statements from your boys, there’d have been no substantiation. It happens that extrasensory perception means as much to me as history does to you. I’ve believed in it ever since I read about Rhine’s work, when I was a kid. I worked in <abbr epub:type="z3998:acronym">ESP</abbr> for a long time. Then I had a chance to get a full professorship by coming here, and after I did, I found that I couldn’t go on with it, because Whitburn’s president here, and he’s a stupid old bigot with an air-locked mind.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” His anger died down as Fitch spoke. “I’m glad Tom stopped me from making an ass of myself. I can see your side of it.” Maybe that was the curse of the professional intellectual, an ability to see everybody’s side of everything. He thought for a moment. “What else did you do, beside hand this story to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Valley Times</i>? I’d better hear all about it.”</p>
			<p>“I phoned the secretary of the American Institute of Psionics and Parapsychology, as soon as I saw this morning’s paper. With the time-difference to the East Coast, I got him just as he reached his office. He advised me to give the thing the widest possible publicity; he thought that would advance the recognition and study of parapsychology. A case like this can’t be ignored; it will demand serious study.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Well, you got your publicity, all right. I’m up to my neck in it.”</p>
			<p>There was an uproar outside. The doorman was saying, firmly:</p>
			<p>“This is the Faculty Club, gentlemen; it’s for members only. I don’t care if you gentlemen are the press, you simply cannot come in here.”</p>
			<p>“We’re all up to our necks in it,” Smith said. “Leonard, I don’t care what your motives were, you ought to have considered the effect on the rest of us first.”</p>
			<p>“This place will be a madhouse,” Handley complained. “How we’re going to get any of these students to keep their minds on their work.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“I tell you, I don’t know a confounded thing about it,” Max Pottgeiter’s voice rose petulantly at the door. “Are you trying to tell me that Professor Chalmers murdered some Arab? Ridiculous!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He ate hastily and without enjoyment, and slipped through the kitchen and out the back door, cutting between two frat-houses and circling back to Prescott Hall. On the way, he paused momentarily and chuckled. The reporters, unable to storm the Faculty Club, had gone off in chase of other game and had cornered Lloyd Whitburn in front of Administration Center. They had a jeep with a sound-camera mounted on it, and were trying to get something for telecast. After gesticulating angrily, Whitburn broke away from them and dashed up the steps and into the building. A campus policeman stopped those who tried to follow.</p>
			<p>His only afternoon class was American History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. He got through it somehow, though the class wasn’t able to concentrate on the Reconstruction and the first election of Grover Cleveland. The halls were free of reporters, at least, and when it was over he hurried to the Library, going to the faculty reading-room in the rear, where he could smoke. There was nobody there but old Max Pottgeiter, smoking a cigar, his head bent over a book. The Medieval History professor looked up.</p>
			<p>“Oh, hello, Chalmers. What the deuce is going on around here? Has everybody gone suddenly crazy?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Well, they seem to think I have,” he said bitterly.</p>
			<p>“They do? Stupid of them. What’s all this about some Arab being shot? I didn’t know there were any Arabs around here.”</p>
			<p>“Not here. At Basra.” He told Pottgeiter what had happened.</p>
			<p>“Well! I’m sorry to hear about that,” the old man said. “I have a friend at Southern California, Bellingham, who knew Khalid very well. Was in the Middle East doing some research on the Byzantine Empire; Khalid was most helpful. Bellingham was quite impressed by him; said he was a wonderful man, and a fine scholar. Why would anybody want to kill a man like that?”</p>
			<p>He explained in general terms. Pottgeiter nodded understandingly: assassination was a familiar feature of the medieval political landscape, too. Chalmers went on to elaborate. It was a relief to talk to somebody like Pottgeiter, who wasn’t bothered by the present moment, but simply boycotted it. Eventually, the period-bell rang. Pottgeiter looked at his watch, as from conditioned reflex, and then rose, saying that he had a class and excusing himself. He would have carried his cigar with him if Chalmers hadn’t taken it away from him.</p>
			<p>After Pottgeiter had gone Chalmers opened a book⁠—he didn’t notice what it was⁠—and sat staring unseeing at the pages. So the moving knife-edge had come down on the end of Khalid ib’n Hussein’s life; what were the events in the next segment of time, and the segments to follow? There would be bloody fighting all over the Middle East⁠—with consternation, he remembered that he had been talking about that to Pottgeiter. The Turkish army would move in and try to restore order. There would be more trouble in northern Iran, the Indian Communists would invade Eastern Pakistan, and then the general war, so long dreaded, would come. How far in the future that was he could not “remember,” nor how the nuclear-weapons stalemate that had so far prevented it would be broken. He knew that today, and for years before, nobody had dared start an all-out atomic war. Wars, now, were marginal skirmishes, like the one in Indonesia, or the steady underground conflict of subversion and sabotage that had come to be called the Subwar. And with the United States already in possession of a powerful Lunar base.⁠ ⁠… He wished he could “remember” how events between the murder of Khalid and the Thirty Day’s War had been spaced chronologically. Something of that had come to him, after the incident in Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, and he had driven it from his consciousness.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He didn’t dare go home where the reporters would be sure to find him. He simply left the college, at the end of the school-day, and walked without conscious direction until darkness gathered. This morning, when he had seen the paper, he had said, and had actually believed, that the news of the murder in Basra would put an end to the trouble that had started a month ago in the Modern History class. It hadn’t: the trouble, it seemed, was only beginning. And with the newspapers, and Whitburn, and Fitch, it could go on forever.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>It was fully dark, now; his shadow fell ahead of him on the sidewalk, lengthening as he passed under and beyond a streetlight, vanishing as he entered the stronger light of the one ahead. The windows of a cheap café reminded him that he was hungry, and he entered, going to a table and ordering something absently. There was a television screen over the combination bar and lunch-counter. Some kind of a comedy programme, at which an invisible studio-audience was laughing immoderately and without apparent cause. The roughly dressed customers along the counter didn’t seem to see any more humor in it than he did. Then his food arrived on the table and he began to eat without really tasting it.</p>
			<p>After a while, an alteration in the noises from the television penetrated his consciousness; a news-program had come on, and he raised his head. The screen showed a square in an Eastern city; the voice was saying:</p>
			<p>“… Basra, where Khalid ib’n Hussein was assassinated early this morning⁠—early afternoon, local time. This is the scene of the crime; the body of the murderer has been removed, but you can still see the stones with which he was pelted to death by the mob.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>A closeup of the square, still littered with torn-up paving-stones. A Caliphate army officer, displaying the weapon⁠—it was an old M3, all right; Chalmers had used one of those things, himself, thirty years before, and he and his contemporaries had called it a “grease-gun.” There were some recent pictures of Khalid, including one taken as he left the plane on his return from Ankara. He watched, absorbed; it was all exactly as he had “remembered” a month ago. It gratified him to see that his future “memories” were reliable in detail as well as generality.</p>
			<p>“But the most amazing part of the story comes, not from Basra, but from Blanley College, in California,” the commentator was saying, “where, it is revealed, the murder of Khalid was foretold, with uncanny accuracy, a month ago, by a history professor, Doctor Edward Chalmers.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>There was a picture of himself, in hat and overcoat, perfectly motionless, as though a brief moving glimpse were being prolonged. A glance at the background told him when and where it had been taken⁠—a year and a half ago, at a convention at Harvard. These telecast people must save up every inch of old news-film they ever took. There were views of Blanley campus, and interviews with some of the Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> boys, including Dacre and Kendrick. That was one of the things they’d been doing with that jeep-mounted sound-camera, this afternoon, then. The boys, some brashly, some embarrassedly, were substantiating the fact that he had, a month ago, described yesterday’s event in detail. There was an interview with Leonard Fitch; the psychology professor was trying to explain the phenomenon of precognition in layman’s terms, and making heavy going of it. And there was the mobbing of Whitburn in front of Administration Center. The college president was shouting denials of every question asked him, and as he turned and fled, the guffaws of the reporters were plainly audible.</p>
			<p>An argument broke out along the counter.</p>
			<p>“I don’t believe it! How could anybody know all that about something before it happened?”</p>
			<p>“Well, you heard that-there professor, what was his name. An’ you heard all them boys.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Ah, college-boys; they’ll do anything for a joke!”</p>
			<p>“After refusing to be interviewed for telecast, the president of Blanley College finally consented to hold a press conference in his office, from which telecast cameras were barred. He denied the whole story categorically and stated that the boys in Professor Chalmers’ class had concocted the whole thing as a hoax.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“There! See what I told you!”</p>
			<p>“… stating that Professor Chalmers is mentally unsound, and that he has been trying for years to oust him from his position on the Blanley faculty but has been unable to do so because of the provisions of the Faculty Tenure Act of 1963. Most of his remarks were in the nature of a polemic against this law, generally regarded as the college professors’ bill of rights. It is to be stated here that other members of the Blanley faculty have unconditionally confirmed the fact that Doctor Chalmers did make the statements attributed to him a month ago, long before the death of Khalid ib’n Hussein.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Yah! How about <em>that</em>, now? How’ya gonna get around <em>that</em>?”</p>
			<p>Beckoning the waitress, he paid his check and hurried out. Before he reached the door, he heard a voice, almost stuttering with excitement:</p>
			<p>“Hey! Look! That’s <em>him</em>!”</p>
			<p>He began to run. He was two blocks from the café before he slowed to a walk again.</p>
			<p>That night, he needed three shots of whiskey before he could get to sleep.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A delegation from the American Institute of Psionics and Parapsychology reached Blanley that morning, having taken a strato-plane from the East Coast. They had academic titles and degrees that even Lloyd Whitburn couldn’t ignore. They talked with Leonard Fitch, and with the students from Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, and took statements. It wasn’t until after General European History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> that they caught up with Chalmers⁠—an elderly man, with white hair and a ruddy face; a young man who looked like a heavyweight boxer; a middle-aged man in tweeds who smoked a pipe and looked as though he ought to be more interested in grouse-shooting and flower-gardening than in clairvoyance and telepathy. The names of the first two meant nothing to Chalmers. They were important names in their own field, but it was not his field. The name of the third, who listened silently, he did not catch.</p>
			<p>“You understand, gentlemen, that I’m having some difficulties with the college administration about this,” he told them. “President Whitburn has even gone so far as to challenge my fitness to hold a position here.”</p>
			<p>“We’ve talked to him,” the elderly man said. “It was not a very satisfactory discussion.”</p>
			<p>“President Whitburn’s fitness to hold his own position could very easily be challenged,” the young man added pugnaciously.</p>
			<p>“Well, then, you see what my position is. I’ve consulted my attorney, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Weill and he has advised me to make absolutely no statements of any sort about the matter.”</p>
			<p>“I understand,” the eldest of the trio said. “But we’re not the press, or anything like that. We can assure you that anything you tell us will be absolutely confidential.” He looked inquiringly at the middle-aged man in tweeds, who nodded silently. “We can understand that the students in your modern history class are telling what is substantially the truth?”</p>
			<p>“If you’re thinking about that hoax statement of Whitburn’s, that’s a lot of idiotic drivel!” he said angrily. “I heard some of those boys on the telecast, last night; except for a few details in which they were confused, they all stated exactly what they heard me say in class a month ago.”</p>
			<p>“And we assume,”⁠—again he glanced at the man in tweeds⁠—“that you had no opportunity of knowing anything, at the time, about any actual plot against Khalid’s life?”</p>
			<p>The man in tweeds broke silence for the first time. “You can assume that. I don’t even think this fellow Noureed knew anything about it, then.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we’d like to know, as nearly as you’re able to tell us, just how you became the percipient of this knowledge of the future event of the death of Khalid ib’n Hussein,” the young man began. “Was it through a dream, or a waking experience; did you visualize, or have an auditory impression, or did it simply come into your mind.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“I’m sorry, gentlemen.” He looked at his watch. “I have to be going somewhere, at once. In any case, I simply can’t discuss the matter with you. I appreciate your position; I know how I’d feel if data of historical importance were being withheld from me. However, I trust that you will appreciate my position and spare me any further questioning.”</p>
			<p>That was all he allowed them to get out of him. They spent another few minutes being polite to one another; he invited them to lunch at the Faculty Club, and learned that they were lunching there as Fitch’s guests. They went away trying to hide their disappointment.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Psionics and Parapsychology people weren’t the only delegation to reach Blanley that day. Enough of the trustees of the college lived in the San Francisco area to muster a quorum for a meeting the evening before; a committee, including James Dacre, the father of the boy in Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, was appointed to get the facts at first hand; they arrived about noon. They talked to some of the students, spent some time closeted with Whitburn, and were seen crossing the campus with the Parapsychology people. They didn’t talk to Chalmers or Fitch. In the afternoon, Marjorie Fenner told Chalmers that his presence at a meeting, to be held that evening in Whitburn’s office, was requested. The request, she said, had come from the trustees’ committee, not from Whitburn; she also told him that Fitch would be there. Chalmers promptly phoned Stanly Weill.</p>
			<p>“I’ll be there along with you,” the lawyer said. “If this trustees’ committee is running it, they’ll realize that this is a matter in which you’re entitled to legal advice. I’ll stop by your place and pick you up.⁠ ⁠… You haven’t been doing any talking, have you?”</p>
			<p>He described the interview with the Psionics and Parapsychology people.</p>
			<p>“That was all right.⁠ ⁠… Was there a man with a mustache, in a brown tweed suit, with them?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. I didn’t catch his name.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“It’s Cutler. He’s an Army major; Central Intelligence. His crowd’s interested in whether you had any real advance information on this. He was in to see me, just a while ago. I have the impression he’d like to see this whole thing played down, so he’ll be on our side, more or less and for the time being. I’ll be around to your place about eight; in the meantime, don’t do any more talking than you have to. I hope we can get this straightened out, this evening. I’ll have to go to Reno in a day or so to see a client there.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The meeting in Whitburn’s office had been set for eight-thirty; Weill saw to it that they arrived exactly on time. As they got out of his car at Administration Center and crossed to the steps, Chalmers had the feeling of going to a duel, accompanied by his second. The briefcase Weill was carrying may have given him the idea; it was flat and square-cornered, the size and shape of an old case of dueling pistols. He commented on it.</p>
			<p>“Sound recorder,” Weill said. “Loaded with a four-hour spool. No matter how long this thing lasts, I’ll have a record of it, if I want to produce one in court.”</p>
			<p>Another party was arriving at the same time⁠—the two Psionics and Parapsychology people and the Intelligence major, who seemed to have formed a working partnership. They all entered together, after a brief and guardedly polite exchange of greetings. There were voices raised in argument inside when they came to Whitburn’s office. The college president was trying to keep Handley, Tom Smith, and Max Pottgeiter from entering his private room in the rear.</p>
			<p>“It certainly is!” Handley was saying. “As faculty members, any controversy involving establishment of standards of fitness to teach under a tenure-contract concerns all of us, because any action taken in this case may establish a precedent which could affect the validity of our own contracts.”</p>
			<p>A big man with iron-gray hair appeared in the doorway of the private office behind Whitburn; James Dacre.</p>
			<p>“These gentlemen have a substantial interest in this, Doctor Whitburn,” he said. “If they’re here as representatives of the college faculty, they have every right to be present.”</p>
			<p>Whitburn stood aside. Handley, Smith and Pottgeiter went through the door; the others followed. The other three members of the trustees’ committee were already in the room. A few minutes later, Leonard Fitch arrived, also carrying a briefcase.</p>
			<p>“Well, everybody seems to be here,” Whitburn said, starting toward his chair behind the desk. “We might as well get this started.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. If you’ll excuse me, Doctor.” Dacre stepped in front of him and sat down at the desk. “I’ve been selected as chairman of this committee; I believe I’m presiding here. Start the recorder, somebody.”</p>
			<p>One of the other trustees went to the sound recorder beside the desk⁠—a larger but probably not more efficient instrument than the one Weill had concealed in his briefcase⁠—and flipped a switch. Then he and his companions dragged up chairs to flank Dacre’s, and the rest seated themselves around the room. Old Pottgeiter took a seat next to Chalmers. Weill opened the case on his lap, reached inside, and closed it again.</p>
			<p>“What are they trying to do, Ed?” Pottgeiter asked, in a loud whisper. “Throw you off the faculty? They can’t do that, can they?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t know, Max. We’ll see.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“This isn’t any formal hearing, and nobody’s on trial here,” Dacre was saying. “Any action will have to be taken by the board of trustees as a whole, at a regularly scheduled meeting. All we’re trying to do is find out just what’s happened here, and who, if anybody, is responsible.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Well, there’s the man who’s responsible!” Whitburn cried, pointing at Chalmers. “This whole thing grew out of his behavior in class a month ago, and I’ll remind you that at the time I demanded his resignation!”</p>
			<p>“I thought it was Doctor Fitch, here, who gave the story to the newspapers,” one of the trustees, a man with red hair and a thin, eyeglassed face, objected.</p>
			<p>“Doctor Fitch acted as any scientist should, in making public what he believed to be an important scientific discovery,” the elder of the two Parapsychology men said. “He believed, and so do we, that he had discovered a significant instance of precognition⁠—a case of real prior knowledge of a future event. He made a careful and systematic record of Professor Chalmers’ statements, at least two weeks before the occurrence of the event to which they referred. It is entirely due to him that we know exactly what Professor Chalmers said and when he said it.”</p>
			<p>“Yes,” his younger colleague added, “and in all my experience I’ve never heard anything more preposterous than this man Whitburn’s attempt, yesterday, to deny the fact.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we’re convinced that Doctor Chalmers did in fact say what he’s alleged to have said, last month,” Dacre began.</p>
			<p>“Jim, I think we ought to get that established, for the record,” another of the trustees put in. “Doctor Chalmers, is it true that you spoke, in the past tense, about the death of Khalid ib’n Hussein in one of your classes on the sixteenth of last month?”</p>
			<p>Chalmers rose. “Yes, it is. And the next day, I was called into this room by Doctor Whitburn, who demanded my resignation from the faculty of this college because of it. Now, what I’d like to know is, why did Doctor Whitburn, in this same room, deny, yesterday, that I’d said anything of the sort, and accuse my students of concocting the story after the event as a hoax.”</p>
			<p>“One of them being my son,” Dacre added. “I’d like to hear an answer to that, myself.”</p>
			<p>“So would I,” Stanly Weill chimed in. “You know, my client has a good case against Doctor Whitburn for libel.”</p>
			<p>Chalmers looked around the room. Of the thirteen men around him, only Whitburn was an enemy. Some of the others were on his side, for one reason or another, but none of them were friends. Weill was his lawyer, obeying an obligation to a client which, at bottom, was an obligation to his own conscience. Handley was afraid of the possibility that a precedent might be established which would impair his own tenure-contract. Fitch, and the two men from the Institute of Psionics and Parapsychology were interested in him as a source of study-material. Dacre resented a slur upon his son; he and the others were interested in Blanley College as an institution, almost an abstraction. And the major in mufti was probably worrying about the consequences to military security of having a prophet at large. Then a hand gripped his shoulder, and a voice whispered in his ear:</p>
			<p>“That’s good, Ed; don’t let them scare you!”</p>
			<p>Old Max Pottgeiter, at least, was a friend.</p>
			<p>“Doctor Whitburn, I’m asking you, and I expect an answer, why did you make such statements to the press, when you knew perfectly well that they were false?” Dacre demanded sharply.</p>
			<p>“I knew nothing of the kind!” Whitburn blustered, showing, under the bluster, fear. “Yes, I demanded this man’s resignation on the morning of October Seventeenth, the day after this incident occurred. It had come to my attention on several occasions that he was making wild and unreasonable assertions in class, and subjecting himself, and with himself the whole faculty of this college, to student ridicule. Why, there was actually an editorial about it written by the student editor of the campus paper, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Black and Green</i>. I managed to prevent its publication.⁠ ⁠…” He went on at some length about that. “If I might be permitted access to the drawers of my own desk,” he added with elephantine sarcasm, “I could show you the editorial in question.”</p>
			<p>“You needn’t bother; I have a carbon copy,” Dacre told him. “We’ve all read it. If you did, at the time you suppressed it, you should have known what Doctor Chalmers said in class.”</p>
			<p>“I knew he’d talked a lot of poppycock about a man who was still living having been shot to death,” Whitburn retorted. “And if something of the sort actually happened, what of it? Somebody’s always taking a shot at one or another of these foreign dictators, and they can’t miss all the time.”</p>
			<p>“You claim this was pure coincidence?” Fitch demanded. “A ten-point coincidence: Event of assassination, year of the event, place, circumstances, name of assassin, nationality of assassin, manner of killing, exact type of weapon used, guards killed and wounded along with Khalid, and fate of the assassin. If that’s a simple and plausible coincidence, so’s dealing ten royal flushes in succession in a poker game. Tom, you figured that out; what did you say the odds against it were?”</p>
			<p>“Was all that actually stated by Doctor Chalmers a month ago?” one of the trustees asked, incredulously.</p>
			<p>“It absolutely was. Look here, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Dacre, gentlemen.” Fitch came forward, unzipping his briefcase and pulling out papers. “Here are the signed statements of each of Doctor Chalmers’ twenty-three Modern History Four students, all made and dated before the assassination. You can refer to them as you please; they’re in alphabetical order. And here.” He unfolded a sheet of graph paper a yard long and almost as wide. “Here’s a tabulated summary of the boys’ statements. All agreed on the first point, the fact of the assassination. All agreed that the time was sometime this year. Twenty out of twenty-three agreed on Basra as the place. Why, seven of them even remembered the name of the assassin. That in itself is remarkable; Doctor Chalmers has an extremely intelligent and attentive class.”</p>
			<p>“They’re attentive because they know he’s always likely to do something crazy and make a circus out of himself,” Whitburn interjected.</p>
			<p>“And this isn’t the only instance of Doctor Chalmers’ precognitive ability,” Fitch continued. “There have been a number of other cases.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Chalmers jumped to his feet; Stanly Weill rose beside him, shoved the cased sound-recorder into his hands, and pushed him back into his seat.</p>
			<p>“Gentlemen,” the lawyer began, quietly but firmly and clearly. “This is all getting pretty badly out of hand. After all, this isn’t an investigation of the actuality of precognition as a psychic phenomenon. What I’d like to hear, and what I haven’t heard yet, is Doctor Whitburn’s explanation of his contradictory statements that he knew about my client’s alleged remarks on the evening after they were supposed to have been made and that, at the same time, the whole thing was a hoax concocted by his students.”</p>
			<p>“Are you implying that I’m a liar?” Whitburn bristled.</p>
			<p>“I’m pointing out that you made a pair of contradictory statements, and I’m asking how you could do that knowingly and honestly,” Weill retorted.</p>
			<p>“What I meant,” Whitburn began, with exaggerated slowness, as though speaking to an idiot, “was that yesterday, when those infernal reporters were badgering me, I really thought that some of Professor Chalmers’ students had gotten together and given the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Valley Times</i> an exaggerated story about his insane maunderings a month ago. I hadn’t imagined that a member of the faculty had been so lacking in loyalty to the college.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“You couldn’t imagine anybody with any more intellectual integrity than you have!” Fitch fairly yelled at him.</p>
			<p>“You’re as crazy as Chalmers!” Whitburn yelled back. He turned to the trustees. “You see the position I’m in, here, with this infernal Higher Education Faculty Tenure Act? I have a madman on my faculty, and can I get rid of him? No! I demand his resignation, and he laughs at me and goes running for his lawyer! And he is a madman! Nobody but a madman would talk the way he does. You think this Khalid ib’n Hussein business is the only time he’s done anything like this? Why, I have a list of a dozen occasions when he’s done something just as bad, only he didn’t have a lucky coincidence to back him up. Trying to get books that don’t exist out of the library, and then insisting that they’re standard textbooks. Talking about the revolt of the colonies on Mars and Venus. Talking about something he calls the Terran Federation, some kind of a world empire. Or something he calls Operation Triple Cross, that saved the country during some fantastic war he imagined.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“<em>What did you say?</em>”</p>
			<p>The question cracked out like a string of pistol shots. Everybody turned. The quiet man in the brown tweed suit had spoken; now he looked as though he were very much regretting it.</p>
			<p>“Is there such a thing as Operation Triple Cross?” Fitch was asking.</p>
			<p>“No, no. I never heard anything about that; that wasn’t what I meant. It was this Terran Federation thing,” the major said, a trifle too quickly and too smoothly. He turned to Chalmers. “You never did any work for <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.S.P.B.</abbr>; did you ever talk to anybody who did?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I don’t even know what the letters mean,” Chalmers replied.</p>
			<p>“Politico-Strategic Planning Board. It’s all pretty hush-hush, but this term Terran Federation is a tentative name for a proposed organization to take the place of the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.N.</abbr> if that organization breaks up. It’s nothing particularly important, and it only exists on paper.”</p>
			<p>It won’t exist only on paper very long, Chalmers thought. He was wondering what Operation Triple Cross was; he had some notes on it, but he had forgotten what they were.</p>
			<p>“Maybe he did pick that up from somebody who’d talked indiscreetly,” Whitburn conceded. “But the rest of this tommyrot! Why, he was talking about how the city of Reno had been destroyed by an explosion and fire, literally wiped off the map. There’s an example for you!”</p>
			<p>He’d forgotten about that, too. It had been a relatively minor incident in the secret struggle of the Subwar; now he remembered having made a note about it. He was sure that it followed closely after the assassination of Khalid ib’n Hussein. He turned quickly to Weill.</p>
			<p>“Didn’t you say you had to go to Reno in a day or so?” he asked.</p>
			<p>Weill hushed him urgently, pointing with his free hand to the recorder. The exchange prevented him from noticing that Max Pottgeiter had risen, until the old man was speaking.</p>
			<p>“Are you trying to tell these people that Professor Chalmers is crazy?” he was demanding. “Why, he has one of the best minds on the campus. I was talking to him only yesterday, in the back room at the Library. You know,” he went on apologetically, “my subject is Medieval History; I don’t pay much attention to what’s going on in the contemporary world, and I didn’t understand, really, what all this excitement was about. But he explained the whole thing to me, and did it in terms that I could grasp, drawing some excellent parallels with the Byzantine Empire and the Crusades. All about the revolt at Damascus, and the sack of Beirut, and the war between Jordan and Saudi Arabia, and how the Turkish army intervened, and the invasion of Pakistan.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“When did all this happen?” one of the trustees demanded.</p>
			<p>Pottgeiter started to explain; Chalmers realized, sickly, how much of his future history he had poured into the trusting ear of the old medievalist, the day before.</p>
			<p>“Good Lord, man; don’t you read the papers at all?” another of the trustees asked.</p>
			<p>“No! And I don’t read inside-dope magazines, or science fiction. I read carefully substantiated facts. And I know when I’m talking to a sane and reasonable man. It isn’t a common experience, around here.”</p>
			<p>Dacre passed a hand over his face. “Doctor Whitburn,” he said, “I must admit that I came to this meeting strongly prejudiced against you, and I’ll further admit that your own behavior here has done very little to dispel that prejudice. But I’m beginning to get some idea of what you have to contend with, here at Blanley, and I find that I must make a lot of allowances. I had no idea.⁠ ⁠… Simply no idea at all.”</p>
			<p>“Look, you’re getting a completely distorted picture of this, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Dacre,” Fitch broke in. “It’s precisely as I believed; Doctor Chalmers is an unusually gifted precognitive percipient. You’ve seen, gentlemen, how his complicated chain of precognitions about the death of Khalid has been proven veridical; I’d stake my life that every one of these precognitions will be similarly verified. And I’ll stake my professional reputation that the man is perfectly sane. Of course, abnormal psychology and psychopathology aren’t my subjects, but.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“They’re not my subjects, either,” Whitburn retorted, “but I know a lunatic by his ravings.”</p>
			<p>“Doctor Fitch is taking an entirely proper attitude,” Pottgeiter said, “in pointing out that abnormal psychology is a specialized branch, outside his own field. I wouldn’t dream, myself, of trying to offer a decisive opinion on some point of Roman, or Babylonian, history. Well, if the question of Doctor Chalmers’ sanity is at issue here, let’s consult somebody who specializes in insanity. I don’t believe that anybody here is qualified even to express an opinion on that subject, Doctor Whitburn least of all.”</p>
			<p>Whitburn turned on him angrily. “Oh, shut up, you doddering old fool!” he shouted. “Look; there’s another of them!” he told the trustees. “Another deadhead on the faculty that this Tenure Law keeps me from getting rid of. He’s as bad as Chalmers, himself. You just heard that string of nonsense he was spouting. Why, his courses have been noted among the students for years as snap courses in which nobody ever has to do any work.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Chalmers was on his feet again, thoroughly angry. Abuse of himself he could take; talking that way about gentle, learned, old Pottgeiter was something else.</p>
			<p>“I think Doctor Pottgeiter’s said the most reasonable thing I’ve heard since I came in here,” he declared. “If my sanity is to be questioned, I insist that it be questioned by somebody qualified to do so.”</p>
			<p>Weill set his recorder on the floor and jumped up beside him, trying to haul him back into his seat.</p>
			<p>“For God’s sake, man! Sit down and shut up!” he hissed.</p>
			<p>Chalmers shook off his hand. “No, I won’t shut up! This is the only way to settle this, once and for all. And when my sanity’s been vindicated, I’m going to sue this fellow.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Whitburn started to make some retort, then stopped short. After a moment, he smiled nastily.</p>
			<p>“Do I understand, Doctor Chalmers, that you would be willing to submit to psychiatric examination?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Don’t agree; you’re putting your foot in a trap!” Weill told him urgently.</p>
			<p>“Of course, I agree, as long as the examination is conducted by a properly qualified psychiatrist.”</p>
			<p>“How about Doctor Hauserman at Northern State Mental Hospital?” Whitburn asked quickly. “Would you agree to an examination by him?”</p>
			<p>“Excellent!” Fitch exclaimed. “One of the best men in the field. I’d accept his opinion unreservedly.”</p>
			<p>Weill started to object again; Chalmers cut him off. “Doctor Hauserman will be quite satisfactory to me. The only question is, would he be available?”</p>
			<p>“I think he would,” Dacre said, glancing at his watch. “I wonder if he could be reached now.” He got to his feet. “Telephone in your outer office, Doctor Whitburn? Fine. If you gentlemen will excuse me.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>It was a good fifteen minutes before he returned, smiling.</p>
			<p>“Well, gentlemen, it’s all arranged,” he said. “Doctor Hauserman is quite willing to examine Doctor Chalmers⁠—with the latter’s consent, of course.”</p>
			<p>“He’ll have it. In writing, if he wishes.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, I assured him on that point. He’ll be here about noon tomorrow⁠—it’s a hundred and fifty miles from the hospital, but the doctor flies his own plane⁠—and the examination can start at two in the afternoon. He seems familiar with the facilities of the psychology department, here; I assured him that they were at his disposal. Will that be satisfactory to you, Doctor Chalmers?”</p>
			<p>“I have a class at that time, but one of the instructors can take it over⁠—if holding classes will be possible around here tomorrow,” he said. “Now, if you gentlemen will pardon me, I think I’ll go home and get some sleep.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Weill came up to the apartment with him. He mixed a couple of drinks and they went into the living room with them.</p>
			<p>“Just in case you don’t know what you’ve gotten yourself into,” Weill said, “this Hauserman isn’t any ordinary couch-pilot; he’s the state psychiatrist. If he gets the idea you aren’t sane, he can commit you to a hospital, and I’ll bet that’s exactly what Whitburn had in mind when he suggested him. And I don’t trust this man Dacre. I thought he was on our side, at the start, but that was before your friends got into the act.” He frowned into his drink. “And I don’t like the way that Intelligence major was acting, toward the last. If he thinks you know something you are not supposed to, a mental hospital may be his idea of a good place to put you away.”</p>
			<p>“You don’t think this man Hauserman would allow himself to be influenced.⁠ ⁠… ? No. You just don’t think I’m sane. Do you?”</p>
			<p>“I know what Hauserman’ll think. He’ll think this future history business is a classical case of systematized schizoid delusion. I wish I’d never gotten into this case. I wish I’d never even heard of you! And another thing; in case you get past Hauserman all right, you can forget about that damage-suit bluff of mine. You would not stand a chance with it in court.”</p>
			<p>“In spite of what happened to Khalid?”</p>
			<p>“After tomorrow, I won’t stay in the same room with anybody who even mentions that name to me. Well, win or lose, it’ll be over tomorrow and then I can leave here.”</p>
			<p>“Did you tell me you were going to Reno?” Chalmers asked. “Don’t do it. You remember Whitburn mentioning how I spoke about an explosion there? It happened just a couple of days after the murder of Khalid. There was⁠—will be⁠—a trainload of high explosives in the railroad yard; it’ll be the biggest non-nuclear explosion since the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Mont Blanc</i> blew up in Halifax harbor in World War One.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Weill threw his drink into the fire; he must have avoided throwing the glass in with it by a last-second exercise of self-control.</p>
			<p>“Well,” he said, after a brief struggle to master himself. “One thing about the legal profession; you do hear the damnedest things.⁠ ⁠… Good night, Professor. And try⁠—please try, for the sake of your poor harried lawyer⁠—to keep your mouth shut about things like that, at least till after you get through with Hauserman. And when you’re talking to him, don’t, don’t, for heaven’s sake, <em>don’t</em>, volunteer anything!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The room was a pleasant, warmly-colored, place. There was a desk, much like the ones in the classrooms, and six or seven wicker armchairs. A lot of apparatus had been pushed back along the walls; the dust-covers were gay cretonne. There was a couch, with more apparatus, similarly covered, beside it. Hauserman was seated at the desk when Chalmers entered.</p>
			<p>He rose, and they shook hands. A man of about his own age, smooth-faced, partially bald. Chalmers tried to guess something of the man’s nature from his face, but could read nothing. A face well trained to keep its owner’s secrets.</p>
			<p>“Something to smoke, Professor,” he began, offering his cigarette case.</p>
			<p>“My pipe, if you don’t mind.” He got it out and filled it.</p>
			<p>“Any of those chairs,” Hauserman said, gesturing toward them.</p>
			<p>They were all arranged to face the desk. He sat down, lighting his pipe. Hauserman nodded approvingly; he was behaving calmly, and didn’t need being put at ease. They talked at random⁠—at least, Hauserman tried to make it seem so⁠—for some time about his work, his book about the French Revolution, current events. He picked his way carefully through the conversation, alert for traps which the psychiatrist might be laying for him. Finally, Hauserman said:</p>
			<p>“Would you mind telling me just why you felt it advisable to request a psychiatric examination, Professor?”</p>
			<p>“I didn’t request it. But when the suggestion was made, by one of my friends, in reply to some aspersions of my sanity, I agreed to it.”</p>
			<p>“Good distinction. And why was your sanity questioned? I won’t deny that I had heard of this affair, here, before <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Dacre called me, last evening, but I’d like to hear your version of it.”</p>
			<p>He went into that, from the original incident in Modern History <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, choosing every word carefully, trying to concentrate on making a good impression upon Hauserman, and at the same time finding that more “memories” of the future were beginning to seep past the barrier of his consciousness. He tried to dam them back; when he could not, he spoke with greater and greater care lest they leak into his speech.</p>
			<p>“I can’t recall the exact manner in which I blundered into it. The fact that I did make such a blunder was because I was talking extemporaneously and had wandered ahead of my text. I was trying to show the results of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War, and the partition of the Middle East into a loose collection of Arab states, and the passing of British and other European spheres of influence following the Second. You know, when you consider it, the Islamic Caliphate was inevitable; the surprising thing is that it was created by a man like Khalid.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>He was talking to gain time, and he suspected that Hauserman knew it. The “memories” were coming into his mind more and more strongly; it was impossible to suppress them. The period of anarchy following Khalid’s death would be much briefer, and much more violent, than he had previously thought. Tallal ib’n Khalid would be flying from England even now; perhaps he had already left the plane to take refuge among the black tents of his father’s Bedouins. The revolt at Damascus would break out before the end of the month; before the end of the year, the whole of Syria and Lebanon would be in bloody chaos, and the Turkish army would be on the march.</p>
			<p>“Yes. And you allowed yourself to be carried a little beyond the present moment, into the future, without realizing it? Is that it?”</p>
			<p>“Something like that,” he replied, wide awake to the trap Hauserman had set, and fearful that it might be a blind, to disguise the real trap. “History follows certain patterns. I’m not a Toynbean, by any manner of means, but any historian can see that certain forces generally tend to produce similar effects. For instance, space travel is now a fact; our government has at present a military base on Luna. Within our lifetimes⁠—certainly within the lifetimes of my students⁠—there will be explorations and attempts at colonization on Mars and Venus. You believe that, Doctor?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, unreservedly. I’m not supposed to talk about it, but I did some work on the Philadelphia Project, myself. I’d say that every major problem of interplanetary flight had been solved before the first robot rocket was landed on Luna.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. And when Mars and Venus are colonized, there will be the same historic situations, at least in general shape, as arose when the European powers were colonizing the New World, or, for that matter, when the Greek city-states were throwing out colonies across the Aegean. That’s the sort of thing we call projecting the past into the future through the present.”</p>
			<p>Hauserman nodded. “But how about the details? Things like the assassination of a specific personage. How can you extrapolate to a thing like that?”</p>
			<p>“Well.⁠ ⁠…” More “memories” were coming to the surface; he tried to crowd them back. “I do my projecting in what you might call fictionalized form; try to fill in the details from imagination. In the case of Khalid, I was trying to imagine what would happen if his influence were suddenly removed from Near Eastern and Middle Eastern, affairs. I suppose I constructed an imaginary scene of his assassination.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>He went on at length. Mohammed and Noureed were common enough names. The Middle East was full of old <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">U.S.</abbr> weapons. Stoning was the traditional method of execution; it diffused responsibility so that no individual could be singled out for blood-feud vengeance.</p>
			<p>“You have no idea how disturbed I was when the whole thing happened, exactly as I had described it,” he continued. “And worst of all, to me, was this Intelligence officer showing up; I thought I was really in for it!”</p>
			<p>“Then you’ve never really believed that you had real knowledge of the future?”</p>
			<p>“I’m beginning to, since I’ve been talking to these Psionics and Parapsychology people,” he laughed. It sounded, he hoped, like a natural and unaffected laugh. “They seem to be convinced that I have.”</p>
			<p>There would be an Eastern-inspired uprising in Azerbaijan by the middle of the next year; before autumn, the Indian Communists would make their fatal attempt to seize East Pakistan. The Thirty Days’ War would be the immediate result. By that time, the Lunar Base would be completed and ready; the enemy missiles would be aimed primarily at the rocketports from which it was supplied. Delivered without warning, it should have succeeded⁠—except that every rocketport had its secret duplicate and triplicate. That was Operation Triple Cross; no wonder Major Cutler had been so startled at the words, last evening. The enemy would be utterly overwhelmed under the rain of missiles from across space, but until the moon-rockets began to fall, the United States would suffer grievously.</p>
			<p>“Honestly, though, I feel sorry for my friend Fitch,” he added. “He’s going to be frightfully let down when some more of my alleged prophecies misfire on him. But I really haven’t been deliberately deceiving him.”</p>
			<p>And Blanley College was at the center of one of the areas which would receive the worst of the thermonuclear hell to come. And it would be a little under a year.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>“And that’s all there is to it!” Hauserman exclaimed, annoyance in his voice. “I’m amazed that this man Whitburn allowed a thing like this to assume the proportions it did. I must say that I seem to have gotten the story about this business in a very garbled form indeed.” He laughed shortly. “I came here convinced that you were mentally unbalanced. I hope you won’t take that the wrong way, Professor,” he hastened to add. “In my profession, anything can be expected. A good psychiatrist can never afford to forget how sharp and fine is the knife-edge.”</p>
			<p>“The knife-edge!” The words startled him. He had been thinking, at that moment, of the knife-edge, slicing moment after moment relentlessly away from the future, into the past, at each slice coming closer and closer to the moment when the missiles of the Eastern Axis would fall. “I didn’t know they still resorted to surgery, in mental cases,” he added, trying to cover his break.</p>
			<p>“Oh, no; all that sort of thing is as irrevocably discarded as the whips and shackles of Bedlam. I meant another kind of knife-edge; the thin, almost invisible, line which separates sanity from non-sanity. From madness, to use a deplorable lay expression.” Hauserman lit another cigarette. “Most minds are a lot closer to it than their owners suspect, too. In fact, Professor, I was so convinced that yours had passed over it that I brought with me a commitment form, made out all but my signature, for you.” He took it from his pocket and laid it on the desk. “The modern equivalent of the lettre-de-cachet, I suppose the author of a book on the French Revolution would call it. I was all ready to certify you as mentally unsound, and commit you to Northern State Mental Hospital.”</p>
			<p>Chalmers sat erect in his chair. He knew where that was; on the other side of the mountains, in the one part of the state completely untouched by the H-bombs of the Thirty Days’ War. Why, the town outside which the hospital stood had been a military headquarters during the period immediately after the bombings, and the center from which all the rescue work in the state had been directed.</p>
			<p>“And you thought you could commit me to Northern State!” he demanded, laughing scornfully, and this time he didn’t try to make the laugh sound natural and unaffected. “You⁠—confine <em>me</em>, anywhere? Confine a poor old history professor’s body, yes, but that isn’t me. I’m universal; I exist in all space-time. When this old body I’m wearing now was writing that book on the French Revolution, I was in Paris, watching it happen, from the fall of the Bastile to the Ninth Thermidor. I was in Basra, and saw that crazed tool of the Axis shoot down Khalid ib’n Hussein⁠—and the professor talked about it a month before it happened. I have seen empires rise and stretch from star to star across the Galaxy, and crumble and fall. I have seen.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>Doctor Hauserman had gotten his pen out of his pocket and was signing the commitment form with one hand; with the other, he pressed a button on the desk. A door at the rear opened, and a large young man in a white jacket entered.</p>
			<p>“You’ll have to go away for a while, Professor,” Hauserman was telling him, much later, after he had allowed himself to become calm again. “For how long, I don’t know. Maybe a year or so.”</p>
			<p>“You mean to Northern State Mental?”</p>
			<p>“Well.⁠ ⁠… Yes, Professor. You’ve had a bad crack-up. I don’t suppose you realize how bad. You’ve been working too hard; harder than your nervous system could stand. It’s been too much for you.”</p>
			<p>“You mean, I’m nuts?”</p>
			<p>“Please, Professor. I deplore that sort of terminology. You’ve had a severe psychological breakdown.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“Will I be able to have books, and papers, and work a little? I couldn’t bear the prospect of complete idleness.”</p>
			<p>“That would be all right, if you didn’t work too hard.”</p>
			<p>“And could I say goodbye to some of my friends?”</p>
			<p>Hauserman nodded and asked, “Who?”</p>
			<p>“Well, Professor Pottgeiter.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“He’s outside now. He was inquiring about you.”</p>
			<p>“And Stanly Weill, my attorney. Not business; just to say goodbye.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, I’m sorry, Professor. He’s not in town, now. He left almost immediately after.⁠ ⁠… After.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“After he found out I was crazy for sure? Where’d he go?”</p>
			<p>“To Reno; he took the plane at five o’clock.”</p>
			<p>Weill wouldn’t have believed, anyhow; no use trying to blame himself for that. But he was as sure that he would never see Stanly Weill alive again as he was that the next morning the sun would rise. He nodded impassively.</p>
			<p>“Sorry he couldn’t stay. Can I see Max Pottgeiter alone?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, of course, Professor.”</p>
			<p>Old Pottgeiter came in, his face anguished. “Ed! It isn’t true,” he stammered. “I won’t believe that it’s true.”</p>
			<p>“What, Max?”</p>
			<p>“That you’re crazy. Nobody can make me believe that.”</p>
			<p>He put his hand on the old man’s shoulder. “Confidentially, Max, neither do I. But don’t tell anybody I’m not. It’s a secret.”</p>
			<p>Pottgeiter looked troubled. For a moment, he seemed to be wondering if he mightn’t be wrong and Hauserman and Whitburn and the others right.</p>
			<p>“Max, do you believe in me?” he asked. “Do you believe that I knew about Khalid’s assassination a month before it happened?”</p>
			<p>“It’s a horribly hard thing to believe,” Pottgeiter admitted. “But, dammit, Ed, you did! I know, medieval history is full of stories about prophecies being fulfilled. I always thought those stories were just legends that grew up after the event. And, of course, he’s about a century late for me, but there was Nostradamus. Maybe those old prophecies weren’t just ex post facto legends, after all. Yes. After Khalid, I’ll believe that.”</p>
			<p>“All right. I’m saying, now, that in a few days there’ll be a bad explosion at Reno, Nevada. Watch the papers and the telecast for it. If it happens, that ought to prove it. And you remember what I told you about the Turks annexing Syria and Lebanon?” The old man nodded. “When that happens, get away from Blanley. Come up to the town where Northern State Mental Hospital is, and get yourself a place to live, and stay there. And try to bring Marjorie Fenner along with you. Will you do that, Max?”</p>
			<p>“If you say so.” His eyes widened. “Something bad’s going to happen here?”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Max. Something very bad. You promise me you will?”</p>
			<p>“Of course, Ed. You know, you’re the only friend I have around here. You and Marjorie. I’ll come, and bring her along.”</p>
			<p>“Here’s the key to my apartment.” He got it from his pocket and gave it to Pottgeiter, with instructions. “Everything in the filing cabinet on the left of my desk. And don’t let anybody else see any of it. Keep it safe for me.”</p>
			<p>The large young man in the white coat entered.</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Keeper</h2>
			<p>When he heard the deer crashing through brush and scuffling the dead leaves, he stopped and stood motionless in the path. He watched them bolt down the slope from the right and cross in front of him, wishing he had the rifle, and when the last white tail vanished in the gray-brown woods he drove the spike of the ice-staff into the stiffening ground and took both hands to shift the weight of the pack. If he’d had the rifle, he could have shot only one of them. As it was, they were unfrightened, and he knew where to find them in the morning.</p>
			<p>Ahead, to the west and north, low clouds massed; the white front of the Ice-Father loomed clear and sharp between them and the blue of the distant forests. It would snow, tonight. If it stopped at daybreak, he would have good tracking, and in any case, it would be easier to get the carcasses home over snow. He wrenched loose the ice-staff and started forward again, following the path that wound between and among and over the irregular mounds and hillocks. It was still an hour’s walk to Keeper’s House, and the daylight was fading rapidly.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, when he was not so weary and in so much haste, he would loiter here, wondering about the ancient buildings and the long-vanished people who had raised them. There had been no woods at all, then; nothing but great houses like mountains, piling up toward the sky, and the valley where he meant to hunt tomorrow had been an arm of the sea that was now a three days’ foot-journey away. Some said that the cities had been destroyed and the people killed in wars⁠—big wars, not squabbles like the fights between sealing-companies from different villages. He didn’t think so, himself. It was more likely that they had all left their homes and gone away in starships when the Ice-Father had been born and started pushing down out of the north. There had been many starships, then. When he had been a boy, the old men had talked about a long-ago time when there had been hundreds of them visible in the sky, every morning and evening. But that had been long ago indeed. Starships came but seldom to this world, now. This world was old and lonely and poor. Like poor lonely old Raud the Keeper.</p>
			<p>He felt angry to find himself thinking like that. Never pity yourself, Raud; be proud. That was what his father had always taught him: “Be proud, for you are the Keeper’s son, and when I am gone, you will be the Keeper after me. But in your pride, be humble, for what you will keep is the Crown.”</p>
			<p>The thought of the Crown, never entirely absent from his mind, wakened the anxiety that always slept lightly if at all. He had been away all day, and there were so many things that could happen. The path seemed longer, after that; the landmarks farther apart. Finally, he came out on the edge of the steep bank, and looked down across the brook to the familiar low windowless walls and sharp-ridged roof of Keeper’s House; and when he came, at last, to the door, and pulled the latchstring, he heard the dogs inside⁠—the soft, coughing bark of Brave, and the anxious little whimper of Bold⁠—and he knew that there was nothing wrong in Keeper’s House.</p>
			<p>The room inside was lighted by a fist-sized chunk of lumicon, hung in a net bag of thongs from the rafter over the table. It was old⁠—cast off by some rich Southron as past its best brilliance, it had been old when he had bought it from Yorn Nazvik the Trader, and that had been years ago. Now its light was as dim and yellow as firelight. He’d have to replace it soon, but this trip he had needed new cartridges for the big rifle. A man could live in darkness more easily than he could live without cartridges.</p>
			<p>The big black dogs were rising from their bed of deerskins on the stone slab that covered the crypt in the far corner. They did not come to meet him, but stayed in their place of trust, greeting him with anxious, eager little sounds.</p>
			<p>“Good boys,” he said. “Good dog, Brave; good dog, Bold. Old Keeper’s home again. Hungry?”</p>
			<p>They recognized that word, and whined. He hung up the ice-staff on the pegs by the door, then squatted and got his arms out of the pack-straps.</p>
			<p>“Just a little now; wait a little,” he told the dogs. “Keeper’ll get something for you.”</p>
			<p>He unhooked the net bag that held the lumicon and went to the ladder, climbing to the loft between the stone ceiling and the steep snow-shed roof; he cut down two big chunks of smoked wild-ox beef⁠—the dogs liked that better than smoked venison⁠—and climbed down.</p>
			<p>He tossed one chunk up against the ceiling, at the same time shouting: “Bold! Catch!” Bold leaped forward, sinking his teeth into the meat as it was still falling, shaking and mauling it. Brave, still on the crypt-slab, was quivering with hunger and eagerness, but he remained in place until the second chunk was tossed and he was ordered to take it. Then he, too, leaped and caught it, savaging it in mimicry of a kill. For a while, he stood watching them growl and snarl and tear their meat, great beasts whose shoulders came above his own waist. While they lived to guard it, the Crown was safe. Then he crossed to the hearth, scraped away the covering ashes, piled on kindling and logs and fanned the fire alight. He lifted the pack to the table and unlaced the deerskin cover.</p>
			<p>Cartridges in plastic boxes of twenty, long and thick; shot for the duck-gun, and powder and lead and cartridge-primers; fills for the firelighter; salt; needles; a new file. And the deerskin bag of trade-tokens. He emptied them on the table and counted them⁠—tokens, and half-tokens and five-tokens, and even one ten-token. There were always less in the bag, after each trip to the village. The Southrons paid less and less, each year, for furs and skins, and asked more and more for what they had to sell.</p>
			<p>He put away the things he had brought from the village, and was considering whether to open the crypt now and replace the bag of tokens, when the dogs stiffened, looking at the door. They got to their feet, neck-hairs bristling, as the knocking began.</p>
			<p>He tossed the token-bag onto the mantel and went to the door, the dogs following and standing ready as he opened it.</p>
			<p>The snow had started, and now the ground was white except under the evergreens. Three men stood outside the door, and over their shoulders he could see an airboat grounded in the clearing in front of the house.</p>
			<p>“You are honored, Raud Keeper,” one of them began. “Here are strangers who have come to talk to you. Strangers from the Stars!”</p>
			<p>He recognized the speaker, in sealskin boots and deerskin trousers and hooded overshirt like his own⁠—Vahr Farg’s son, one of the village people. His father was dead, and his woman was the daughter of Gorth Sledmaker, and he was a house-dweller with his woman’s father. A worthless youth, lazy and stupid and said to be a coward. Still, guests were guests, even when brought by the likes of Vahr Farg’s son. He looked again at the airboat, and remembered seeing it, that day, made fast to the top-deck of Yorn Nazvik’s trading-ship, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Issa</i>.</p>
			<p>“Enter and be welcome; the house is yours, and all in it that is mine to give.” He turned to the dogs. “Brave, Bold; go watch.”</p>
			<p>Obediently, they trotted over to the crypt and lay down. He stood aside; Vahr entered, standing aside also, as though he were the host, inviting his companions in. They wore heavy garments of woven cloth and boots of tanned leather with hard heels and stiff soles, and as they came in, each unbuckled and laid aside a belt with a holstered negatron pistol. One was stocky and broad-shouldered, with red hair; the other was slender, dark haired and dark eyed, with a face as smooth as a woman’s. Everybody in the village had wondered about them. They were not of Yorn Nazvik’s crew, but passengers on the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Issa</i>.</p>
			<p>“These are Empire people, from the Far Stars,” Vahr informed him, naming their names. Long names, which meant nothing; certainly they were not names the Southrons from the Warm Seas bore. “And this is Raud the Keeper, with whom your honors wish to speak.”</p>
			<p>“Keeper’s House is honored. I’m sorry that I have not food prepared; if you can excuse me while I make some ready.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“You think these noblemen from the Stars would eat your swill?” Vahr hooted. “Crazy old fool, these are⁠—”</p>
			<p>The slim man pivoted on his heel; his open hand caught Vahr just below the ear and knocked him sprawling. It must have been some kind of trick-blow. That or else the slim stranger was stronger than he looked.</p>
			<p>“Hold your miserable tongue!” he told Vahr, who was getting to his feet. “We’re guests of Raud the Keeper, and we’ll not have him insulted in his own house by a cur like you!”</p>
			<p>The man with red hair turned. “I am ashamed. We should not have brought this into your house; we should have left it outside.” He spoke the Northland language well, “It will honor us to share your food, Keeper.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, and see here,” the younger man said, “we didn’t know you’d be alone. Let us help you. Dranigo’s a fine cook, and I’m not bad, myself.”</p>
			<p>He started to protest, then let them have their way. After all, a guest’s women helped the woman of the house, and as there was no woman in Keeper’s House, it was not unfitting for them to help him.</p>
			<p>“Your friend’s name is Dranigo?” he asked. “I’m sorry, but I didn’t catch yours.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t wonder; fool mouthed it so badly I couldn’t understand it myself. It’s Salvadro.”</p>
			<p>They fell to work with him, laying out eating-tools⁠—there were just enough to go around⁠—and hunting for dishes, of which there were not. Salvadro saved that situation by going out and bringing some in from the airboat. He must have realized that the lumicon over the table was the only light beside the fire in the house, for he was carrying a globe of the luminous plastic with him when he came in, grumbling about how dark it had gotten outside. It was new and brilliant, and the light hurt Raud’s eyes, at first.</p>
			<p>“Are you truly from the Stars?” he asked, after the food was on the table and they had begun to eat. “Neither I nor any in the village have seen anybody from the Stars before.”</p>
			<p>The big man with the red hair nodded. “Yes. We are from Dremna.”</p>
			<p>Why, Dremna was the Great World, at the middle of everything! Dremna was the Empire. People from Dremna came to the cities of Awster and fabulous Antark as Southron traders from the Warm Seas came to the villages of the Northfolk. He stammered something about that.</p>
			<p>“Yes. You see, we.⁠ ⁠…” Dranigo began. “I don’t know the word for it, in your language, but we’re people whose work it is to learn things. Not from other people or from books, but new things, that nobody else knows. We came here to learn about the long-ago times on this world, like the great city that was here and is now mounds of stone and earth. Then, when we go back to Dremna, we will tell other people what we have found out.”</p>
			<p>Vahr Farg’s son, having eaten his fill, was fidgeting on his stool, looking contemptuously at the strangers and their host. He thought they were fools to waste time learning about people who had died long ago. So he thought the Keeper was a fool, to guard a worthless old piece of junk.</p>
			<p>Raud hesitated for a moment, then said: “I have a very ancient thing, here in this house. It was worn, long ago, by great kings. Their names, and the name of their people, are lost, but the Crown remains. It was left to me as a trust by my father, who was Keeper before me and to whom it was left by his father, who was Keeper in his time. Have you heard of it?”</p>
			<p>Dranigo nodded. “We heard of it, first of all, on Dremna,” he said. “The Empire has a Space Navy base, and observatories and relay stations, on this planet. Space Navy officers who had been here brought the story back; they heard it from traders from the Warm Seas, who must have gotten it from people like Yorn Nazvik. Would you show it to us, Keeper? It was to see the Crown that we came here.”</p>
			<p>Raud got to his feet, and saw, as he unhooked the lumicon, that he was trembling. “Yes, of course. It is an honor. It is an ancient and wonderful thing, but I never thought that it was known on Dremna.” He hastened across to the crypt.</p>
			<p>The dogs looked up as he approached. They knew that he wanted to lift the cover, but they were comfortable and had to be coaxed to leave it. He laid aside the deerskins. The stone slab was heavy, and he had to strain to tilt it up. He leaned it against the wall, then picked up the lumicon and went down the steps into the little room below, opening the wooden chest and getting out the bundle wrapped in bearskin. He brought it up again and carried it to the table, from which Dranigo and Salvadro were clearing the dishes.</p>
			<p>“Here it is,” he said, untying the thongs. “I do not know how old it is. It was old even before the Ice-Father was born.”</p>
			<p>That was too much for Vahr. “See, I told you he’s crazy!” he cried. “The Ice-Father has been here forever. Gorth Sledmaker says so,” he added, as though that settled it.</p>
			<p>“Gorth Sledmaker’s a fool. He thinks the world began in the time of his grandfather.” He had the thongs untied, and spread the bearskin, revealing the blackened leather box, flat on the bottom and domed at the top. “How long ago do you think it was that the Ice-Father was born?” he asked Salvadro and Dranigo.</p>
			<p>“Not more than two thousand years,” Dranigo said. “The glaciation hadn’t started in the time of the Third Empire. There is no record of this planet during the Fourth, but by the beginning of the Fifth Empire, less than a thousand years ago, things here were very much as they are now.”</p>
			<p>“There are other worlds which have Ice-Fathers,” Salvadro explained. “They are all worlds having one pole or the other in open water, surrounded by land. When the polar sea is warmed by water from the tropics, snow falls on the lands around, and more falls in winter than melts in summer, and so is an Ice-Father formed. Then, when the polar sea is all frozen, no more snow falls, and the Ice-Father melts faster than it grows, and finally vanishes. And then, when warm water comes into the polar sea again, more snow falls, and it starts over again. On a world like this, it takes fifteen or twenty thousand years from one Ice-Father to the next.”</p>
			<p>“I never heard that there had been another Ice-Father, before this one. But then, I only know the stories told by the old men, when I was a boy. I suppose that was before the first people came in starships to this world.”</p>
			<p>The two men of Dremna looked at one another oddly, and he wondered, as he unfastened the brass catches on the box, if he had said something foolish, and then he had the box open, and lifted out the Crown. He was glad, now, that Salvadro had brought in the new lumicon, as he put the box aside and set the Crown on the black bearskin. The golden circlet and the four arches of gold above it were clean and bright, and the jewels were splendid in the light. Salvadro and Dranigo were looking at it wide-eyed. Vahr Farg’s son was open-mouthed.</p>
			<p>“Great Universe! Will you look at that diamond on the top!” Salvadro was saying.</p>
			<p>“That’s not the work of any Galactic art-period,” Dranigo declared. “That thing goes back to the Pre-Interstellar Era.” And for a while he talked excitedly to Salvadro.</p>
			<p>“Tell me, Keeper,” Salvadro said at length, “how much do you know about the Crown? Where did it come from; who made it; who were the first Keepers?”</p>
			<p>He shook his head. “I only know what my father told me, when I was a boy. Now I am an old man, and some things I have forgotten. But my father was Runch, Raud’s son, who was the son of Yorn, the son of Raud, the son of Runch.” He went back six more generations, then faltered and stopped. “Beyond that, the names have been lost. But I do know that for a long time the Crown was in a city to the north of here, and before that it was brought across the sea from another country, and the name of that country was Brinn.”</p>
			<p>Dranigo frowned, as though he had never heard the name before. “Brinn.” Salvadro’s eyes widened. “Brinn, Dranigo! Do you think that might be Britain?”</p>
			<p>Dranigo straightened, staring, “It might be! Britain was a great nation, once; the last nation to join the Terran Federation, in the Third Century Pre-Interstellar. And they had a king, and a crown with a great diamond.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>“The story of where it was made,” Raud offered, “or who made it, has been lost. I suppose the first people brought it to this world when they came in starships.”</p>
			<p>“It’s more wonderful than that, Keeper,” Salvadro said. “It was made on this world, before the first starship was built. This world is Terra, the Mother-World; didn’t you know that, Keeper? This is the world where Man was born.”</p>
			<p>He hadn’t known that. Of course, there had to be a world like that, but a great world in the middle of everything, like Dremna. Not this old, forgotten world.</p>
			<p>“It’s true, Keeper,” Dranigo told him. He hesitated slightly, then cleared his throat. “Keeper, you’re young no longer, and some day you must die, as your father and his father did. Who will care for the Crown then?”</p>
			<p>Who, indeed? His woman had died long ago, and she had given him no sons, and the daughters she had given him had gone their own ways with men of their own choosing and he didn’t know what had become of any of them. And the village people⁠—they would start picking the Crown apart to sell the jewels, one by one, before the ashes of his pyre stopped smoking.</p>
			<p>“Let us have it, Keeper,” Salvadro said. “We will take it to Dremna, where armed men will guard it day and night, and it will be a trust upon the Government of the Empire forever.”</p>
			<p>He recoiled in horror. “Man! You don’t know what you’re saying!” he cried. “This is the Crown, and I am the Keeper; I cannot part with it as long as there is life in me.”</p>
			<p>“And when there is not, what? Will it be laid on your pyre, so that it may end with you?” Dranigo asked.</p>
			<p>“Do you think we’d throw it away as soon as we got tired looking at it?” Salvadro exclaimed. “To show you how we’ll value this, we’ll give you⁠ ⁠… how much is a thousand imperials in trade-tokens, Dranigo?”</p>
			<p>“I’d guess about twenty thousand.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll give you twenty thousand Government trade-tokens,” Salvadro said. “If it costs us that much, you’ll believe that we’ll take care of it, won’t you?”</p>
			<p>Raud rose stiffly. “It is a wrong thing,” he said, “to enter a man’s house and eat at his table, and then insult him.”</p>
			<p>Dranigo rose also, and Salvadro with him. “We had no mind to insult you, Keeper, or offer you a bribe to betray your trust. We only offer to help you fulfill it, so that the Crown will be safe after all of us are dead. Well, we won’t talk any more about it, now. We’re going in Yorn Nazvik’s ship, tomorrow; he’s trading in the country to the west, but before he returns to the Warm Seas, he’ll stop at Long Valley Town, and we’ll fly over to see you. In the meantime, think about this; ask yourself if you would not be doing a better thing for the Crown by selling it to us.”</p>
			<p>They wanted to leave the dishes and the new lumicon, and he permitted it, to show that he was not offended by their offer to buy the Crown. He knew that it was something very important to them, and he admitted, grudgingly, that they could care for it better than he. At least, they would not keep it in a hole under a hut in the wilderness, guarded only by dogs. But they were not Keepers, and he was. To them, the Crown would be but one of many important things; to him it was everything. He could not imagine life without it.</p>
			<p>He lay for a long time among his bed-robes, unable to sleep, thinking of the Crown and the visitors. Finally, to escape those thoughts, he began planning tomorrow morning’s hunt.</p>
			<p>He would start out as soon as the snow stopped, and go down among the scrub-pines; he would take Brave with him, and leave Bold on guard at home. Brave was more obedient, and a better hunter. Bold would jump for the deer that had been shot, but Brave always tried to catch or turn the ones that were still running.</p>
			<p>He needed meat badly, and he needed more deerskins, to make new clothes. He was thinking of the new overshirt he meant to make as he fell asleep.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>It was past noon when he and Brave turned back toward Keeper’s House. The deer had gone farther than he had expected, but he had found them, and killed four. The carcasses were cleaned and hung from trees, out of reach of the foxes and the wolves, and he would take Brave back to the house and leave him on guard, and return with Bold and the sled to bring in the meat. He was thinking cheerfully of the fresh meat when he came out onto the path from the village, a mile from Keeper’s House. Then he stopped short, looking at the tracks.</p>
			<p>Three men⁠—no, four⁠—had come from the direction of the village since the snow had stopped. One had been wearing sealskin boots, of the sort worn by all Northfolk. The others had worn Southron boots, with ribbed plastic soles. That puzzled him. None of the village people wore Southron boots, and as he had been leaving in the early morning, he had seen Yorn Nazvik’s ship, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Issa</i>, lift out from the village and pass overhead, vanishing in the west. Possibly these were deserters. In any case, they were not good people. He slipped the heavy rifle from its snow-cover, checked the chamber, and hung the empty cover around his neck like a scarf. He didn’t like the looks of it.</p>
			<p>He liked it even less when he saw that the man in sealskin boots had stopped to examine the tracks he and Brave had made on leaving, and had then circled the house and come back, to be joined by his plastic-soled companions. Then they had all put down their packs and their ice-staffs, and advanced toward the door of the house. They had stopped there for a moment, and then they had entered, come out again, gotten their packs and ice-staffs, and gone away, up the slope to the north.</p>
			<p>“Wait, Brave,” he said. “Watch.”</p>
			<p>Then he advanced, careful not to step on any of the tracks until he reached the doorstep, where it could not be avoided.</p>
			<p>“Bold!” he called loudly. “Bold!”</p>
			<p>Silence. No welcoming whimper, no padding of feet, inside. He pulled the latchstring with his left hand and pushed the door open with his foot, the rifle ready. There was no need for that. What welcomed him, within, was a sickening stench of burned flesh and hair.</p>
			<p>The new lumicon lighted the room brilliantly; his first glance was enough. The slab that had covered the crypt was thrown aside, along with the pile of deerskins, and between it and the door was a shapeless black heap that, in a dimmer light, would not have been instantly recognizable as the body of Bold. Fighting down an impulse to rush in, he stood in the door, looking about and reading the story of what had happened. The four men had entered, knowing that they would find Bold alone. The one in the lead had had a negatron pistol drawn, and when Bold had leaped at them, he had been blasted. The blast had caught the dog from in front⁠—the chest-cavity was literally exploded, and the neck and head burned and smashed unrecognizably. Even the brass studs on the leather collar had been melted.</p>
			<p>That and the ribbed sole-prints outside meant the same thing⁠—Southrons. Every Southron who came into the Northland, even the common crewmen on the trading ships, carried some kind of an energy-weapon. They were good only for fighting⁠—one look at the body of Bold showed what they did to meat and skins.</p>
			<p>He entered, then, laying his rifle on the table, and got down the lumicon and went over to the crypt. After a while, he returned, hung up the light again, and dropped onto a stool. He sat staring at the violated crypt and tugging with one hand at a corner of his beard, trying desperately to think.</p>
			<p>The thieves had known exactly where the Crown was kept and how it was guarded; after killing Bold, they had gone straight to it, taken it and gone away⁠—three men in plastic-soled Southron boots and one man in soft boots of sealskins, each with a pack and an ice-staff, and two of them with rifles.</p>
			<p>Vahr Farg’s son, and three deserters from the crew of Yorn Nazvik’s ship.</p>
			<p>It hadn’t been Dranigo and Salvadro. They could have left the ship in their airboat and come back, flying low, while he had been hunting. But they would have grounded near the house, they would not have carried packs, and they would have brought nobody with them.</p>
			<p>He thought he knew what had happened. Vahr Farg’s son had seen the Crown, and he had heard the two Starfolk offer more trade-tokens for it than everything in the village was worth. But he was a coward; he would never dare to face the Keeper’s rifle and the teeth of Brave and Bold alone. So, since none of the village folk would have part in so shameful a crime against the moral code of the Northland, he had talked three of Yorn Nazvik’s airmen into deserting and joining him.</p>
			<p>And he had heard Dranigo say that the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Issa</i> would return to Long Valley Town after the trading voyage to the west. Long Valley was on the other side of this tongue of the Ice-Father; it was a good fifteen days’ foot-journey around, but by climbing and crossing, they could easily be there in time to meet Yorn Nazvik’s ship and the two Starfolk. Well, where Vahr Farg’s son could take three Southrons, Raud the Keeper could follow.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Their tracks led up the slope beside the brook, always bearing to the left, in the direction of the Ice-Father. After an hour, he found where they had stopped and unslung their packs, and rested long enough to smoke a cigarette. He read the story they had left in the snow, and then continued, Brave trotting behind him pulling the sled. A few snowflakes began dancing in the air, and he quickened his steps. He knew, generally, where the thieves were going, but he wanted their tracks unobliterated in front of him. The snow fell thicker and thicker, and it was growing dark, and he was tiring. Even Brave was stumbling occasionally before Raud stopped, in a hollow among the pines, to build his tiny fire and eat and feed the dog. They bedded down together, covered by the same sleeping robes.</p>
			<p>When he woke, the world was still black and white and gray in the early dawn-light, and the robe that covered him and Brave was powdered with snow, and the pine-branches above him were loaded and sagging.</p>
			<p>The snow had completely obliterated the tracks of the four thieves, and it was still falling. When the sled was packed and the dog harnessed to it, they set out, keeping close to the flank of the Ice-Father on their left.</p>
			<p>It stopped snowing toward midday, and a little after, he heard a shot, far ahead, and then two more, one upon the other. The first shot would be the rifle of Vahr Farg’s son; it was a single-loader, like his own. The other two were from one of the light Southron rifles, which fired a dozen shots one after another. They had shot, or shot at, something like a deer, he supposed. That was sensible; it would save their dried meat for the trip across the back of the Ice-Father. And it showed that they still didn’t know he was following them. He found their tracks, some hours later.</p>
			<p>Toward dusk, he came to a steep building-mound. It had fared better than most of the houses of the ancient people; it rose to twenty times a man’s height and on the southeast side it was almost perpendicular. The other side sloped, and he was able to climb to the top, and far away, ahead of him, he saw a tiny spark appear and grow. The fire could not be more than two hours ahead.</p>
			<p>He built no fire that evening, but shared a slab of pemmican with Brave, and they huddled together under the bearskin robe. The dog fell asleep at once. For a long time, Raud sat awake, thinking.</p>
			<p>At first, he considered resting for a while, and then pressing forward and attacking them as they slept. He had to kill all of them to regain the Crown; that he had taken for granted from the first. He knew what would happen if the Government Police came into this. They would take one Southron’s word against the word of ten Northfolk, and the thieves would simply claim the Crown as theirs and accuse him of trying to steal it. And Dranigo and Salvadro⁠—they seemed like good men, but they might see this as the only way to get the Crown for themselves.⁠ ⁠… He would have to settle the affair for himself, before the men reached Long Valley town.</p>
			<p>If he could do it here, it would save him and Brave the toil and danger of climbing the Ice-Father. But could he? They had two rifles, one an autoloader, and they had in all likelihood three negatron pistols. After the single shot of the big rifle was fired, he had only a knife and a hatchet and the spiked and pickaxed ice-staff, and Brave. One of the thieves would kill him before he and Brave killed all of them, and then the Crown would be lost. He dropped into sleep, still thinking of what to do.</p>
			<p>He climbed the mound of the ancient building again in the morning, and looked long and carefully at the face of the Ice-Father. It would take the thieves the whole day to reach that place where the two tongues of the glacier split apart, the easiest spot to climb. They would not try to climb that evening; Vahr, who knew the most about it, would be the last to advise such a risk. He was sure that by going up at the nearest point he could get to the top of the Ice-Father before dark, and drag Brave up after him. It would be a fearful climb, and he would have most of a day’s journey after that to reach the head of the long ravine up which the thieves would come, but when they came up, he could be there waiting for them. He knew what the old rifle could do, to an inch, and there were places where the thieves would be coming up where he could stay out of blaster-range and pick them all off, even with a single-loader.</p>
			<p>He knew about negatron pistols, too. They shot little bullets of energy; they were very fast, and did not drop, like a real bullet, so that no judgment of range was needed. But the energy died quickly; the negatrons lived only long enough to go five hundred paces and no more. At eight hundred, he could hit a man easily. He almost felt himself pitying Vahr Farg’s son and his companions.</p>
			<p>When he reached the tumble of rocks that had been dragged along with and pushed out from the Ice-Father, he stopped and made up a pack⁠—sleeping robes, all his cartridges, as much pemmican as he could carry, and the bag of trade-tokens. If the chase took him to Long Valley Town, he would need money. He also coiled about his waist a long rawhide climbing-rope, and left the sled-harness on Brave, simply detaching the traces.</p>
			<p>At first, they walked easily on the sloping ice. Then, as it grew steeper, he fastened the rope to the dog’s harness and advanced a little at a time, dragging Brave up after him. Soon he was forced to snub the rope with his ice-staff and chop steps with his hatchet. Toward noon⁠—at least he thought it was noon⁠—it began snowing again, and the valley below was blotted out in a swirl of white.</p>
			<p>They came to a narrow ledge, where they could rest, with a wall of ice rising sheerly above them. He would have to climb that alone, and then pull Brave up with the rope. He started working his way up the perpendicular face, clinging by the pick of his ice-staff, chopping footholds with the hatchet; the pack and the slung rifle on his back pulled at him and threatened to drag him down. At length, he dragged himself over the edge and drove the ice-staff in.</p>
			<p>“Up, Brave!” he called, tugging on the rope. “Good dog, Brave; come up!”</p>
			<p>Brave tried to jump and slipped back. He tried again, and this time Raud snubbed the rope and held him. Below the dog pawed frantically, until he found a paw-hold on one of the chopped-out steps. Raud hauled on the rope, and made another snub.</p>
			<p>It seemed like hours. It probably was; his arms were aching, and he had lost all sense of time, or of the cold, or the danger of the narrow ledge; he forgot about the Crown and the men who had stolen it; he even forgot how he had come here, or that he had ever been anywhere else. All that mattered was to get Brave up on the ledge beside him.</p>
			<p>Finally Brave came up and got first his forepaws and then his body over the edge. He lay still, panting proudly, while Raud hugged him and told him, over and over, that he was a good dog. They rested for a long time, and Raud got a slab of pemmican from the pack and divided it with Brave.</p>
			<p>It was while they rested in the snow, munching, that he heard the sound for the first time. It was faint and far away, and it sounded like thunder, or like an avalanche beginning, and that puzzled him, for this was not the time of year for either. As he listened, he heard it again, and this time he recognized it⁠—negatron pistols. It frightened him; he wondered if the thieves had met a band of hunters. No; if they were fighting Northfolk, there would be the reports of firearms, too. Or might they be fighting among themselves? Remembering the melted brass studs on Bold’s collar, he became more frightened at the thought of what a negatron-blast could do to the Crown.</p>
			<p>The noise stopped, then started again, and he got to his feet, calling to Brave. They were on a wide ledge that slanted upward toward the north. It would take him closer to the top, and closer to where Vahr and his companions would come up. Together, they started up, Raud probing cautiously ahead of him with the ice-staff for hidden crevasses. After a while, he came to a wide gap in the ice beside him, slanting toward the top, its upper end lost in swirling snow. So he and Brave began climbing, and after a while he could no longer hear the negatron pistols.</p>
			<p>When it was almost too dark to go farther, he suddenly found himself on level snow, and here he made camp, digging a hole and lining it with the sleeping robes.</p>
			<p>The sky was clear when he woke, and a pale yellow light was glowing in the east. For a while he lay huddled with the dog, stiff and miserable, and then he forced himself to his feet. He ate, and fed Brave, and then checked his rifle and made his pack.</p>
			<p>He was sure, now, that he had a plan that would succeed. He could reach the place where Vahr and the Southrons would come up long before they did, and be waiting for them. In his imagination, he could see them coming up in single file, Vahr Farg’s son in the lead, and he could imagine himself hidden behind a mound of snow, the ice-staff upright to brace his left hand and the forestock of the rifle resting on his outthrust thumb and the butt against his shoulder. The first bullet would be for Vahr. He could shoot all of them, one after another, that way.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>He stopped, looking in chagrined incredulity at the tracks in front of him⁠—the tracks he knew so well, of one man in sealskin boots and three men with ribbed plastic soles. Why, it couldn’t be! They should be no more than halfway up the long ravine, between the two tongues of the Ice-Father, ten miles to the north. But here they were, on the back of the Ice-Father and crossing to the west ahead of him. They must have climbed the sheer wall of ice, only a few miles from where he had dragged himself and Brave to the top. Then he remembered the negatron-blasts he had heard. While he had been chopping footholds with a hatchet, they had been smashing tons of ice out of their way.</p>
			<p>“Well, Brave,” he said mildly. “Old Keeper wasn’t so smart, after all, was he? Come on, Brave.”</p>
			<p>The thieves were making good time. He read that from the tracks⁠—straight, evenly spaced, no weary heel-dragging. Once or twice, he saw where they had stopped for a brief rest. He hoped to see their fire in the evening.</p>
			<p>He didn’t. They wouldn’t have enough fuel to make a big one, or keep it burning long. But in the morning, as he was breaking camp, he saw black smoke ahead.</p>
			<p>A few times, he had been in airboats, and had looked down on the back of the Ice-Father, and it had looked flat. Really, it was not. There were long ridges, sheer on one side and sloping gently on the other, where the ice had overridden hills and low mountains, or had cracked and one side had pushed up over the other. And there were deep gullies where the prevailing winds had scooped away loose snow year after year for centuries, and drifts where it had piled, many of them higher than the building-mounds of the ancient cities. But from a distance, as from above, they all blended into a featureless white monotony.</p>
			<p>At last, leaving a tangle of cliffs and ravines, he looked out across a broad stretch of nearly level snow and saw, for the first time, the men he was following. Four tiny dots, so far that they seemed motionless, strung out in single file. Instantly, he crouched behind a swell in the surface and dragged Brave down beside him. One of them, looking back, might see him, as he saw them. When they vanished behind a snow-hill, he rose and hastened forward, to take cover again. He kept at this all day; by alternately resting and running, be found himself gaining on them, and toward evening, he was within rifle-range. The man in the lead was Vahr Farg’s son; even at that distance he recognized him easily. The others were Southrons, of course; they wore quilted garments of cloth, and quilted hoods. The man next to Vahr, in blue, carried a rifle, as Vahr did. The man in yellow had only an ice-staff, and the man in green, at the rear, had the Crown on his pack, still in the bearskin bundle.</p>
			<p>He waited, at the end of the day, until he saw the light of their fire. Then he and Brave circled widely around their camp, and stopped behind a snow-ridge, on the other side of an open and level stretch a mile wide. He dug the sleeping-hole on the crest of the ridge, making it larger than usual, and piled up a snow breastwork in front of it, with an embrasure through which he could look or fire without being seen.</p>
			<p>Before daybreak, he was awake and had his pack made, and when he saw the smoke of the thieves’ campfire, he was lying behind his breastwork, the rifle resting on its folded cover, muzzle toward the smoke. He lay for a long time, watching, before he saw the file of tiny dots emerge into the open.</p>
			<p>They came forward steadily, in the same order as on the day before, Vahr in the lead and the man with the Crown in the rear. The thieves suspected nothing; they grew larger and larger as they approached, until they were at the range for which he had set his sights. He cuddled the butt of the rifle against his cheek. As the man who carried the Crown walked under the blade of the front sight, he squeezed the trigger.</p>
			<p>The rifle belched pink flame and roared and pounded his shoulder. As the muzzle was still rising, he flipped open the breech, and threw out the empty. He inserted a fresh round.</p>
			<p>There were only three of them, now. The man with the bearskin bundle was down and motionless. Vahr Farg’s son had gotten his rifle unslung and uncovered. The Southron with the other rifle was slower; he was only getting off the cover as Vahr, who must have seen the flash, fired hastily. Too hastily; the bullet kicked up snow twenty feet to the left. The third man had drawn his negatron pistol and was trying to use it; thin hairlines of brilliance were jetting out from his hand, stopping far short of their mark.</p>
			<p>Raud closed his sights on the man with the autoloading rifle; as he did, the man with the negatron pistol, realizing the limitations of his weapon, was sweeping it back and forth, aiming at the snow fifty yards in front of him. Raud couldn’t see the effect of his second shot⁠—between him and his target, blueish light blazed and twinkled, and dense clouds of steam rose⁠—but he felt sure that he had missed. He reloaded, and watched for movements on the edge of the rising steam.</p>
			<p>It cleared, slowly; when it did, there was nothing behind it. Even the body of the dead man was gone. He blinked, bewildered. He’d picked that place carefully; there had been no gully or ravine within running distance. Then he grunted. There hadn’t been⁠—but there was now. The negatron pistol again. The thieves were hidden in a pit they had blasted, and they had dragged the body in with them.</p>
			<p>He crawled back to reassure Brave, who was guarding the pack, and to shift the pack back for some distance. Then he returned to his embrasure in the snow-fort and resumed his watch. For a long time, nothing happened, and then a head came briefly peeping up out of the pit. A head under a green hood. Raud chuckled mirthlessly into his beard. If he’d been doing that, he’d have traded hoods with the dead man before shoving up his body to draw fire. This kept up, at intervals, for about an hour. He was wondering if they would stay in the pit until dark.</p>
			<p>Then Vahr Farg’s son leaped out of the pit and began running across the snow. He had his pack, and his rifle; he ran, zigzag, almost directly toward where Raud was lying. Raud laughed, this time in real amusement. The Southrons had chased Vahr out, as a buck will chase his does in front of him when he thinks there is danger in front. If Vahr wasn’t shot, it would be safe for them to come out. If he was, it would be no loss, and the price of the Crown would only have to be divided in two, rather than three, shares. Vahr came to within two hundred yards of Raud’s unseen rifle, and then dropped his pack and flung himself down behind it, covering the ridge with his rifle.</p>
			<p>Minutes passed, and then the Southron in yellow came out and ran forward. He had the bearskin bundle on his pack; he ran to where Vahr lay, added his pack to Vahr’s, and lay down behind it. Raud chewed his underlip in vexation. This wasn’t the way he wanted it; that fellow had a negatron pistol, and he was close enough to use it effectively. And he was sheltered behind the Crown; Raud was afraid to shoot. He didn’t miss what he shot at⁠—often. But no man alive could say that he never missed.</p>
			<p>The other Southron, the one in blue with the autoloading rifle, came out and advanced slowly, his weapon at the ready. Raud tensed himself to jump, aimed carefully, and waited. When the man in blue was a hundred yards from the pit, he shot him dead. The rifle was still lifting from the recoil when he sprang to his feet, turned, and ran. Before he was twenty feet away, the place where he had been exploded; the force of the blast almost knocked him down, and steam blew past and ahead of him. Ignoring his pack and ice-staff, he ran on, calling to Brave to follow. The dog obeyed instantly; more negatron-blasts were thundering and blazing and steaming on the crest of the ridge. He swerved left, ran up another slope, and slid down the declivity beyond into the ravine on the other side.</p>
			<p>There he paused to eject the empty, make sure that there was no snow in the rifle bore, and reload. The blasting had stopped by then; after a moment, he heard the voice of Vahr Farg’s son, and guessed that the two surviving thieves had advanced to the blasted crest of the other ridge. They’d find the pack, and his tracks and Brave’s. He wondered whether they’d come hunting for him, or turn around and go the other way. He knew what he’d do, under the circumstances, but he doubted if Vahr’s mind would work that way. The Southron’s might; he wouldn’t want to be caught between blaster-range and rifle-range of Raud the Keeper again.</p>
			<p>“Come, Brave,” he whispered, looking quickly around and then starting to run.</p>
			<p>Lay a trail down this ravine for them to follow. Then get to the top of the ridge beside it, double back, and wait for them. Let them pass, and shoot the Southron first. By now, Vahr would have a negatron pistol too, taken from the body of the man in blue, but it wasn’t a weapon he was accustomed to, and he’d be more than a little afraid of it.</p>
			<p>The ravine ended against an upthrust face of ice, at right angles to the ridge he had just crossed; there was a V-shaped notch between them. He turned into this; it would be a good place to get to the top.⁠ ⁠…</p>
			<p>He found himself face to face, at fifteen feet, with Vahr Farg’s son and the Southron in yellow, coming through from the other side. They had their packs, the Southron had the bearskin bundle, and they had drawn negatron pistols in their hands.</p>
			<p>Swinging up the rifle, he shot the Southron in the chest, making sure he hit him low enough to miss the Crown. At the same time, he shouted:</p>
			<p>“<em>Catch, Brave!</em>”</p>
			<p>Brave never jumped for the deer or wild-ox that had been shot; always for the one still on its feet. He launched himself straight at the throat of Vahr Farg’s son⁠—and into the muzzle of Vahr’s blaster. He died in a blue-white flash.</p>
			<p>Raud had reversed the heavy rifle as Brave leaped; he threw it, butt-on, like a seal-spear, into Vahr’s face. As soon as it was out of his fingers, he was jumping forward, snatching out his knife. His left hand found Vahr’s right wrist, and he knew that he was driving the knife into Vahr’s body, over and over, trying to keep the blaster pointed away from him and away from the body of the dead Southron. At last, the negatron-pistol fell from Vahr’s fingers, and the arm that had been trying to fend off his knife relaxed.</p>
			<p>He straightened and tried to stand⁠—he had been kneeling on Vahr’s body, he found⁠—and reeled giddily. He got to his feet and stumbled to the other body, kneeling beside it. He tried for a long time before he was able to detach the bearskin bundle from the dead man’s pack. Then he got the pack open, and found dried venison. He started to divide it, and realized that there was no Brave with whom to share it. He had just sent Brave to his death.</p>
			<p>Well, and so? Brave had been the Keeper’s dog. He had died for the Crown, and that had been his duty. If he could have saved the Crown by giving his own life, Raud would have died too. But he could not⁠—if Raud died the Crown was lost.</p>
			<p>The sky was darkening rapidly, and the snow was whitening the body in green. Moving slowly, he started to make camp for the night.</p>
			<p>It was still snowing when he woke. He started to rise, wondering, at first, where Brave was, and then he huddled back among the robes⁠—his own and the dead men’s⁠—and tried to go to sleep again. Finally, he got up and ate some of his pemmican, gathered his gear and broke camp. For a moment, and only a moment, he stood looking to the east, in the direction he had come from. Then he turned west and started across the snow toward the edge of the Ice-Father.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The snow stopped before he reached the edge, and the sun was shining when he found a slanting way down into the valley. Then, out of the north, a black dot appeared in the sky and grew larger, until he saw that it was a Government airboat⁠—one of the kind used by the men who measured the growth of the Ice-Father. It came curving in and down toward him, and a window slid open and a man put his head out.</p>
			<p>“Want us to lift you down?” he asked. “We’re going to Long Valley Town. If that’s where you’re going, we can take you the whole way.”</p>
			<p>“Yes. That’s where I’m going.” He said it as though he were revealing, for the first time, some discovery he had just made. “For your kindness and help, I thank you.”</p>
			<p>In less time than a man could walk two miles with a pack, they were letting down in front of the Government House in Long Valley Town.</p>
			<p>He had never been in the Government House before. The walls were clear glass. The floors were plastic, clean and white. Strips of bright new lumicon ran around every room at the tops of all the walls. There were no fires, but the great rooms were as warm as though it were a midsummer afternoon.</p>
			<p>Still carrying his pack and his rifle, Raud went to a desk where a Southron in a white shirt sat.</p>
			<p>“Has Yorn Nazvik’s ship, the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Issa</i>, been here lately?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“About six days ago,” the Southron said, without looking up from the papers on his desk. “She’s on a trading voyage to the west now, but Nazvik’s coming back here before he goes south. Be here in about ten days.” He looked up. “You have business with Nazvik?”</p>
			<p>Raud shook his head. “Not with Yorn Nazvik, no. My business is with the two Starfolk who are passengers with him. Dranigo and Salvadro.”</p>
			<p>The Southron looked displeased. “Aren’t you getting just a little above yourself, old man, calling the Prince Salsavadran and the Lord Dranigrastan by their familiar names?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about. Those were the names they gave me; I didn’t know they had any others.”</p>
			<p>The Southron started to laugh, then stopped.</p>
			<p>“And if I may ask, what is your name, and what business have you with them?” he inquired.</p>
			<p>Raud told him his name. “I have something for them. Something they want very badly. If I can find a place to stay here, I will wait until they return⁠—”</p>
			<p>The Southron got to his feet. “Wait here for a moment, Keeper,” he said. “I’ll be back soon.”</p>
			<p>He left the desk, going into another room. After a while, he came back. This time he was respectful.</p>
			<p>“I was talking to the Lord Dranigrastan⁠—whom you know as Dranigo⁠—on the radio. He and the Prince Salsavadran are lifting clear of the <i epub:type="se:name.vessel.ship">Issa</i> in their airboat and coming back here to see you. They should be here in about three hours. If, in the meantime, you wish to bathe and rest, I’ll find you a room. And I suppose you’ll want something to eat, too.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He was waiting at the front of the office, looking out the glass wall, when the airboat came in and grounded, and Salvadro and Dranigo jumped out and came hurrying up the walk to the doorway.</p>
			<p>“Well, here you are, Keeper,” Dranigo greeted him, clasping his hand. Then he saw the bearskin bundle under Raud’s arm. “You brought it with you? But didn’t you believe that we were coming?”</p>
			<p>“Are you going to let us have it?” Salvadro was asking.</p>
			<p>“Yes; I will sell it to you, for the price you offered. I am not fit to be Keeper any longer. I lost it. It was stolen from me, the day after I saw you, and I have only yesterday gotten it back. Both my dogs were killed, too. I can no longer keep it safe. Better that you take it with you to Dremna, away from this world where it was made. I have thought, before, that this world and I are both old and good for nothing any more.”</p>
			<p>“This world may be old, Keeper,” Dranigo said, “but it is the Mother-World, Terra, the world that sent Man to the Stars. And you⁠—when you lost the Crown, you recovered it again.”</p>
			<p>“The next time, I won’t be able to. Too many people will know that the Crown is worth stealing, and the next time, they’ll kill me first.”</p>
			<p>“Well, we said we’d give you twenty thousand trade-tokens for it,” Salvadro said. “We’ll have them for you as soon as we can draw them from the Government bank, here. Or give you a check and let you draw them as you want them.” Raud didn’t understand that, and Salvadro didn’t try to explain. “And then we’ll fly you home.”</p>
			<p>He shook his head. “No, I have no home. The place where you saw me is Keeper’s House, and I am not the Keeper any more. I will stay here and find a place to live, and pay somebody to take care of me.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
			<p>With twenty thousand trade-tokens, he could do that. It would buy a house in which he could live, and he could find some woman who had lost her man, who would do his work for him. But he must be careful of the money. Dig a crypt in the corner of his house for it. He wondered if he could find a pair of good dogs and train them to guard it for him.⁠ ⁠…</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Mercenaries</h2>
			<p>Duncan MacLeod hung up the suit he had taken off, and sealed his shirt, socks and underwear in a laundry envelope bearing his name and identity-number, tossing this into one of the wire baskets provided for the purpose. Then, naked except for the plastic identity disk around his neck, he went over to the desk, turned in his locker key, and passed into the big room beyond.</p>
			<p>Four or five young men, probably soldiers on their way to town, were coming through from the other side. Like MacLeod, they wore only the plastic disks they had received in exchange for the metal ones they wore inside the reservation, and they were being searched by attendants who combed through their hair, probed into ears and nostrils, peered into mouths with tiny searchlights, and employed a variety of magnetic and electronic detectors.</p>
			<p>To this search MacLeod submitted wearily. He had become quite a connoisseur of security measures in fifteen years’ research and development work for a dozen different nations, but the Tonto Basin Research Establishment of the Philadelphia Project exceeded anything he had seen before. There were gray-haired veterans of the old Manhattan Project here, men who had worked with Fermi at Chicago, or with Oppenheimer at Los Alamos, twenty years before, and they swore in amused exasperation when they thought of how the relatively mild regulations of those days had irked them. And yet, the very existence of the Manhattan Project had been kept a secret from all but those engaged in it, and its purpose from most of them. Today, in 1965, there might have been a few wandering tribesmen in Somaliland or the Kirghiz Steppes who had never heard of the Western Union’s Philadelphia Project, or of the Fourth Komintern’s Red Triumph Five-Year Plan, or of the Islamic Kaliphate’s al-Borak Undertaking, or of the Ibero-American Confederation’s Cavor Project, but every literate person in the world knew that the four great power-blocs were racing desperately to launch the first spaceship to reach the Moon and build the Lunar fortress that would insure world supremacy.</p>
			<p>He turned in the nonmagnetic identity disk at the desk on the other side of the search room, receiving the metal one he wore inside the reservation, and with it the key to his inside locker. He put on the clothes he had left behind when he had passed out, and filled his pockets with the miscellany of small articles he had not been allowed to carry off the reservation. He knotted the garish necktie affected by the civilian workers and in particular by members of the MacLeod Research Team to advertise their nonmilitary status, lit his pipe, and walked out into the open gallery beyond.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Karen Hilquist was waiting for him there, reclining in one of the metal chairs. She looked cool in the belted white coveralls, with the white turban bound around her yellow hair, and very beautiful, and when he saw her, his heart gave a little bump, like a geiger responding to an ionizing particle. It always did that, although they had been together for twelve years, and married for ten. Then she saw him and smiled, and he came over, fanning himself with his sun helmet, and dropped into a chair beside her.</p>
			<p>“Did you call our center for a jeep?” he asked. When she nodded, he continued: “I thought you would, so I didn’t bother.”</p>
			<p>For a while, they sat silent, looking with bored distaste at the swarm of steel-helmeted Army riflemen and tommy-gunners guarding the transfer platforms and the vehicles gate. A string of trucks had been passed under heavy guard into the clearance compound: they were now unloading supplies onto a platform, at the other side of which other trucks were backed waiting to receive the shipment. A hundred feet of bare concrete and fifty armed soldiers separated these from the men and trucks from the outside, preventing contact.</p>
			<p>“And still they can’t stop leaks,” Karen said softly. “And we get blamed for it.”</p>
			<p>MacLeod nodded and started to say something, when his attention was drawn by a commotion on the driveway. A big Tucker limousine with an <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">O.D.</abbr> paint job and the single-starred flag of a brigadier general was approaching, horning impatiently. In the back seat MacLeod could see a heavy-shouldered figure with the face of a bad-tempered great Dane⁠—General Daniel Nayland, the military commander of Tonto Basin. The inside guards jumped to attention and saluted; the barrier shot up as though rocket-propelled, and the car slid through; the barrier slammed down behind it. On the other side, the guards were hurling themselves into a frenzy of saluting. Karen made a face after the receding car and muttered something in Hindustani. She probably didn’t know the literal meaning of what she had called General Nayland, but she understood that it was a term of extreme opprobrium.</p>
			<p>Her husband contributed: “His idea of Heaven would be a huge research establishment, where he’d be a five-star general, and Galileo, Newton, Priestley, Dalton, Maxwell, Planck and Einstein would be tech sergeants.”</p>
			<p>“And Marie Curie and Lise Meitner would be Wac corporals,” Karen added. “He really hates all of us, doesn’t he?”</p>
			<p>“He hates our Team,” MacLeod replied. “In the first place, we’re a lot of civilians, who aren’t subject to his regulations and don’t have to salute him. We’re working under contract with the Western Union, not with the United States Government, and as the United States participates in the Western Union on a treaty basis, our contract has the force of a treaty obligation. It gives us what amounts to extraterritoriality, like Europeans in China during the Nineteenth Century. So we have our own transport, for which he must furnish petrol, and our own armed guard, and we fly our own flag over Team Center, and that gripes him as much as anything else. That and the fact that we’re foreigners. So wouldn’t he love to make this espionage rap stick on us!”</p>
			<p>“And our contract specifically gives the United States the right to take action against us in case we endanger the national security,” Karen added. She stuffed her cigarette into the not-too-recently-emptied receiver beside her chair, her blue eyes troubled. “You know, some of us could get shot over this, if we’re not careful. Dunc, does it really have to be one of our own people who⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“I don’t see how it could be anybody else,” MacLeod said. “I don’t like the idea any more than you do, but there it is.”</p>
			<p>“Well, what are we going to do? Is there nobody whom we can trust?”</p>
			<p>“Among the technicians and guards, yes. I could think of a score who are absolutely loyal. But among the Team itself⁠—the top researchers⁠—there’s nobody I’d take a chance on but Kato Sugihara.”</p>
			<p>“Can you even be sure of him? I’d hate to think of him as a traitor, but⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I have a couple of reasons for eliminating Kato,” MacLeod said. “In the first place, outside nucleonic and binding-force physics, there are only three things he’s interested in. Jitterbugging, hand-painted neckties, and Southern-style cooking. If he went over to the Komintern, he wouldn’t be able to get any of those. Then, he only spends about half his share of the Team’s profits, and turns the rest back into the Team Fund. He has a credit of about a hundred thousand dollars, which he’d lose by leaving us. And then, there’s another thing. Kato’s father was killed on Guadalcanal, in 1942, when he was only five. After that he was brought up in the teachings of Bushido by his grandfather, an old-time samurai. Bushido is open to some criticism, but nobody can show where double-crossing your own gang is good Bushido. And today, Japan is allied with the Western Union, and in any case, he wouldn’t help the Komintern. The Japs’ll forgive Russia for that Mussolini back-stab in 1945 after the Irish start building monuments to Cromwell.”</p>
			<p>A light-blue jeep, lettered <q>MacLeod Research Team</q> in cherry-red, was approaching across the wide concrete apron. MacLeod grinned.</p>
			<p>“Here it comes. Fasten your safety belt when you get in; that’s Ahmed driving.”</p>
			<p>Karen looked at her watch. “And it’s almost time for dinner. You know, I dread the thought of sitting at the table with the others, and wondering which of them is betraying us.”</p>
			<p>“Only nine of us, instead of thirteen, and still one is a Judas,” MacLeod said. “I suppose there’s always a place for Judas, at any table.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The MacLeod Team dined together, apart from their assistants and technicians and students. This was no snobbish attempt at class-distinction: matters of Team policy were often discussed at the big round table, and the more confidential details of their work. People who have only their knowledge and their ideas to sell are wary about bandying either loosely, and the six men and three women who faced each other across the twelve-foot diameter of the teakwood table had no other stock-in-trade.</p>
			<p>They were nine people of nine different nationalities, or they were nine people of the common extra-nationality of science. That Duncan MacLeod, their leader, had grown up in the Transvaal and his wife had been born in the Swedish university town of Upsala was typical not only of their own group but of the hundreds of independent research-teams that had sprung up after the Second World War. The scientist-adventurer may have been born of the relentless struggle for scientific armament supremacy among nations and the competition for improved techniques among industrial corporations during the late 1950s and early ’60s, but he had been begotten when two masses of uranium came together at the top of a steel tower in New Mexico in 1945. And, because scientific research is preeminently a matter of pooling brains and efforts, the independent scientists had banded together into teams whose leaders acquired power greater than that of any condottiere captain of Renaissance Italy.</p>
			<p>Duncan MacLeod, sitting outwardly relaxed and merry and secretly watchful and bitterly sad, was such a free-captain of science. One by one, the others had rallied around him, not because he was a greater physicist than they, but because he was a bolder, more clever, less scrupulous adventurer, better able to guide them through the maze of international power-politics and the no less ruthless if less nakedly violent world of Big Industry.</p>
			<p>There was his wife, Karen Hilquist, the young metallurgist who, before she was twenty-five, had perfected a new hardening process for <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">S.K.F.</abbr> and an incredibly tough gun-steel for the Bofors works. In the few minutes since they had returned to Team Center, she had managed to change her coveralls for a skirt and blouse, and do something intriguing with her hair.</p>
			<p>And there was Kato Sugihara, looking younger than his twenty-eight years, who had begun to demonstrate the existence of whole orders of structure below the level of nuclear particles.</p>
			<p>There was Suzanne Maillard, her gray hair upswept from a face that had never been beautiful but which was alive with something rarer than mere beauty: she possessed, at the brink of fifty, a charm and smartness that many women half her age might have envied, and she knew more about cosmic rays than any other person living.</p>
			<p>And Adam Lowiewski, his black mustache contrasting so oddly with his silver hair, frantically scribbling equations on his doodling-pad, as though his racing fingers could never keep pace with his brain, and explaining them, with obvious condescension, to the boyish-looking Japanese beside him. He was one of the greatest of living mathematicians by anybody’s reckoning⁠—<em>the</em> greatest, by his own.</p>
			<p>And Sir Neville Lawton, the electronics expert, with thinning red-gray hair and meticulously-clipped mustache, who always gave the impression of being in evening clothes, even when, as now, he was dressed in faded khaki.</p>
			<p>And Heym ben-Hillel, the Israeli quantum and wave-mechanics man, his heaping dinner plate an affront to the Laws of Moses, his white hair a fluffy, tangled chaos, laughing at an impassively-delivered joke the English knight had made.</p>
			<p>And Rudolf von Heldenfeld, with a thin-lipped killer’s mouth and a frozen face that never betrayed its owner’s thoughts⁠—he was the specialist in magnetic currents and electromagnetic fields.</p>
			<p>And Farida Khouroglu, the Turkish girl whom MacLeod and Karen had found begging in the streets of Istanbul, ten years ago, and who had grown up following the fortunes of the MacLeod Team on every continent and in a score of nations. It was doubtful if she had ever had a day’s formal schooling in her life, but now she was secretary of the Team, with a grasp of physics that would have shamed many a professor. She had grown up a beauty, too, with the large dark eyes and jet-black hair and paper-white skin of her race. She and Kato Sugihara were very much in love.</p>
			<p>A good team; the best physics-research team in a power-mad, knowledge-hungry world. MacLeod thought, toying with the stem of his wineglass, of some of their triumphs: The West Australia Atomic Power Plant. The Segovia Plutonium Works, which had got them all titled as Grandees of the restored Spanish Monarchy. The seawater chemical extraction plant in Puerto Rico, where they had worked for Associated Enterprises, whose president, Blake Hartley, had later become President of the United States. The hard-won victory over a seemingly insoluble problem in the Belgian Congo uranium mines⁠—He thought, too, of the dangers they had faced together, in a world where soldiers must use the weapons of science and scientists must learn the arts of violence. Of the treachery of the Islamic Kaliphate, for whom they had once worked; of the intrigues and plots which had surrounded them in Spain; of the many attempted kidnappings and assassinations; of the time in Basra when they had fought with pistols and tommy guns and snatched-up clubs and flasks of acid to defend their laboratories.</p>
			<p>A good team⁠—before the rot of treason had touched it. He could almost smell the putrid stench of it, and yet, as he glanced from face to face, he could not guess the traitor. And he had so little time⁠—</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Kato Sugihara’s voice rose to dominate the murmur of conversation around the table.</p>
			<p>“I think I am getting somewhere on my photon-neutrino-electron interchange-cycle,” he announced. “And I think it can be correlated to the collapsed-matter research.”</p>
			<p>“So?” von Heldenfeld looked up in interest. “And not with the problem of what goes on in the ‘hot layer’ surrounding the Earth?”</p>
			<p>“No, Suzanne talked me out of that idea,” the Japanese replied. “That’s just a secondary effect of the effect of cosmic rays and solar radiations on the order of particles existing at that level. But I think that I have the key to the problem of collapsing matter to plate the hull of the spaceship.”</p>
			<p>“That’s interesting,” Sir Neville Lawton commented. “How so?”</p>
			<p>“Well, you know what happens when a photon comes in contact with the atomic structure of matter,” Kato said. “There may be an elastic collision, in which the photon merely bounces off. Macroscopically, that’s the effect we call reflection of light. Or there may be an inelastic collision, when the photon hits an atom and knocks out an electron⁠—the old photoelectric effect. Or, the photon may be retained for a while and emitted again relatively unchanged⁠—the effect observed in luminous paint. Or, the photon may penetrate, undergo a change to a neutrino, and either remain in the nucleus of the atom or pass through it, depending upon a number of factors. All this, of course, is old stuff; even the photon-neutrino interchange has been known since the mid-’50s, when the Gamow neutrino-counter was developed. But now we come to what you have been so good as to christen the Sugihara Effect⁠—the neutrino picking up a negative charge and, in effect, turning into an electron, and then losing its charge, turning back into a neutrino, and then, as in the case of metal heated to incandescence, being emitted again as a photon.</p>
			<p>“At first, we thought this had no connection with the spaceship insulation problem we are under contract to work out, and we agreed to keep this effect a Team secret until we could find out if it had commercial possibilities. But now, I find that it has a direct connection with the collapsed-matter problem. When the electron loses its negative charge and reverts to a neutrino, there is a definite accretion of interatomic binding-force, and the molecule, or the crystalline lattice or whatever tends to contract, and when the neutrino becomes a photon, the nucleus of the atom contracts.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Heym ben-Hillel was sitting oblivious to everything but his young colleague’s words, a slice of the flesh of the unclean beast impaled on his fork and halfway to his mouth.</p>
			<p>“Yes! Certainly!” he exclaimed. “That would explain so many things I have wondered about: And of course, there are other forces at work which, in the course of nature, balance that effect⁠—”</p>
			<p>“But can the process be controlled?” Suzanne Maillard wanted to know. “Can you convert electrons to neutrinos and then to photons in sufficient numbers, and eliminate other effects that would cause compensating atomic and molecular expansion?”</p>
			<p>Kato grinned, like a tomcat contemplating the bones of a fish he has just eaten.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I can. I have.” He turned to MacLeod. “Remember those bullets I got from you?” he asked.</p>
			<p>MacLeod nodded. He handloaded for his .38-special, and like all advanced cases of handloading-fever, he was religiously fanatical about uniformity of bullet weights and dimensions. Unlike most handloaders, he had available the instruments to secure such uniformity.</p>
			<p>“Those bullets are as nearly alike as different objects can be,” Kato said. “They weigh 158 grains, and that means one-five-eight-point-zero-zero-zero-practically-nothing. The diameter is .35903 inches. All right; I’ve been subjecting those bullets to different radiation-bombardments, and the best results have given me a bullet with a diameter of .35892 inches, and the weight is unchanged. In other words, there’s been no loss of mass, but the mass had contracted. And that’s only been the first test.”</p>
			<p>“Well, write up everything you have on it, and we’ll lay out further experimental work,” MacLeod said. He glanced around the table. “So far, we can’t be entirely sure. The shrinkage may be all in the crystalline lattice: the atomic structure may be unchanged. What we need is matter that is really collapsed.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll do that,” Kato said. “Barida, I’ll have all my data available for you before noon tomorrow: you can make up copies for all Team members.”</p>
			<p>“Make mine on microfilm, for projection,” von Heldenfeld said.</p>
			<p>“Mine, too,” Sir Neville Lawton added.</p>
			<p>“Better make microfilm copies for everybody,” Heym ben-Hillel suggested. “They’re handier than typescript.”</p>
			<p>MacLeod rose silently and tiptoed around behind his wife and Rudolf von Heldenfeld, to touch Kato Sugihara on the shoulder.</p>
			<p>“Come on outside, Kato,” he whispered. “I want to talk to you.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Japanese nodded and rose, following him outside onto the roof above the laboratories. They walked over to the edge and stopped at the balustrade.</p>
			<p>“Kato, when you write up your stuff, I want you to falsify everything you can. Put it in such form that the data will be absolutely worthless, but also in such form that nobody, not even Team members, will know it has been falsified. Can you do that?”</p>
			<p>Kato’s almond-shaped eyes widened. “Of course I can, Dunc,” he replied. “But why⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“I hate to say this, but we have a traitor in the Team. One of those people back in the dining room is selling us out to the Fourth Komintern. I know it’s not Karen, and I know it’s not you, and that’s as much as I do know, now.”</p>
			<p>The Japanese sucked in his breath in a sharp hiss. “You wouldn’t say that unless you were sure, Dunc,” he said.</p>
			<p>“No. At about 1000 this morning, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Weissberg, the civilian director, called me to his office. I found him very much upset. He told me that General Nayland is accusing us⁠—by which he meant this Team⁠—of furnishing secret information on our subproject to Komintern agents. He said that British Intelligence agents at Smolensk had learned that the Red Triumph laboratories there were working along lines of research originated at MacLeod Team Center here. They relayed the information to Western Union Central Intelligence, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">W.U.</abbr> passed it on to United States Central Intelligence, and now Counter Espionage is riding Nayland about it, and he’s trying to make us the goat.”</p>
			<p>“He would love to get some of us shot,” Kato said. “And that could happen. They took a long time getting tough about espionage in this country, but when Americans get tough about something, they get tough right. But look here; we handed in our progress-reports to Felix Weissberg, and he passed them on to Nayland. Couldn’t the leak be right in Nayland’s own <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.Q.</abbr>?”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I thought, at first,” MacLeod replied. “Just wishful thinking, though. Fact is, I went up to Nayland’s <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.Q.</abbr> and had it out with him; accused him of just that. I think I threw enough of a scare into him to hold him for a couple of days. I wanted to know just what it was the Komintern was supposed to have got from us, but he wouldn’t tell me. That, of course, was classified-stuff.”</p>
			<p>“Well?”</p>
			<p>“Well then, Karen and I got our digestive tracts emptied and went in to town, where I could use a phone that didn’t go through a military switchboard, and I put through a call to Allan Hartley, President Hartley’s son. He owes us a break, after the work we did in Puerto Rico. I told him all I wanted was some information to help clear ourselves, and he told me to wait a half an hour and then call Counter Espionage Office in Washington and talk to General Hammond.”</p>
			<p>“Ha! If Allan Hartley’s for us, what are we worried about?” Kato asked. “I always knew he was the power back of Associated Enterprises and his father was the front-man: I’ll bet it’s the same with the Government.”</p>
			<p>“Allan Hartley’s for us as long as our nose is clean. If we let it get dirty, we get it bloodied, too. We have to clean it ourselves,” MacLeod told him. “But here’s what Hammond gave me: The Komintern knows all about our collapsed-matter experiments with zinc, titanium and nickel. They know about our theoretical work on cosmic rays, including Suzanne’s work up to about a month ago. They know about that effect Sir Neville and Heym discovered two months ago.” He paused. “And they know about the photon-neutrino-electron interchange.”</p>
			<p>Kato responded to this with a gruesome double-take that gave his face the fleeting appearance of an ancient samurai war mask.</p>
			<p>“That wasn’t included in any report we ever made,” he said. “You’re right: the leak comes from inside the Team. It must be Sir Neville, or Suzanne, or Heym ben-Hillel, or Adam Lowiewski, or Rudolf von Heldenfeld, or⁠—No! No, I can’t believe it could be Farida!” He looked at MacLeod pleadingly. “You don’t think she could have⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“No, Kato. The Team’s her whole life, even more than it is mine. She came with us when she was only twelve, and grew up with us. She doesn’t know any other life than this, and wouldn’t want any other. It has to be one of the other five.”</p>
			<p>“Well, there’s Suzanne,” Kato began. “She had to clear out of France because of political activities, after the collapse of the Fourth Republic and the establishment of the Rightist Directoire in ’57. And she worked with Joliot-Curie, and she was at the University of Louvain in the early ’50s, when that place was crawling with Commies.”</p>
			<p>“And that brings us to Sir Neville,” MacLeod added. “He dabbles in spiritualism; he and Suzanne do planchette-séances. A planchette can be manipulated. Maybe Suzanne produced a communication advising Sir Neville to help the Komintern.”</p>
			<p>“Could be. Then, how about Lowiewski? He’s a Pole who can’t go back to Poland, and Poland’s a Komintern country.” Kato pointed out. “Maybe he’d sell us out for amnesty, though why he’d want to go back there, the way things are now⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“His vanity. You know, missionary-school native going back to the village wearing real pants, to show off to the savages. Used to be a standing joke, down where I came from.” MacLeod thought for a moment. “And Rudolf: he’s always had a poor view of the democratic system of government. He might feel more at home with the Komintern. Of course, the Ruskis killed his parents in 1945⁠—”</p>
			<p>“So what?” Kato retorted. “The Americans killed my father in 1942, but I’m not making an issue out of it. That was another war; Japan’s a Western Union country, now. So’s Germany⁠—How about Heym, by the way? Remember when the Komintern wanted us to come to Russia and do the same work we’re doing here?”</p>
			<p>“I remember that after we turned them down, somebody tried to kidnap Karen,” MacLeod said grimly. “I remember a couple of Russians got rather suddenly dead trying it, too.”</p>
			<p>“I wasn’t thinking of that. I was thinking of our roundtable argument when the proposition was considered. Heym was in favor of accepting. Now that, I would say, indicates either Communist sympathies or an overtrusting nature,” Kato submitted. “And a lot of grade-A traitors have been made out of people with trusting natures.”</p>
			<p>MacLeod got out his pipe and lit it. For a long time, he stared out across the mountain-ringed vista of sagebrush, dotted at wide intervals with the bulks of research-centers and the red roofs of the villages.</p>
			<p>“Kato, I think I know how we’re going to find out which one it is,” he said. “First of all, you write up your data, and falsify it so that it won’t do any damage if it gets into Komintern hands. And then⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The next day started in an atmosphere of suppressed excitement and anxiety, which, beginning with MacLeod and Karen and Kato Sugihara, seemed to communicate itself by contagion to everybody in the MacLeod Team’s laboratories. The top researchers and their immediate assistants and students were the first to catch it; they ascribed the tension under which their leader and his wife and the Japanese labored to the recent developments in the collapsed-matter problem. Then, there were about a dozen implicitly-trusted technicians and guards, who had been secretly gathered in MacLeod’s office the night before and informed of the crisis that had arisen. Their associates could not miss the fact that they were preoccupied with something unusual.</p>
			<p>They were a variegated crew; men who had been added to the Team in every corner of the world. There was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman, the Arab jeep-driver who had joined them in Basra. There was the wiry little Greek whom everybody called Alex Unpronounceable. There was an Italian, and two Chinese, and a cashiered French Air Force officer, and a Malay, and the son of an English earl who insisted that his name was Bertie Wooster. They had sworn themselves to secrecy, had heard MacLeod’s story with a polylingual burst of pious or blasphemous exclamations, and then they had scattered, each to the work assigned him.</p>
			<p>MacLeod had risen early and submitted to the ordeal of the search to leave the reservation and go to town again, this time for a conference at the shabby back-street cigar store that concealed a Counter Espionage center. He had returned just as Farida Khouroglu was finishing the microfilm copies of Kato’s ingeniously-concocted pseudo-data. These copies were distributed at noon, while the Team was lunching, along with carbons of the original typescript.</p>
			<p>He was the first to leave the table, going directly to the basement, where Alex Unpronounceable and the man who had got his alias from the works of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P. G.</abbr> Wodehouse were listening in on the telephone calls going in and out through the Team-center switchboard, and making recordings. For two hours, MacLeod remained with them. He heard Suzanne Maillard and some woman who was talking from a number in the Army married-officers’ settlement making arrangements about a party. He heard Rudolf von Heldenfeld make a date with some girl. He listened to a violent altercation between the Team chef and somebody at Army Quartermaster’s <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.Q.</abbr> about the quality of a lot of dressed chicken. He listened to a call that came in for Adam Lowiewski, the mathematician.</p>
			<p>“This is Joe,” the caller said. “I’ve got to go to town late this afternoon, but I was wondering if you’d have time to meet me at the Recreation House at Oppenheimer Village for a game of chess. I’m calling from there, now.”</p>
			<p>“Fine; I can make it,” Lowiewski’s voice replied. “I’m in the middle of a devil’s own mathematical problem; maybe a game of chess would clear my head. I have a new queen’s-knight gambit I want to try on you, anyhow.”</p>
			<p>Bertie Wooster looked up sharply. “Now there; that may be what we’re⁠—”</p>
			<p>The telephone beside MacLeod rang. He scooped it up; named himself into it.</p>
			<p>It was Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman. “Look, chief; I tail this guy to Oppenheimer Village,” the Arab, who had learned English from American movies, answered. “He goes into the rec-joint. I slide in after him, an’ he ain’t in sight. I’m lookin’ around for him, see, when he comes bargin’ outa the Don Ameche box. Then he grabs a table an’ a beer. What next?”</p>
			<p>“Stay there; keep an eye on him,” MacLeod told him. “If I want you, I’ll call.”</p>
			<p>MacLeod hung up and straightened, feeling under his packet for his .38-special.</p>
			<p>“That’s it, boys,” he said. “Lowiewski. Come on.”</p>
			<p>“Hah!” Alex Unpronounceable had his gun out and was checking the cylinder. He spoke briefly in description of the Polish mathematician’s ancestry, physical characteristics, and probable postmortem destination. Then he put the gun away, and the three men left the basement.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>For minutes that seemed like hours, MacLeod and the Greek waited on the main floor, where they could watch both the elevators and the stairway. Bertie Wooster had gone up to alert Kato Sugihara and Karen. Then the door of one of the elevators opened and Adam Lowiewski emerged, with Kato behind him, apparently lost in a bulky scientific journal he was reading. The Greek moved in from one side, and MacLeod stepped in front of the Pole.</p>
			<p>“Hi, Adam,” he greeted. “Have you looked into that batch of data yet?”</p>
			<p>“Oh, yes. Yes.” Lowiewski seemed barely able to keep his impatience within the bounds of politeness. “Of course, it’s out of my line, but the mathematics seems sound.” He started to move away.</p>
			<p>“You’re not going anywhere,” MacLeod told him. “The chess game is over. The red pawns are taken⁠—the one at Oppenheimer Village, and the one here.”</p>
			<p>There was a split second in which Lowiewski struggled⁠—almost successfully⁠—to erase the consternation from his face.</p>
			<p>“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” he began. His right hand started to slide under his left coat lapel.</p>
			<p>MacLeod’s Colt was covering him before he could complete the movement. At the same time, Kato Sugihara dropped the paper-bound periodical, revealing the thin-bladed knife he had concealed under it. He stepped forward, pressing the point of the weapon against the Pole’s side. With the other hand, he reached across Lowiewski’s chest and jerked the pistol from his shoulder-holster. It was one of the elegant little .32 Beretta 1954 Model automatics.</p>
			<p>“Into the elevator,” MacLeod ordered. An increasing pressure of Kato’s knife emphasized the order. “And watch him; don’t let him get rid of anything,” he added to the Greek.</p>
			<p>“If you would explain this outrage⁠—” Lowiewski began. “I assume it is your idea of a joke⁠—”</p>
			<p>Without even replying, MacLeod slammed the doors and started the elevator upward, letting it rise six floors to the living quarters. Karen Hilquist and the aristocratic black-sheep who called himself Bertie Wooster were waiting when he opened the door. The Englishman took one of Lowiewski’s arms; MacLeod took the other. The rest fell in behind as they hustled the captive down the hall and into the big soundproofed dining room. They kept Lowiewski standing, well away from any movable object in the room; Alex Unpronounceable took his left arm as MacLeod released it and went to the communicator and punched the all-outlets button.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maillard; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Sir Neville Lawton; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> ben-Hillel; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> von Heldenfeld; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mlle.</abbr> Khouroglu,” he called. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> MacLeod speaking. Come at once, repeat at once, to the round table⁠—<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Maillard; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Sir Neville Lawton⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Karen said something to the Japanese and went outside. For a while, nobody spoke. Kato came over and lit a cigarette in the bowl of MacLeod’s pipe. Then the other Team members entered in a body. Evidently Karen had intercepted them in the hallway and warned them that they would find some unusual situation inside; even so, there was a burst of surprised exclamations when they found Adam Lowiewski under detention.</p>
			<p>“Ladies and gentlemen,” MacLeod said, “I regret to tell you that I have placed our colleague, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lowiewski, under arrest. He is suspected of betraying confidential data to agents of the Fourth Komintern. Yesterday, I learned that data on all our work here, including Team-secret data on the Sugihara Effect, had got into the hands of the Komintern and was being used in research at the Smolensk laboratories. I also learned that General Nayland blames this Team as a whole with double-dealing and selling this data to the Komintern. I don’t need to go into any lengthy exposition of General Nayland’s attitude toward this Team, or toward Free Scientists as a class, or toward the research-contract system. Nor do I need to point out that if he pressed these charges against us, some of us could easily suffer death or imprisonment.”</p>
			<p>“So he had to have a victim in a hurry, and pulled my name out of the hat,” Lowiewski sneered.</p>
			<p>“I appreciate the gravity of the situation,” Sir Neville Lawton said. “And if the Sugihara Effect was among the data betrayed, I can understand that nobody but one of us could have betrayed it. But why, necessarily, should it be Adam? We all have unlimited access to all records and theoretical data.”</p>
			<p>“Exactly. But collecting information is the smallest and easiest part of espionage. Almost anybody can collect information. Where the spy really earns his pay is in transmitting of information. Now, think of the almost fantastic security measures in force here, and consider how you would get such information, including masses of mathematical data beyond any human power of memorization, out of this reservation.”</p>
			<p>“Ha, nobody can take anything out,” Suzanne Maillard said. “Not even one’s breakfast. Is Adam accused of sorcery, too?”</p>
			<p>“The only material things that are allowed to leave this reservation are sealed cases of models and data shipped to the different development plants. And the Sugihara Effect never was reported, and wouldn’t go out that way,” Heym ben-Hillel objected.</p>
			<p>“But the data on the Sugihara Effect reached Smolensk,” MacLeod replied. “And don’t talk about Darwin and Wallace: it wasn’t a coincidence. This stuff was taken out of the Tonto Basin Reservation by the only person who could have done so, in the only way that anything could leave the reservation without search. So I had that person shadowed, and at the same time I had our telephone lines tapped, and eavesdropped on all calls entering or leaving this center. And the person who had to be the spy-courier called Adam Lowiewski, and Lowiewski made an appointment to meet him at the Oppenheimer Village Recreation House to play chess.”</p>
			<p>“Very suspicious, very suspicious,” Lowiewski derided. “I receive a call from a friend at the same time that some anonymous suspect is using the phone. There are only five hundred telephone conversations a minute on this reservation.”</p>
			<p>“Immediately, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lowiewski attempted to leave this building,” MacLeod went on. “When I intercepted him, he tried to draw a pistol. This one.” He exhibited the Beretta. “I am now going to have <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lowiewski searched, in the presence of all of you.” He nodded to Alex and the Englishman.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They did their work thoroughly. A pile of Lowiewski’s pocket effects was made on the table; as each item was added to it, the Pole made some sarcastic comment.</p>
			<p>“And that pack of cigarettes: unopened,” he jeered. “I suppose I communicated the data to the manufacturers by telepathy, and they printed it on the cigarette papers in invisible ink.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe not. Maybe you opened the pack, and then resealed it,” Kato suggested. “A heated spatula under the cellophane; like this.”</p>
			<p>He used the point of his knife to illustrate. The cellophane came unsealed with surprising ease: so did the revenue stamp. He dumped out the contents of the pack: sixteen cigarettes, four cigarette tip-ends, four bits snapped from the other ends⁠—and a small aluminum microfilm capsule.</p>
			<p>Lowiewski’s face twitched. For an instant, he tried vainly to break loose from the men who held him. Then he slumped into a chair. Heym ben-Hillel gasped in shocked surprise. Suzanne Maillard gave a short, felinelike cry. Sir Neville Lawton looked at the capsule curiously and said: “Well, my sainted Aunt Agatha!”</p>
			<p>“That’s the capsule I gave him, at noon,” Farida Khouroglu exclaimed, picking it up. She opened it and pulled out a roll of colloidex projection film. There was also a bit of cigarette paper in the capsule, upon which a notation had been made in Kyrilic characters.</p>
			<p>Rudolf von Heldenfeld could read Russian. “ ‘Data on new development of photon-neutrino-electron interchange. 22 July, ’65. Vladmir.’ Vladmir, I suppose, is this <i xml:lang="de">schweinhund</i>’s code name,” he added.</p>
			<p>The film and the paper passed from hand to hand. The other members of the Team sat down; there was a tendency to move away from the chair occupied by Adam Lowiewski. He noticed this and sneered.</p>
			<p>“Afraid of contamination from the moral leper?” he asked. “You were glad enough to have me correct your stupid mathematical errors.”</p>
			<p>Kato Sugihara picked up the capsule, took a final glance at the cigarette pack, and said to MacLeod: “I’ll be back as soon as this is done.” With that, he left the room, followed by Bertie Wooster and the Greek.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Heym ben-Hillel turned to the others: his eyes had the hurt and puzzled look of a dog that has been kicked for no reason. “But why did he do this?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“He just told you,” MacLeod replied. “He’s the great Adam Lowiewski. Checking math for a physics-research team is beneath his dignity. I suppose the Komintern offered him a professorship at Stalin University.” He was watching Lowiewski’s face keenly. “No,” he continued. “It was probably the mathematics chair of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.”</p>
			<p>“But who was this person who could smuggle microfilm out of the reservation?” Suzanne Maillard wanted to know. “Somebody has invented teleportation, then?”</p>
			<p>MacLeod shook his head. “It was General Nayland’s chauffeur. It had to be. General Nayland’s car is the only thing that gets out of here without being searched. The car itself is serviced at Army vehicles pool; nobody could hide anything in it for a confederate to pick up outside. Nayland is a stuffed shirt of the first stuffing, and a tinpot Hitler to boot, but he is fanatically and incorruptibly patriotic. That leaves the chauffeur. When Nayland’s in the car, nobody even sees him; he might as well be a robot steering-device. Old case of Father Brown’s Invisible Man. So, since he had to be the courier, all I did was have Ahmed Abd-el-Rahman shadow him, and at the same time tap our phones. When he contacted Lowiewski, I knew Lowiewski was our traitor.”</p>
			<p>Sir Neville Lawton gave a strangling laugh. “Oh, my dear Aunt Fanny! And Nayland goes positively crackers on security. He gets goose pimples every time he hears somebody saying ’E = mc<sup>2</sup>,’ for fear a Komintern spy might hear him. It’s a wonder he hasn’t put the value of Planck’s Constant on the classified list. He sets up all these fantastic search rooms and barriers, and then he drives through the gate, honking his bloody horn, with his chauffeur’s pockets full of top secrets. Now I’ve seen everything!”</p>
			<p>“Not quite everything,” MacLeod said. “Kato’s going to put that capsule in another cigarette pack, and he’ll send one of his lab girls to Oppenheimer Village with it, with a message from Lowiewski to the effect that he couldn’t get away. And when this chauffeur takes it out, he’ll run into a Counter Espionage roadblock on the way to town. They’ll shoot him, of course, and they’ll probably transfer Nayland to the Mississippi Valley Flood Control Project, where he can’t do any more damage. At least, we’ll have him out of our hair.”</p>
			<p>“If we have any hair left,” Heym ben-Hillel gloomed. “You’ve got Nayland into trouble, but you haven’t got us out of it.”</p>
			<p>“What do you mean?” Suzanne Maillard demanded. “He’s found the traitor and stopped the leak.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, but we’re still responsible, as a team, for this betrayal,” the Israeli pointed out. “This Nayland is only a symptom of the enmity which politicians and militarists feel toward the Free Scientists, and of their opposition to the research-contract system. Now they have a scandal to use. Our part in stopping the leak will be ignored; the publicity will be about the treason of a Free Scientist.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” Sir Neville Lawton agreed. “And that brings up another point. We simply can’t hand this fellow over to the authorities. If we do, we establish a precedent that may wreck the whole system under which we operate.”</p>
			<p>“Yes: it would be a fine thing if governments start putting Free Scientists on trial and shooting them,” Farida Khouroglu supported him. “In a few years, none of us would be safe.”</p>
			<p>“But,” Suzanne cried, “you are not arguing that this species of an animal be allowed to betray us unpunished?”</p>
			<p>“Look,” Rudolf von Heldenfeld said. “Let us give him his pistol, and one cartridge, and let him remove himself like a gentleman. He will spare himself the humiliation of trial and execution, and us all the embarrassment of having a fellow scientist pilloried as a traitor.”</p>
			<p>“Now there’s a typical Prussian suggestion,” Lowiewski said.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Kato Sugihara, returning alone, looked around the table. “Did I miss something interesting?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, very,” Lowiewski told him. “Your Junker friend thinks I should perform seppuku.”</p>
			<p>Kato nodded quickly. “Excellent idea!” he congratulated von Heldenfeld. “If he does, he’ll save everybody a lot of trouble. Himself included.” He nodded again. “If he does that, we can protect his reputation, after he’s dead.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t really see how,” Sir Neville objected. “When the Counter Espionage people were brought into this, the thing went out of our control.”</p>
			<p>“Why, this chauffeur was the spy, as well as the spy-courier,” MacLeod said. “The information he transmitted was picked up piecemeal from different indiscreet lab-workers and students attached to our team. Of course, we are investigating, mumble-mumble. Naturally, no one will admit, mumble-mumble. No stone will be left unturned, mumble-mumble. Disciplinary action, mumble-mumble.”</p>
			<p>“And I suppose he got that microfilm piecemeal, too?” Lowiewski asked.</p>
			<p>“Oh, that?” MacLeod shrugged. “That was planted on him. One of our girls arranged an opportunity for him to steal it from her, after we began to suspect him. Of course, Kato falsified everything he put into that report. As information, it’s worthless.”</p>
			<p>“Worthless? It’s better than that,” Kato grinned. “I’m really sorry the Komintern won’t get it. They’d try some of that stuff out with the big betatron at Smolensk, and a microsecond after they’d throw the switch, Smolensk would look worse than Hiroshima did.”</p>
			<p>“Well, why would our esteemed colleague commit suicide, just at this time?” Karen Hilquist asked.</p>
			<p>“Maybe plutonium poisoning.” Farida suggested. “He was doing something in the radiation-lab and got some <abbr>Pu</abbr> in him, and of course, shooting’s not as painful as that. So⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Oh, my dear!” Suzanne protested. “That but stinks! The great Adam Lowiewski, descending from his pinnacle of pure mathematics, to perform a vulgar experiment? With actual <em>things</em>?” The Frenchwoman gave an exaggerated shudder. “Horrors!”</p>
			<p>“Besides, if our people began getting radioactive, somebody would be sure to claim we were endangering the safely of the whole establishment, and the national-security clause would be invoked, and some nosy person would put a geiger on the dear departed,” Sir Neville added.</p>
			<p>“Nervous collapse.” Karen said. “According to the laity, all scientists are crazy. Crazy people kill themselves. Adam Lowiewski was a scientist. Ergo Adam Lowiewski killed himself. Besides, a nervous collapse isn’t instrumentally detectable.”</p>
			<p>Heym ben-Hillel looked at MacLeod, his eyes troubled.</p>
			<p>“But, Dunc; have we the right to put him to death, either by his own hand or by an Army firing squad?” he asked. “Remember he is not only a traitor; he is one of the world’s greatest mathematical minds. Have we a right to destroy that mind?”</p>
			<p>Von Heldenfeld shouted, banging his fist on the table: “I don’t care if he’s Gauss and Riemann and Lorenz and Poincare and Minkowski and Whitehead and Einstein, all collapsed into one! The man is a stinking traitor, not only to us, but to all scientists and all sciences! If he doesn’t shoot himself, hand him over to the United States, and let them shoot him! Why do we go on arguing?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Lowiewski was smiling, now. The panic that had seized him in the hallway below, and the desperation when the cigarette pack had been opened, had left him.</p>
			<p>“Now I have a modest proposal, which will solve your difficulties,” he said. “I have money, papers, clothing, everything I will need, outside the reservation. Suppose you just let me leave here. Then, if there is any trouble, you can use this fiction about the indiscreet underlings, without the unnecessary embellishment of my suicide⁠—”</p>
			<p>Rudolf von Heldenfeld let out an inarticulate roar of fury. For an instant he was beyond words. Then he sprang to his feet.</p>
			<p>“Look at him!” he cried. “Look at him, laughing in our faces, for the dupes and fools he thinks we are!” He thrust out his hand toward MacLeod. “Give me the pistol! He won’t shoot himself; I’ll do it for him!”</p>
			<p>“It would work, Dunc. Really, it would,” Heym ben-Hillel urged.</p>
			<p>“No,” Karen Hilquist contradicted. “If he left here, everybody would know what had happened, and we’d be accused of protecting him. If he kills himself, we can get things hushed up: dead traitors are good traitors. But if he remains alive, we must disassociate ourselves from him by handing him over.”</p>
			<p>“And wreck the prestige of the Team?” Lowiewski asked.</p>
			<p>“At least you will not live to see that!” Suzanne retorted.</p>
			<p>Heym ben-Hillel put his elbows on the table and his head in his hands. “Is there no solution to this?” he almost wailed.</p>
			<p>“Certainly: an obvious solution,” MacLeod said, rising. “Rudolf has just stated it. Only I’m leader of this Team, and there are, of course, jobs a team-leader simply doesn’t delegate.” The safety catch of the Beretta clicked a period to his words.</p>
			<p>“No!” The word was wrenched almost physically out of Lowiewski. He, too, was on his feet, a sudden desperate fear in his face. “No! You wouldn’t murder me!”</p>
			<p>“The term is ‘execute,’ ” MacLeod corrected. Then his arm swung up, and he shot Adam Lowiewski through the forehead.</p>
			<p>For an instant, the Pole remained on his feet. Then his knees buckled, and he fell forward against the table, sliding to the floor.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>MacLeod went around the table, behind Kato Sugihara and Farida Khouroglu and Heym ben-Hillel, and stood looking down at the man he had killed. He dropped the automatic within a few inches of the dead renegade’s outstretched hand, then turned to face the others.</p>
			<p>“I regret,” he addressed them, his voice and face blank of expression, “to announce that our distinguished colleague, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Adam Lowiewski, has committed suicide by shooting, after a nervous collapse resulting from overwork.”</p>
			<p>Sir Neville Lawton looked critically at the motionless figure on the floor.</p>
			<p>“I’m afraid we’ll have trouble making that stick, Dunc,” he said. “You shot him at about five yards; there isn’t a powder mark on him.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, sorry; I forgot.” MacLeod’s voice was mockingly contrite. “It was <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Lowiewski’s expressed wish that his remains be cremated as soon after death as possible, and that funeral services be held over his ashes. The big electric furnace in the metallurgical lab will do, I think.”</p>
			<p>“But⁠ ⁠… but there’ll be all sorts of formalities⁠—” the Englishman protested.</p>
			<p>“Now you forget. Our contract,” MacLeod reminded him. “We stand upon our contractual immunity: we certainly won’t allow any stupid bureaucratic interference with our deceased colleague’s wishes. We have a regular <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.D.</abbr> on our payroll, in case anybody has to have a death certificate to keep him happy, but beyond that⁠—” He shrugged.</p>
			<p>“It burns me up, though!” Suzanne Maillard cried. “After the spaceship is built, and the Moon is annexed to the Western Union, there will be publicity, and people will eulogize this species of an Iscariot!”</p>
			<p>Heym ben-Hillel, who had been staring at MacLeod in shocked unbelief, roused himself.</p>
			<p>“Well, why not? Isn’t the creator of the Lowiewski function transformations and the rules of inverse probabilities worthy of eulogy?” He turned to MacLeod. “I couldn’t have done what you did, but maybe it was for the best. The traitor is dead; the mathematician will live forever.”</p>
			<p>“You miss the whole point,” MacLeod said. “Both of you. It wasn’t a question of revenge, like gangsters bumping off a double-crosser. And it wasn’t a question of whitewashing Lowiewski for posterity. We are the MacLeod Research Team. We owe no permanent allegiance to, nor acknowledge the authority of, any national sovereignty or any combination of nations. We deal with national governments as with equals. In consequence, we must make and enforce our own laws.</p>
			<p>“You must understand that we enjoy this status only on sufferance. The nations of the world tolerate the Free Scientists only because they need us, and because they know they can trust us. Now, no responsible government official is going to be deceived for a moment by this suicide story we’ve confected. It will be fully understood that Lowiewski was a traitor, and that we found him out and put him to death. And, as a corollary, it will be understood that this Team, as a Team, is fully trustworthy, and that when any individual Team member is found to be untrustworthy, he will be dealt with promptly and without public scandal. In other words, it will be understood, from this time on, that the MacLeod Team is worthy of the status it enjoys and the responsibilities concomitant with it.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">The Return</h2>
			<p class="authors">By <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Beam Piper and John <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J.</abbr> McGuire</p>
			<p>Altamont cast a quick, routine, glance at the instrument panels and then looked down through the transparent nose of the helicopter at the yellow-brown river five hundred feet below. Next he scraped the last morsel from his plate and ate it.</p>
			<p>“What did you make this out of, Jim?” he asked. “I hope you kept notes, while you were concocting it. It’s good.”</p>
			<p>“The two smoked pork chops left over from yesterday evening,” Loudons said, “and that bowl of rice that’s been taking up space in the refrigerator the last couple of days together with a little egg powder, and some milk. I ground the chops up and mixed them with the rice and the other stuff. Then added some bacon, to make grease to fry it in.”</p>
			<p>Altamont chuckled. That was Loudons, all right; he could take a few leftovers, mess them together, pop them in the skillet, and have a meal that would turn the chef back at the Fort green with envy. He filled his cup and offered the pot.</p>
			<p>“Caffchoc?” he asked.</p>
			<p>Loudons held his cup out to be filled, blew on it, sipped, and then hunted on the ledge under the desk for the butt of the cigar he had half-smoked the evening before.</p>
			<p>“Did you ever drink coffee, Monty?” the socio-psychologist asked, getting the cigar drawing to his taste.</p>
			<p>“Coffee? No. I’ve read about it, of course. We’ll have to organize an expedition to Brazil, some time, to get seeds, and try raising some.”</p>
			<p>Loudons blew a smoke ring toward the rear of the cabin.</p>
			<p>“A much overrated beverage,” he replied. “We found some, once, when I was on that expedition into Idaho, in what must have been the stockroom of a hotel. Vacuum-packed in moisture-proof containers, and free from radioactivity. It wasn’t nearly as good as caffchoc. But then, I suppose, a pre-bustup coffee drinker couldn’t stomach this stuff we’re drinking.” He looked forward, up the river they were following. “Get anything on the radio?” he asked. “I noticed you took us up to about ten thousand, while I was shaving.”</p>
			<p>Altamont got out his pipe and tobacco pouch, filling the former slowly and carefully.</p>
			<p>“Not a whisper. I tried Colony Three, in the Ozarks, and I tried to call in that tribe of workers in Louisiana; I couldn’t get either.”</p>
			<p>“Maybe if we tried to get a little more power on the set⁠—”</p>
			<p>That was Loudons, too, Altamont thought. There wasn’t a better man at the Fort, when it came to dealing with people, but confront him with a problem about things, and he was lost. That was one of the reasons why he and the stocky, phlegmatic social scientist made such a good team, he thought. As far as he, himself, was concerned, people were just a mysterious, exasperatingly unpredictable, order of things which were subject to no known natural laws. That was about the way Loudons thought of things; he couldn’t psychoanalyze them.</p>
			<p>He gestured with his pipe toward the nuclear-electric conversion unit, between the control-cabin and the living quarters in the rear of the boxcar-sized helicopter.</p>
			<p>“We have enough power back there to keep this windmill in the air twenty-four hours a day, three hundred and sixty-five days a year, for the next fifteen years,” he said. “We just don’t have enough radio. If I’d step up the power on this set any more, it’d burn out before I could say, ‘Altamont calling Fort Ridgeway.’ ”</p>
			<p>“How far are we from Pittsburgh, now?” Loudons wanted to know.</p>
			<p>Altamont looked across the cabin at the big map of the United States, with its red and green and blue and yellow patchwork of vanished political divisions, and the transparent overlay on which they had plotted their course. The red line started at Fort Ridgeway, in what had once been Arizona It angled east by a little north, to Colony Three, in northern Arkansas; then sharply northeast to <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis and its lifeless ruins; then Chicago and Gary, where little bands of Stone Age reversions stalked and fought and ate each other; Detroit, where things that had completely forgotten that they were human emerged from their burrows only at night; Cleveland, where a couple of cobalt bombs must have landed in the lake and drenched everything with radioactivity that still lingered after two centuries; Akron, where vegetation was only beginning to break through the glassy slag; Cincinnati, where they had last stopped⁠—</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“How’s the leg, this morning, Jim?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Little stiff. Doesn’t hurt much, though.”</p>
			<p>“Why, we’re about fifty miles, as we follow the river, and that’s relatively straight.” He looked down through the transparent nose of the ’copter at a town, now choked with trees that grew among tumbled walls. “I think that’s Aliquippa.”</p>
			<p>Loudons looked and shrugged, then looked again and pointed.</p>
			<p>“There’s a bear. Just ducked into that church or movie theater or whatever. I wonder what he thinks we are.”</p>
			<p>Altamont puffed slowly at his pipe, “I wonder if we’re going to find anything at all in Pittsburgh.”</p>
			<p>“You mean people, as distinct from those biped beasts we’ve found so far? I doubt it,” Loudons replied, finishing his caffchoc and wiping his mustache on the back of his hand. “I think the whole eastern half of the country is nothing but forest like this, and the highest type of life is just about three cuts below <i epub:type="z3998:taxonomy">Homo Neanderthalensis</i>, almost impossible to contact, and even more impossible to educate.”</p>
			<p>“I wasn’t thinking about that; I’ve just about given up hope of finding anybody or even a reasonably high level of barbarism,” Altamont said. “I was thinking about that cache of microfilmed books that was buried at the Carnegie Library.”</p>
			<p>“If it was buried,” Loudons qualified. “All we have is that article in that two-century-old copy of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.magazine">Time</i> about how the people at the library had constructed the crypt and were beginning the microfilming. We don’t know if they ever had a chance to get it finished, before the rockets started landing.”</p>
			<p>They passed over a dam of flotsam that had banked up at a wrecked bridge and accumulated enough mass to resist the periodic floods that had kept the river usually clear. Three human figures fled across a sand-flat at one end of it and disappeared into the woods; two of them carried spears tipped with something that sparkled in the sunlight, probably shards of glass.</p>
			<p>“You know, Monty, I get nightmares, sometimes, about what things must be like in Europe,” Loudons said.</p>
			<p>Five or six wild cows went crashing through the brush below. Altamont nodded when he saw them.</p>
			<p>“Maybe tomorrow, we’ll let down and shoot a cow,” he said. “I was looking in the freezer-locker; the fresh meat’s getting a little low. Or a wild pig, if we find a good stand of oak trees. I could enjoy what you’d do with some acorn-fed pork. Finished?” he asked Loudons. “Take over, then; I’ll go back and wash the dishes.”</p>
			<p>They rose, and Loudons, favoring his left leg, moved over to the seat at the controls. Altamont gathered up the two cups, the stainless-steel dishes, and the knives and forks and spoons, going up the steps over the shielded converter and ducking his head to avoid the seat in the forward top machine-gun turret. He washed and dried the dishes, noting with satisfaction that the gauge of the water tank was still reasonably high, and glanced out one of the windows. Loudons was taking the big helicopter upstairs, for a better view.</p>
			<p>Now and then, among the trees, there would be a glint of glassy slag, usually in a fairly small circle. That was to be expected; beside the three or four H-bombs that had fallen on the Pittsburgh area, mentioned in the transcripts of the last news to reach the Fort from outside, the whole district had been pelted, more or less at random, with fission bombs. West of the confluence of the Allegheny and Monongahela, it would probably be worse than this.</p>
			<p>“Can you see Pittsburgh yet, Jim?” he called out.</p>
			<p>“Yes; it’s a mess! Worse than Gary; worse than Akron, even. <em>Monty!</em> Come here! I think I have something!”</p>
			<p>Picking up the pipe he had laid down, Altamont hurried forward, dodging his six-foot length under the gun turret and swinging down from the walkway over the converter.</p>
			<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Smoke. A lot of smoke, twenty or thirty fires, at the very least.” Loudons had shifted from “Forward” to “Hover,” and was peering through a pair of binoculars. “See that island, the long one? Across the river from it, on the north side, toward this end. Yes, by Einstein! And I can see cleared ground, and what I think are houses, inside a stockade⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Murray Hughes walked around the corner of the cabin, into the morning sunlight, lacing his trousers, with his hunting shirt thrown over his bare shoulders, and found, without much surprise, that his father had also slept late. Verner Hughes was just beginning to shave. Inside the kitchen, his mother and the girls were clattering pots and skillets; his younger brother, Hector, was noisily chopping wood. Going through the door, he filled another of the light-metal basins with hot water, found his razor, and went outside again, setting the basin on the bench.</p>
			<p>Most of the ware in the Hughes cabin was of light-metal; Murray and his father had mined it in the dead city up the river, from a place where it had floated to the top of a puddle of slag, back when the city had been blasted, at the end of the Old Times. It had been hard work, but the stuff had been easy to carry down to where they had hidden their boat, and, for once, they’d had no trouble with the Scowrers. Too bad they couldn’t say as much for yesterday’s hunting trip!</p>
			<p>As he rubbed lather into the stubble on his face, he cursed with irritation. That had been a bad-luck hunt, all around. They’d gone out before dawn, hunting into the hills to the north, they’d spent all day at it, and shot one small wild pig. Lucky it was small, at that. They’d have had to abandon a full-grown one, after the Scowrers began hunting them. Six of them, as big a band as he’d ever seen together at one time, and they’d gotten between them and the stockade and forced them to circle miles out of their way. His father had shot one, and he’d had to leave his hatchet sticking in the skull of another, when his rifle had misfired.</p>
			<p>That meant a trip to the gunsmith’s, for a new hatchet and to have the mainspring of the rifle replaced. Nobody could afford to have a rifle that couldn’t be trusted, least of all a hunter and prospector. And he’d had words with Alex Barrett, the gunsmith, just the other day. Not that Barrett wouldn’t be more than glad to do business with him, once he saw that hard tool-steel he’d dug out of that place down the river. Hardest steel he’d ever found, and hadn’t been atom-spoiled, either.</p>
			<p>He cleaned, wiped and stropped his razor and put it back in the case; he threw out the wash-water on the compost-pile, and went into the cabin, putting on his shirt and his belt, and passed on through to the front porch, where his father was already eating at the table. The people of the Toon liked to eat in the open; it was something they’d always done, just as they’d always liked to eat together in the evenings.</p>
			<p>He sweetened his mug of chicory with a lump of maple sugar and began to sip it before he sat down, standing with one foot on the bench and looking down across the parade ground, past the Aitch-Cue House, toward the river and the wall.</p>
			<p>“If you’re coming around to Alex’s way of thinking⁠—and mine⁠—it won’t hurt you to admit it, son,” his father said.</p>
			<p>He turned, looking at his father with the beginning of anger, and then grinned. The elders were constantly keeping the young men alert with these tests. He checked back over his actions since he had come out onto the porch.</p>
			<p>To the table, sugar in his chicory, one foot on the bench, which had reminded him again of the absence of the hatchet from his belt and brought an automatic frown. Then the glance toward the gunsmith’s shop, and across the parade ground, at the houses into which so much labor had gone; the wall that had been built from rubble and topped with pointed stakes; the white slabs of marble from the ruined building that marked the graves of the First Tenant and the men of the Old Toon. He <em>had</em> thought, in that moment, that maybe his father and Alex Barrett and Reader Rawson and Tenant Mycroft Jones and the others were right⁠—there were too many things here that could not be moved along with them, if they decided to move.</p>
			<p>It would be false modesty, refusal to see things as they were, not to admit that he was the leader of the younger men, and the boys of the Irregulars. And last winter, the usual theological arguments about the proper chronological order of the Sacred Books and the true nature of the Risen One had been replaced by a violent controversy when Sholto Jiminez and Birdy Edwards had reopened the old question of the advisability of moving the Toon and settling elsewhere. He’d been in favor of the idea himself, but, for the last month or so, he had begun to doubt the wisdom of it. It was probably reluctance to admit this to himself that had brought on the strained feelings between himself and his old friend the gunsmith.</p>
			<p>“I’ll have to drill the Irregulars, today,” he said. “Birdy Edwards has been drilling them, while we’ve been hunting. But I’ll go up and see Alex about a new hatchet and fixing my rifle. I’ll have a talk with him.”</p>
			<p>He stepped forward to the edge of the porch, still munching on a honey-dipped piece of corn bread, and glanced up at the sky. That was a queer bird; he’d never seen a bird with a wing action like that. Then he realized that the object was not a bird at all.</p>
			<p>His father was staring at it, too.</p>
			<p>“Murray! That’s⁠ ⁠… that’s like the old stories from the time of the wars!”</p>
			<p>But Murray was already racing across the parade ground toward the Aitch-Cue House, where the big iron ring hung by its chain from a gallows-like post, with the hammer beside it.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The stockaded village grew larger, details became plainer, as the helicopter came slanting down and began spiraling around it. It was a fairly big place, some forty or fifty acres in a rough parallelogram, surrounded by a wall of varicolored stone and brick and concrete rubble from old ruins, topped with a palisade of pointed poles. There was a small jetty projecting out into the river, to which six or eight boats of different sorts were tied; a gate opened onto this from the wall. Inside the stockade, there were close to a hundred buildings, ranging from small cabins to a structure with a belfry, which seemed to have been a church, partly ruined in the war of two centuries ago and later rebuilt. A stream came down from the woods, across the cultivated land around the fortified village; there was a rough flume which carried the water from a dam close to the edge of the forest and provided a fall to turn a mill wheel.</p>
			<p>“Look; strip-farming,” Loudons pointed. “See the alternate strips of grass and plowed ground. Those people understand soil conservation. They have horses, too.”</p>
			<p>As he spoke, three riders left the village at a gallop, through a gate on the far side. They separated, and the people in the fields, who had all started for the village, turned and began hurrying toward the woods. Two of the riders headed for a pasture in which cattle had been grazing, and started herding them, also, into the woods. For a while, there was a scurrying of little figures in the village below, and then not a moving thing was in sight.</p>
			<p>“There’s good organization,” Loudons said. “Everybody seems to know what to do, and how to get it done promptly. And look how neat the whole place is. Policed up. I’ll bet anything we’ll find that they have a military organization, or a military tradition at least. We’ll have to find out; you can’t understand a people till you understand their background and their social organization.”</p>
			<p>“Humph. Let me have a look at their artifacts; that’ll tell what kind of people they are,” Altamont said, swinging his glasses back and forth over the enclosure. “Waterpower mill, waterpower sawmill⁠—building on the left side of the water wheel; see the pile of fresh lumber beside it. Blacksmith shop, and from that chimney I’d say a small foundry, too. Wonder what that little building out on the tip of the island is; it has a water wheel. Undershot wheel, and it looks as though it could be raised or lowered. But the building’s too small for a grist mill. Now, I wonder⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Monty, I think we ought to land right in the middle of the enclosure, on that open plaza thing, in front of that building that looks like a reconditioned church. That’s probably the Royal Palace, or the Pentagon, or the Kremlin, or whatever.”</p>
			<p>Altamont started to object, paused, and then nodded. “I think you’re right, Jim. From the way they scattered, and got their livestock into the woods, they probably expect us to bomb them. We have to get inside; that’s the quickest way to do it.” He thought for a moment. “We’d better be armed, when we go out. Pistols, auto-carbines, and a few of those concussion-grenades in case we have to break up a concerted attack. I’ll get them.”</p>
			<p>The plaza and the houses and cabins around it, and the two-hundred-year-old church, were silent and, apparently, lifeless as they set the helicopter down. Once Loudons caught a movement inside the door of a house, and saw a metallic glint. Altamont pointed up at the belfry.</p>
			<p>“There’s a gun up there,” he said. “Looks like about a four-pounder. Brass. I knew that smith-shop was also a foundry. See that little curl of smoke? That’s the gunner’s slow-match. I’d thought maybe that thing on the island was a powder mill. That would be where they’d put it. Probably extract their niter from the dung of their horses and cows. Sulfur probably from coal-mine drainage. Jim, this is really something!”</p>
			<p>“I hope they don’t cut loose on us with that thing,” Loudons said, looking apprehensively at the brass-rimmed black muzzle that was covering them from the belfry. “I wonder if we ought to⁠—Oh-oh, here they come!”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Three or four young men stepped out of the wide door of the old church. They wore fringed buckskin trousers and buckskin shirts and odd caps of deerskin with visors to shade their eyes and similar beaks behind to protect the neck. They had powder horns and bullet pouches slung over their shoulders, and long rifles in their hands. They stepped aside as soon as they were out; carefully avoiding any gesture of menace, they stood watching the helicopter which had landed among them.</p>
			<p>Three other men followed them out; they, too, wore buckskins, and the odd double-visored caps. One had a close-cropped white beard, and on the shoulders of his buckskin shirt he wore the single silver bars of a first lieutenant of the vanished United States Army. He had a pistol on his belt; it had the saw-handle grip of an automatic, but it was a flintlock, as were the rifles of the young men who stood watchfully on either side of the two middle-aged men who accompanied him. The whole party advanced toward the helicopter.</p>
			<p>“All right; come on, Monty.” Loudons opened the door and let down the steps. Picking up an auto-carbine, he slung it and stepped out of the helicopter, Altamont behind him. They advanced to meet the party from the old church, halting when they were about twenty feet apart.</p>
			<p>“I must apologize, lieutenant, for dropping in on you so unceremoniously.” He stopped, wondering if the man with the white beard understood a word of what he was saying.</p>
			<p>“The natural way to come in, when you travel in the air,” the old man replied. “At least, you came in openly. I can promise you a better reception than you got at that city to the west of us a couple of days ago.”</p>
			<p>“Now how did you know we’d had trouble at Cincinnati day-before-yesterday?” Loudons demanded.</p>
			<p>The old man’s eyes sparkled with childlike pleasure. “That surprises you, my dear sir? In a moment, I daresay you’ll be amazed at the simplicity of it. You have a nasty rip in the left leg of your trousers, and the cloth around it is stained with blood. Through the rip, I perceive a bandage. Obviously, you have suffered a recent wound. I further observe that the side of your flying machine bears recent scratches, as though from the spears or throwing-hatchets of the Scowrers. Evidently they attacked you as you were leaving it; it is fortunate that these cannibal devils are too stupid and too anxious for human flesh to exercise patience.”</p>
			<p>“Well, that explains how you knew we’d been recently attacked,” Loudons told him. “But how did you guess that it had been to the west of here, in a ruined city?”</p>
			<p>“I never guess,” the oldster with the silver bar and the keystone-shaped red patch on his left shoulder replied. “It is a shocking habit⁠—destructive to the logical faculty. What seems strange to you is only so because you do not follow my train of thought. For example, the wheels and their framework under your flying machine are splashed with mud which seems to be predominantly brick-dust, mixed with plaster. Obviously, you landed recently in a dead city, either during or after a rain. There was a rain here yesterday evening, the wind being from the west. Obviously, you followed behind the rain as it came up the river. And now that I look at your boots, I see traces of the same sort of mud, around the soles and in front of the heels. But this is heartless of us, keeping you standing here on a wounded leg, sir. Come in, and let our medic look at it.”</p>
			<p>“Well, thank you, lieutenant,” Loudons replied. “But don’t bother your medic; I’ve attended to the wound myself, and it wasn’t serious to begin with.”</p>
			<p>“You are a doctor?” the white-bearded man asked.</p>
			<p>“Of sorts. A sort of general scientist. My name is Loudons. My friend, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Altamont, here, is a scientist, also.”</p>
			<p>There was an immediate reaction; all three of the elders of the village, and the young riflemen who had accompanied them, exchanged glances of surprise. Loudons dropped his hand to the grip of his slung auto-carbine, and Altamont sidled unobtrusively away from him, his hand moving as by accident toward the butt of his pistol. The same thought was in both men’s minds, that these people might feel, as a heritage of the war of two centuries ago, a hostility to science and scientists. There was no hostility, however, in their manner as the old man advanced and held out his hand.</p>
			<p>“I am Tenant Mycroft Jones, the Toon Leader here,” he said. “This is Stamford Rawson, our Reader, and Verner Hughes, our Toon Sarge. This is his son, Murray Hughes, the Toon Sarge of the Irregulars. But come into the Aitch-Cue House, gentlemen. We have much to talk about.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>By this time, the villagers had begun to emerge from the log cabins and rubble-walled houses around the plaza and the old church. Some of them, mostly young men, were carrying rifles, but the majority of them were unarmed. About half of them were women, in short deerskin or homespun dresses; there were a number of children, the younger ones almost completely naked.</p>
			<p>“Sarge,” the old man told one of the youths, “post a guard over this flying machine; don’t let anybody meddle with it. And have all the noncoms and techs report here, on the double.” He turned and shouted up at the truncated steeple: “Atherton, sound ‘All Clear!’ ”</p>
			<p>A horn, up in the belfry, began blowing, to advise the people who had run from the fields into the woods that there was no danger.</p>
			<p>They went through the open doorway of the old stone church, and entered the big room inside. The building had evidently been gutted by fire, two centuries before, and portions of the wall had been restored. Now there was a rough plank floor, and a plank ceiling at about twelve feet; the room was apparently used as a community center. There were a number of benches and chairs, all very neatly made, and along one wall, out of the way, ten or fifteen long tables had been stacked, the tops in a pile and the trestles on them. The walls were decorated with trophies of weapons⁠—a number of old M-12 rifles and M-16 submachine guns, all in good clean condition, a light machine rifle, two bazookas. Among them were stone and metal-tipped spears and crude hatchets and knives and clubs, the work of the wild men of the woods. A stairway led to the second floor, and it was up this that the man who bore the title of Toon Leader conducted them, to a small room furnished with a long table, a number of chairs, and several big wooden chests bound with iron.</p>
			<p>“Sit down, gentlemen,” the Toon Leader invited, going to a cupboard and producing a large bottle stopped with a corncob and a number of small cups. “It’s a little early in the day,” he said, “but this is a very special occasion. You smoke a pipe, I take it?” he asked Altamont. “Then try some of this; of our own growth and curing.” He extended a doeskin moccasin, which seemed to be the tobacco-container.</p>
			<p>Altamont looked at the thing dubiously, then filled his pipe from it. The oldster drew his pistol, pushed a little wooden plug into the vent, added some tow to the priming, and, aiming at the wall, snapped it. Evidently, at times the formality of plugging the vent had been overlooked; there were a number of holes in the wall there. This time, however, the pistol didn’t go off. He shook out the smoldering tow, blew it into flame, and lit a candle from it, offering the light to Altamont. Loudons got out a cigar and lit it from the candle; the others filled and lighted pipes. The Toon Leader reprimed his pistol, then holstered it, took off his belt and laid it aside, an example the others followed.</p>
			<p>They drank ceremoniously, and then seated themselves at the table. As they did, two more men came into the room; they were introduced as Alexander Barrett, the gunsmith, and Stanley Markovitch, the distiller.</p>
			<p>“You come, then, from the west?” the Toon Leader began by asking.</p>
			<p>“Are you from Utah?” the gunsmith interrupted, suspiciously.</p>
			<p>“Why, no; we’re from Arizona. A place called Fort Ridgeway,” Loudons said.</p>
			<p>The others nodded, in the manner of people who wish to conceal ignorance; it was obvious that none of them had ever heard of Fort Ridgeway, or Arizona either.</p>
			<p>“We’ve been in what used to be Utah,” Altamont said. “There’s nobody there but a few Indians, and a few whites who are even less civilized.”</p>
			<p>“You say you come from a fort? Then the wars aren’t over, yet?” Sarge Hughes asked.</p>
			<p>“The wars have been over for a long time. You know how terrible they were. You know how few in all the country were left alive,” Loudons said.</p>
			<p>“None that we know of, beside ourselves and the Scowrers until you came,” the Toon Leader said.</p>
			<p>“We have found only a few small groups, in the whole country, who have managed to save anything of the Old Times. Most of them lived in little villages and cultivated land. A few had horses, or cows. None, that we have ever found before, made guns and powder for themselves. But they remembered that they were men, and did not eat one another. Whenever we find a group of people like this, we try to persuade them to let us help them.”</p>
			<p>“Why?” the Toon Leader asked. “Why do you do this for people you’ve never met before? What do you want from them⁠—from us⁠—in return for your help?” He was speaking to Altamont, rather than to Loudons; it seemed obvious that he believed Altamont to be the leader and Loudons the subordinate.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Because we’re trying to bring back the best things of the Old Times,” Altamont told him. “Look; you’ve had troubles, here. So have we, many times. Years when the crops failed; years of storms, or floods; troubles with these beast-men in the woods. And you were alone, as we were, with no one to help. We want to put all men who are still men in touch with one another, so that they can help each other in trouble, and work together. If this isn’t done soon, everything which makes men different from beasts will soon be no more.”</p>
			<p>“He’s right. One of us, alone, is helpless,” the Reader said. “It is only in the Toon that there is strength. He wants to organize a Toon of all Toons.”</p>
			<p>“That’s about it. We are beginning to make helicopters like the one Loudons and I came here in. We’ll furnish your community with one or more of them. We can give you a radio, so that you can communicate with other communities. We can give you rifles and machine guns and ammunition, to fight the⁠ ⁠… the Scowrers, did you call them? And we can give you atomic engines, so that you can build machines for yourselves.”</p>
			<p>“Some of our people⁠—Alex Barrett, here, the gunsmith, and Stan Markovitch, the distiller, and Harrison Grant, the iron worker⁠—get their living by making things. How’d they make out, after your machines came in here?” Verner Hughes asked.</p>
			<p>“We’ve thought of that; we had that problem with other groups we’ve helped,” Loudons said. “In some communities, everybody owns everything in common; we don’t have much of a problem, there. Is that the way you do it, here?”</p>
			<p>“Well, no. If a man makes a thing, or digs it out of the ruins, or catches it in the woods, it’s his.”</p>
			<p>“Then we’ll work out some way. Give the machines to the people who are already in a trade, or something like that. We’ll have to talk it over with you and with the people who’d be concerned.”</p>
			<p>“How is it you took so long finding us,” Alex Barrett asked. “It’s been two hundred or so years since the Wars.”</p>
			<p>“Alex! You see but you do not observe!” The Toon Leader rebuked. “These people have their flying machines, which are highly complicated mechanisms. They would have to make tools and machines to make them, and tools and machines to make those tools and machines. They would have to find materials, often going far in search of them. The marvel is not that they took so long, but that they did it so quickly.”</p>
			<p>“That’s right,” Altamont said. “Originally, Fort Ridgeway was a military research and development center. As the country became disorganized, the Government set this project up, to develop ways of improvising power and transportation and communication methods and extracting raw materials. If they’d had a little more time, they might have saved the country. As it was, they were able to keep themselves alive and keep something like civilization going at the Fort, while the whole country was breaking apart around them. Then, when the rockets stopped falling, they started to rebuild. Fortunately, more than half the technicians at the Fort were women; there was no question of them dying out. But it’s only been in the last twenty years that we’ve been able to make nuclear-electric engines, and this is the first time any of us have gotten east of the Mississippi.”</p>
			<p>“How did your group manage to survive?” Loudons said. “You call it the Toon; I suppose that’s what the word platoon has become, with time. You were, originally, a military platoon?”</p>
			<p>“<em>Pla</em>-toon!” the white-bearded man said. “Of all the unpardonable stupidity! Of course that was what it was. And the title, Tenant, was originally <em>lieu</em>-tenant; I know that, though we have all dropped the first part of the word. That should have led me, if I’d used my wits, to deduce platoon from toon.</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir. We were originally a platoon of soldiers, two hundred years ago, at the time when the Wars ended. The Old Toon, and the First Tenant, were guarding pows, whatever they were. The pows were all killed by a big bomb, and the First Tenant, Lieutenant Gilbert Dunbar, took his⁠ ⁠… his platoon and started to march to Deecee, where the Government was, but there was no Government, any more. They fought with the people along the way. When they needed food, or ammunition, or animals to pull their wagons, they took them, and killed those who tried to prevent them. Other people joined the Toon, and when they found women whom they wanted, they took them. They did all sorts of things that would have been crimes if there had been any law, but since there was no law any longer, it was obvious that there could be no crime. The First Ten⁠—Lieutenant⁠—kept his men together, because he had The Books. Each evening, at the end of each day’s march, he read to his men out of them.</p>
			<p>“Finally, they came here. There had been a town here, but it had been burned and destroyed, and there were people camping in the ruins. Some of them fought and were killed; others came in and joined the platoon. At first, they built shelters around this building, and made this their fort. Then they cleared away the ruins, and built new houses. When the cartridges for the rifles began to get scarce, they began to make gunpowder, and new rifles, like these we are using now, to shoot without cartridges. Lieutenant Dunbar did this out of his own knowledge, because there is nothing in The Books about making gunpowder; the guns in The Books are rifles and shotguns and revolvers and airguns; except for the airguns, which we haven’t been able to make, these all shot cartridges. As with your people, we did not die out, because we had women. Neither did we increase greatly⁠—too many died or were killed young. But several times we’ve had to tear down the wall and rebuild it, to make room inside it for more houses, and we’ve been clearing a little more land for fields each year. We still read and follow the teachings of The Books; we have made laws for ourselves out of them.”</p>
			<p>“And we are waiting here, for the Slain and Risen One,” Tenant Jones added, looking at Altamont intently. “It is impossible that He will not, sooner or later, deduce the existence of this community. If He has not done so already.”</p>
			<p>“Well, sir,” the Toon Leader changed the subject abruptly, “enough of this talk about the past. If I understand rightly, it is the future in which you gentlemen are interested.” He pushed back the cuff of his hunting shirt and looked at an old and worn wrist watch. “Eleven-hundred; we’ll have lunch shortly. This afternoon, you will meet the other people of the Toon, and this evening, at eighteen-hundred, we’ll have a mess together outdoors. Then, when we have everybody together, we can talk over your offer to help us, and decide what it is that you can give us that we can use.”</p>
			<p>“You spoke, a while ago, of what you could do for us, in return,” Altamont said. “There’s one thing you can do, no further away than tomorrow, if you’re willing.”</p>
			<p>“And that is⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“In Pittsburgh, somewhere, there is an underground crypt, full of books. Not bound and printed books; spools of microfilm. You know what that is?”</p>
			<p>The others shook their heads. Altamont continued:</p>
			<p>“They are spools on which strips are wound, on which pictures have been taken of books, page by page. We can make other, larger pictures from them, big enough to be read⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Oh, photographs, which you enlarge. I understand that. You mean, you can make many copies of them?”</p>
			<p>“That’s right. And you shall have copies, as soon as we can take the originals back to Fort Ridgeway, where we have equipment for enlarging them. But while we have information which will help us to find the crypt where the books are, we will need help in getting it open.”</p>
			<p>“Of course! This is wonderful. Copies of The Books!” the Reader exclaimed. “We thought we had the only one left in the world!”</p>
			<p>“Not just The Books, Stamford; other books,” the Toon Leader told him. “The books which are mentioned in The Books. But of course we will help you. You have a map to show where they are?”</p>
			<p>“Not a map; just some information. But we can work out the location of the crypt.”</p>
			<p>“A ritual,” Stamford Rawson said happily. “Of course.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>They lunched together at the house of Toon Sarge Hughes with the Toon Leader and the Reader and five or six of the leaders of the community. The food was plentiful, but Altamont found himself wishing that the first book they found in the Carnegie Library crypt would be a cook book.</p>
			<p>In the afternoon, he and Loudons separated. The latter attached himself to the Tenant, the Reader, and an old woman, Irene Klein, who was almost a hundred years old and was the repository and arbiter of most of the community’s oral legends. Altamont, on the other hand, started, with Alex Barrett, the gunsmith, and Mordecai Ricci, the miller, to inspect the gunshop and grist mill. Joined by half a dozen more of the village craftsmen, they visited the forge and foundry, the sawmill, the wagon shop. Altamont looked at the flume, a rough structure of logs lined with sheet aluminum, and at the nitriary, a shed-roofed pit in which potassium nitrate was extracted from the community’s animal refuse. Then, loading his guides into the helicopter, they took off for a visit to the powder mill on the island and a trip up the river.</p>
			<p>They were a badly scared lot, for the first few minutes, as they watched the ground receding under them through the transparent plastic nose. Then, when nothing disastrous seemed to be happening, exhilaration took the place of fear, and by the time they set down on the tip of the island, the eight men were confirmed aviation enthusiasts. The trip upriver was an even bigger success; the high point came when Altamont set his controls for “Hover,” pointed out a snarl of driftwood in the stream, and allowed his passengers to fire one of the machine guns at it. The lead balls of their own black-powder rifles would have plunked into the waterlogged wood without visible effect; the copper-jacketed machine-gun bullets ripped it to splinters. They returned for a final visit to the distillery awed by what they had seen.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Monty, I don’t know what the devil to make of this crowd,” Loudons said, that evening, after the feast, when they had entered the helicopter and prepared to retire. “We’ve run into some weird communities⁠—that lot down in Old Mexico who live in the church and claim they have a divine mission to redeem the world by prayer, fasting and flagellation, or those yogis in Los Angeles⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Or the Blackout Boys in Detroit,” Altamont added.</p>
			<p>“That’s understandable,” Loudons said, “after what their ancestors went through in the Last War. But this crowd, here! The descendants of an old United States Army infantry platoon, with a fully developed religion centered on a slain and resurrected god⁠—Normally, it would take thousands of years for a slain-god religion to develop, and then only from the field-fertility magic of primitive agriculturists. Well, you saw these people’s fields from the air. Some of the members of that old platoon were men who knew the latest methods of scientific farming; they didn’t need naive fairy tales about the planting and germination of seed.”</p>
			<p>“Sure this religion isn’t just a variant of Christianity?”</p>
			<p>“Absolutely not. In the first place, these Sacred Books can’t be the Bible⁠—you heard Tenant Jones say that they mentioned firearms that used cartridges. That means that they can’t be older than 1860 at the very earliest. And in the second place, this slain god wasn’t crucified or put to death by any form of execution; he perished, together with his enemy, in combat, and both god and devil were later resurrected. The Enemy is supposed to be the master mind back of these cannibal savages in the woods and also in the ruins.”</p>
			<p>“Did you get a look at these Sacred Books, or find out what they might be?”</p>
			<p>Loudons shook his head disgustedly. “Every time I brought up the question, they evaded. The Tenant sent the Reader out to bring in this old lady, Irene Klein⁠—she was a perfect gold mine of information about the history and traditions of the Toon, by the way⁠—and then he sent him out on some other errand, undoubtedly to pass the word not to talk to us about their religion.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t get that,” Altamont said. “They showed me everything they had⁠—their gunshop, their powder mill, their defenses, everything.” He smoked in silence for a moment. “Say, this slain god couldn’t be the original platoon commander, could he?”</p>
			<p>“No. They have the greatest respect for his memory⁠—decorate his grave regularly, drink toasts to him⁠—but he hasn’t been deified. They got the idea for this deity of theirs out of the Sacred Books.” Loudons gnawed the end of his cigar and frowned. “Monty, this has me worried like the devil, because I believe that they suspect that you are the Slain and Risen One.”</p>
			<p>“Could be, at that. I know the Tenant came up to me, very respectfully, and said, ‘I hope you don’t think, sir, that I was presumptuous in trying to display my humble deductive abilities to <em>you</em>.’ ”</p>
			<p>“What did you say?” Loudons demanded rather sharply.</p>
			<p>“Told him certainly not; that he’d used a good quick method of demonstrating that he and his people weren’t like those mindless subhumans in the woods.”</p>
			<p>“That was all right. I don’t know how we’re going to handle this. They only suspect that you are their deity. As it stands, now, we’re on trial, here. And I get the impression that logic, not faith, seems to be their supreme religious virtue; that skepticism is a religious obligation instead of a sin. That’s something else that’s practically unheard of. I wish I knew⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Tenant Mycroft Jones, and Reader Stamford Rawson and Toon Sarge Verner Hughes, and his son Murray Hughes, sat around the bare-topped table in the room, on the second floor of the Aitch-Cue House. A lighted candle flickered in the cool breeze that came in through the open window throwing their shadows back and forth on the walls.</p>
			<p>“Pass the tantalus, Murray,” the Tenant said, and the youngest of the four handed the corncob-corked bottle to the eldest. Tenant Jones filled his cup, and then sat staring at it, while Verner Hughes thrust his pipe into the toe of the moccasin and filled it. Finally, he drank about half of the clear wild-plum brandy.</p>
			<p>“Gentlemen, I am baffled,” he confessed. “We have three alternate possibilities here, and we dare not disregard any of them. Either this man who calls himself Altamont is truly He, or he is merely what we are asked to believe, one of a community like ours, with more of the old knowledge than we possess.”</p>
			<p>“You know my views,” Verner Hughes said. “I cannot believe that He was more than a man, as we are. A great, a good, a wise man, but a man and mortal.”</p>
			<p>“Let’s not go into that, now.” The Reader emptied his cup and took the bottle, filling it again. “You know my views, too. I hold that He is no longer upon earth in the flesh, but lives in the spirit and is only with us in the spirit. There are three possibilities, too, none of which can be eliminated. But what was your third possibility, Tenant?”</p>
			<p>“That they are creatures of the Enemy. Perhaps that one or the other of them <em>is</em> the Enemy.”</p>
			<p>Reader Rawson, lifting his cup to his lips, almost strangled. The Hugheses, father and son, stared at Tenant Jones in horror.</p>
			<p>“The Enemy⁠—with such weapons and resources!” Murray Hughes gasped. Then he emptied his cup and refilled it. “No! I can’t believe that; he’d have struck before this and wiped us all out!”</p>
			<p>“Not necessarily, Murray,” the Tenant replied. “Until he became convinced that his agents, the Scowrers, could do nothing against us, he would bide his time. He sits motionless, like a spider, at the center of the web; he does little himself; his agents are numerous. Or, perhaps, he wishes to recruit us into his hellish organization.”</p>
			<p>“It is a possibility,” Reader Rawson admitted. “One which we can neither accept nor reject safely. And we must learn the truth as soon as possible. If this man is really He, we must not spurn Him on mere suspicion. If he is a man, come to help us, we must accept his help; if he is speaking the truth, the people who sent him could do wonders for us, and the greatest wonder would be to make us, again, a part of a civilized community. And if he is the Enemy⁠—”</p>
			<p>“If it is really He,” Murray said, “I think we are on trial.”</p>
			<p>“What do you mean, son? Oh, I see. Of course, I don’t believe he is, but that’s mere doubt, not negative certainty. But if I’m wrong, if this man is truly He, we are being tested. He has come among us incognito; if we are worthy of Him, we will penetrate His disguise.”</p>
			<p>“A very pretty problem, gentlemen,” the Tenant said, smacking his lips over his brandy. “For all that it may be a deadly serious one for us. There is, of course, nothing that we can do tonight. But tomorrow, we have promised to help our visitors, whoever they may be, in searching for this crypt in the city. Murray, you were to be in charge of the detail that was to accompany them. Carry on as arranged, and say nothing of our suspicions, but advise your men to keep a sharp watch on the strangers, that they may learn all they can from them. Stamford, you and Verner and I will go along. We should, if we have any wits at all, observe something.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Listen to this infernal thing!” Altamont raged. “<q>Wielding a gold-plated spade handled with oak from an original rafter of the Congressional Library, at three-fifteen one afternoon last week⁠—</q> One afternoon last week!” He cursed luridly. “Why couldn’t that blasted magazine say <em>what</em> afternoon? I’ve gone over a lot of twentieth century copies of that magazine; that expression was a regular cliché with them.”</p>
			<p>Loudons looked over his shoulder at the photostated magazine page.</p>
			<p>“Well, we know it was between June thirteen and nineteen, inclusive,” he said. “And there’s a picture of the university president, complete with gold-plated spade, breaking ground. Call it Wednesday, the sixteenth. Over there’s the tip of the shadow of the old Cathedral of Learning, about a hundred yards away. There are so many inexactitudes that one’ll probably cancel out another.”</p>
			<p>“That’s so, and it’s also pretty futile getting angry at somebody who’s been dead two hundred years, but why couldn’t they say Wednesday, or Monday, or Saturday, or whatever?” He checked back in the astronomical handbook, and the photostated pages of the old almanac, and looked over his calculations. “All right, here’s the angle of the shadow, and the compass-bearing. I had a look, yesterday, when I was taking the local citizenry on that junket. The old baseball diamond at Forbes Field is plainly visible, and I located the ruins of the Cathedral of Learning from that. Here’s the above-sea-level altitude of the top of the tower. After you’ve landed us, go up to this altitude⁠—use the barometric altimeter, not the radar⁠—and hold position.”</p>
			<p>Loudons leaned forward from the desk to the contraption Altamont had rigged in the nose of the helicopter⁠—one of the telescope-sighted hunting rifles clamped in a vise, with a compass and a spirit-level under it.</p>
			<p>“Rifle’s pointing downward at the correct angle now?” he asked. “Good. Then all I have to do is hold the helicopter steady, keep it at the right altitude, level, and pointed in the right direction, and watch through the sight while you move the flag around, and direct you by radio. Why wasn’t I born quintuplets?”</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Altamont! <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Loudons!” a voice outside the helicopter called. “Are you ready for us, now?”</p>
			<p>Altamont went to the open door and looked out. The old Toon Leader, the Reader, Toon Sarge Hughes, his son, and four young men in buckskins with slung rifles, were standing outside.</p>
			<p>“I have decided,” the Tenant said, “that <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Rawson and Sarge Hughes and I would be of more help than an equal number of younger men. We may not be as active, but we know the old ruins better, especially the paths and hiding places of the Scowrers. These four young men you probably met last evening; it will do no harm to introduce them again. Birdy Edwards; Sholto Jiminez; Jefferson Burns; Murdo Olsen.”</p>
			<p>“Very pleased, Tenant, gentlemen. I met all you young men last evening; I remember you,” Altamont said. “Now, if you’ll all crowd in here, I’ll explain what we’re going to try to do.”</p>
			<p>He showed them the old picture. “You see where the shadow of a tall building falls?” he asked. “We know the location and height of this building. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Loudons will hold this helicopter at exactly the position of the top of the building, and aim through the sights of the rifle, there. One of you will have this flag in his hand, and will move it back and forth; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Loudons will tell us when the flag is in the sight of the rifle.”</p>
			<p>“He’ll need a good pair of lungs to do that,” Verner Hughes commented.</p>
			<p>“We’ll use radio. A portable set on the ground, and the helicopter’s radio set.” He was met, to his surprise, with looks of incomprehension. He had not supposed that these people would have lost all memory of radio communication.</p>
			<p>“Why, that’s wonderful!” the Reader exclaimed, when he explained. “You can talk directly; how much better than just sending a telegram!”</p>
			<p>“But, finding the crypt by the shadow; that’s exactly like the⁠—” Murray Hughes began, then stopped short. Immediately, he began talking loudly about the rifle that was to be used as a surveying transit, comparing it with the ones in the big first-floor room at the Aitch-Cue House.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Locating the point on which the shadow of the old Cathedral of Learning had fallen proved easier than either Altamont or Loudons had expected. The towering building was now a tumbled mass of slagged rubble, but it was quite possible to determine its original center, and with the old data from the excellent reference library at Fort Ridgeway, its height above sea level was known. After a little jockeying, the helicopter came to a hovering stop, and the slanting barrel of the rifle in the vise pointed downward along the line of the shadow that had been cast on that afternoon in June, 1993, the cross hairs of the scope-sight centered almost exactly on the spot Altamont had estimated on the map. While he peered through the sight, Loudons brought the helicopter slanting down to land on the sheet of fused glass that had once been a grassy campus.</p>
			<p>“Well, this is probably it,” Altamont said. “We didn’t have to bother fussing around with that flag, after all. That hump, over there, looks as though it had been a small building, and there’s nothing corresponding to it on the city map. That may be the bunker over the stairhead to the crypt.”</p>
			<p>They began unloading equipment⁠—a small portable nuclear-electric conversion unit, a powerful solenoid-hammer, crowbars and intrenching tools, tins of blasting-plastic. They took out the two hunting rifles, and the auto-carbines, and Altamont showed the young men of Murray Hughes’ detail how to use them.</p>
			<p>“If you’ll pardon me, sir,” the Tenant said to Altamont, “I think it would be a good idea if your companion went up in the flying machine and circled around over us, to keep watch for Scowrers. There are quite a few of them, particularly farther up the rivers, to the east, where the damage was not so great and they can find cellars and shelters and buildings to live in.”</p>
			<p>“Good idea; that way, we won’t have to put out guards,” Altamont said. “From the looks of this, we’ll need everybody to help dig into that thing. Hand out one of the portable radios, Jim, and go up to about a thousand feet. If you see anything suspicious, give us a yell, and then spray it with bullets, and find out what it is afterward.”</p>
			<p>They waited until the helicopter had climbed to position and was circling above, and then turned their attention to the place where the sheet of fused earth and stone bulged upward. It must have been almost ground-zero of one of the hydrogen-bombs; the wreckage of the Cathedral of Learning had fallen predominantly to the north, and the Carnegie Library was tumbled to the east.</p>
			<p>“I think the entrance would be on this side, toward the Library,” Altamont said. “Let’s try it, to begin with.”</p>
			<p>He used the solenoid-hammer, slowly pounding a hole into the glaze, and placed a small charge of the plastic explosive. Chunks of the lavalike stuff pelted down between the little mound and the huge one of the old library, blowing a hole six feet in diameter and two and a half deep, revealing concrete bonded with crushed steel-mill slag.</p>
			<p>“We missed the door,” he said. “That means we’ll have to tunnel in through who knows how much concrete. Well⁠—”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>He used a second and larger charge, after digging a hole a foot deep. When he and his helpers came up to look, they found a large mass of concrete blown out, and solid steel behind it. Altamont cut two more holes sidewise, one on either side of the blown-out place, and fired a charge in each of them, bringing down more concrete. He found that he hadn’t missed the door, after all. It had merely been concreted over.</p>
			<p>A few more shots cleared it, and after some work, they got it open. There was a room inside, concrete-floored and entirely empty. With the others crowding behind him, Altamont stood in the doorway and inspected the interior with his flashlight; he heard somebody back of him say something about a most peculiar sort of a dark-lantern. Across the small room, on the opposite wall, was a bronze plaque.</p>
			<p>It carried quite a lengthy inscription, including the names of all the persons and institutions participating in the microfilm project. The History Department at the Fort would be most interested in that, but the only thing that interested Altamont was the statement that the floor had been laid over the trapdoor leading to the vaults where the microfilms were stored. He went outside to the radio.</p>
			<p>“Hello, Jim. We’re inside, but the films are stored in an underground vault, and we have to tear up a concrete floor,” he said. “Go back to the village and gather up all the men you can carry, and tools. Hammers and picks and short steel bars. I don’t want to use explosives inside. The interior of the crypt oughtn’t to be damaged, and I don’t know what a blast in here might do to the film, and I don’t want to take chances.”</p>
			<p>“No, of course not. How thick do you think this floor is?”</p>
			<p>“Haven’t the least idea. Plenty thick, I’d say. Those films would have to be well buried, to shield them from radioactivity. We can expect that it’ll take some time.”</p>
			<p>“All right. I’ll be back as soon as I can.”</p>
			<p>The helicopter turned and went windmilling away, over what had been the Golden Triangle, down the Ohio.</p>
			<p>Altamont went back to the little concrete bunker and sat down, lighting his pipe. Murray Hughes and his four riflemen spread out, one circling around the glazed butte that had been the Cathedral of Learning, another climbing to the top of the old library, and the others taking positions to the south and east.</p>
			<p>Altamont sat in silence, smoking his pipe and trying to form some conception of the wealth under that concrete floor. It was no use. Jim Loudons probably understood a little more nearly what those books would mean to the world of today, and what they could do toward shaping the world of the future. There was a library at Fort Ridgeway, and it was an excellent one⁠—for its purpose. In 1996, when the rockets had come crashing down, it had contained the cream of the world’s technological knowledge⁠—and very little else. There was a little fiction, a few books of ideas, just enough to give the survivors a tantalizing glimpse of the world of their fathers. But now⁠—</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>A rifle banged to the south and east, and banged again. Either Murray Hughes or Birdy Edwards⁠—it was one of the two hunting rifles from the helicopter. On the heels of the reports, they heard a voice shouting: “Scowrers! A lot of them, coming from up the river!” A moment later, there was a light whip-crack of one of the long muzzle-loaders, from the top of the old Carnegie Library, and Altamont could see a wisp of gray-white smoke drifting away from where it had been fired. He jumped to his feet and raced for the radio, picking it up and bringing it to the bunker.</p>
			<p>Tenant Jones, old Reader Rawson, and Verner Hughes had caught up their rifles. The Tenant was shouting, “Come on in! Everybody, come in!” The boy on top of the library began scrambling down. Another came running from the direction of the half-demolished Cathedral of Learning, a third from the baseball field that had served as Altamont’s point of reference the afternoon before. The fourth, Murray Hughes, was running in from the ruins of the old Carnegie Tech buildings, and Birdy Edwards sped up the main road from Shenley Park. Once or twice, as he ran, Murray Hughes paused, turned, and fired behind him.</p>
			<p>Then his pursuers came into sight. They ran erect, and they wore a few rags of skin garments, and they carried spears and hatchets and clubs, so they were probably classifiable as men. Their hair was long and unkempt; their bodies were almost black with dirt and from the sun. A few of them were yelling; most of them ran silently. They ran more swiftly than the boy they were pursuing; the distance between them narrowed every moment. There were at least fifty of them.</p>
			<p>Verner Hughes’ rifle barked; one of them dropped. As coolly as though he were shooting squirrels instead of his son’s pursuers, he dropped the butt of his rifle to the ground, poured a charge of powder, patched a ball and rammed it home, replaced the ramrod. Tenant Jones fired then, and then Birdy Edwards joined them and began shooting with the telescope-sighted hunting rifle. The young man who had been north of the Cathedral of Learning had one of the auto-carbines; Altamont had providently set the fire-control for semi-auto before giving it to him. He dropped to one knee and began to empty the clip, shooting slowly and deliberately, picking off the runners who were in the lead. The boy who had started to climb down off the library halted, fired his flintlock, and began reloading it. And Altamont, sitting down and propping his elbows on his knees, took both hands to the automatic which was his only weapon, emptying the magazine and replacing it. The last three of the savages he shot in the back; they had had enough and were running for their lives.</p>
			<p>So far, everybody was safe. The boy in the library came down through a place where the wall had fallen. Murray Hughes stopped running and came slowly toward the bunker, putting a fresh clip into his rifle. The others came drifting in.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Altamont, calling Loudons,” the scientist from Fort Ridgeway was saying into the radio. “Monty to Jim; can you hear me, Jim?”</p>
			<p>Silence.</p>
			<p>“We’d better get ready for another attack,” Birdy Edwards said. “There’s another gang coming from down that way. I never saw so many Scowrers!”</p>
			<p>“Maybe there’s a reason, Birdy,” Tenant Jones said. “The Enemy is after big game, this time.”</p>
			<p>“Jim! Where the devil are you?” Altamont fairly yelled into the radio, and as he did, he knew the answer. Loudons was in the village, away from the helicopter, gathering tools and workers. Nothing to do but keep on trying.</p>
			<p>“Here they come!” Reader Rawson warned.</p>
			<p>“How far can these rifles be depended on?” Birdy Edwards wanted to know.</p>
			<p>Altamont straightened, saw the second band of savages approaching, about four hundred yards away.</p>
			<p>“Start shooting now,” he said. “Aim for the upper part of their bodies.”</p>
			<p>The two autoloading rifles began to crack. After a few shots, the savages took cover. Evidently they understood the capabilities and limitations of the villagers’ flintlocks; this was a terrifying surprise to them.</p>
			<p>“Jim!” Altamont was almost praying into the radio. “Come in, Jim!”</p>
			<p>“What is it, Monty? I was outside.”</p>
			<p>Altamont told him.</p>
			<p>“Those fellows you had up with you yesterday; think they could be trusted to handle the guns? A couple of them are here with me,” Loudons inquired.</p>
			<p>“Take a chance on it; it won’t cost you anything but my life, and that’s not worth much at present.”</p>
			<p>“All right; hold on. We’ll be along in a few minutes.”</p>
			<p>“Loudons is bringing the helicopter,” he told the others. “All we have to do is hold on, here, till he comes.”</p>
			<p>A naked savage raised his head from behind what might, two hundred years ago, have been a cement park-bench, a hundred yards away. Reader Stamford Rawson promptly killed him and began reloading.</p>
			<p>“I think you’re right, Tenant,” he said. “The Scowrers have never attacked in bands like this before. They must have had a powerful reason, and I can think of only one.”</p>
			<p>“That’s what I’m beginning to think, too,” Verner Hughes agreed. “At least, we have eliminated the third of your possibilities, Tenant. And I think probably the second, as well.”</p>
			<p>Altamont wondered what they were double-talking about. There wasn’t any particular mystery about the mass attack of the wild men to him. Debased as they were, they still possessed speech and the ability to transmit experiences. No matter how beclouded in superstition, they still remembered that aircraft dropped bombs, and bombs killed people, and where people had been killed, they would find fresh meat. They had seen the helicopter circling about, and had heard the blasting; everyone in the area had been drawn to the scene as soon as Loudons had gone down the river.</p>
			<p>Maybe they had forgotten that aircraft also carried guns. At least, when they sprang to their feet and started to run at the return of the helicopter, many did not run far.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Altamont and Loudons shook hands many times in front of the Aitch-Cue House, and listened to many good wishes, and repeated their promise to return. Most of the microfilmed books were still stored in the old church; they were taking away with them only the catalogue and a few of the more important works. Finally, they entered the helicopter. The crowd shouted farewell, as they rose.</p>
			<p>Altamont, at the controls, waited until they had gained five thousand feet, then turned on a compass-course for Colony Three.</p>
			<p>“I can’t wait till we’re in radio-range of the Fort, to report this, Jim,” he said. “Of all the wonderful luck! And I don’t yet know which is more important; finding those books, or finding those people. In a few years, when we can get them supplied with modern equipment and instructed in its use⁠—”</p>
			<p>“I’m not very happy about it, Monty,” Loudons confessed. “I keep thinking about what’s going to happen to them.”</p>
			<p>“Why, nothing’s going to happen to them. They’re going to be given the means of producing more food, keeping more of them alive, having more leisure to develop themselves in⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Monty; I saw the Sacred Books.”</p>
			<p>“The deuce! What were they?”</p>
			<p>“It. One volume; a collection of works. We have it at the Fort; I’ve read it. How I ever missed all the clues⁠—You see Monty, what I’m worried about is what’s going to happen to those people when they find out that we’re not really Sherlock Holmes and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Watson.”</p>

			<h2 epub:type="title">Time and Time Again</h2>
			<p>Blinded by the bomb-flash and numbed by the narcotic injection, he could not estimate the extent of his injuries, but he knew that he was dying. Around him, in the darkness, voices sounded as through a thick wall.</p>
			<p>“They mighta left mosta these Joes where they was. Half of them won’t even last till the truck comes.”</p>
			<p>“No matter; so long as they’re alive, they must be treated,” another voice, crisp and cultivated, rebuked. “Better start taking names, while we’re waiting.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, sir.” Fingers fumbled at his identity badge. “Hartley, Allan; Captain, G5, <abbr>Chem.</abbr> Research AN/73/D. Serial, SO-23869403J.”</p>
			<p>“Allan Hartley!” The medic officer spoke in shocked surprise. “Why, he’s the man who wrote <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Children of the Mist</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rose of Death</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Conqueror’s Road</i>!”</p>
			<p>He tried to speak, and must have stirred; the corpsman’s voice sharpened.</p>
			<p>“Major, I think he’s part conscious. Mebbe I better give him ’nother shot.”</p>
			<p>“Yes, yes; by all means, sergeant.”</p>
			<p>Something jabbed Allan Hartley in the back of the neck. Soft billows of oblivion closed in upon him, and all that remained to him was a tiny spark of awareness, glowing alone and lost in a great darkness.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>The Spark grew brighter. He was more than a something that merely knew that it existed. He was a man, and he had a name, and a military rank, and memories. Memories of the searing blue-green flash, and of what he had been doing outside the shelter the moment before, and memories of the monthlong siege, and of the retreat from the north, and memories of the days before the War, back to the time when he had been little Allan Hartley, a schoolboy, the son of a successful lawyer, in Williamsport, Pennsylvania.</p>
			<p>His mother he could not remember; there was only a vague impression of the house full of people who had tried to comfort him for something he could not understand. But he remembered the old German woman who had kept house for his father, afterward, and he remembered his bedroom, with its chintz-covered chairs, and the warm-colored patch quilt on the old cherry bed, and the tan curtains at the windows, edged with dusky red, and the morning sun shining through them. He could almost see them, now.</p>
			<p>He blinked. He <em>could</em> see them!</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>For a long time, he lay staring at them unbelievingly, and then he deliberately closed his eyes and counted ten seconds, and as he counted, terror gripped him. He was afraid to open them again, lest he find himself blind, or gazing at the filth and wreckage of a blasted city, but when he reached ten, he forced himself to look, and gave a sigh of relief. The sunlit curtains and the sun-gilded mist outside were still there.</p>
			<p>He reached out to check one sense against another, feeling the rough monk’s cloth and the edging of maroon silk thread. They were tangible as well as visible. Then he saw that the back of his hand was unscarred. There should have been a scar, souvenir of a rough-and-tumble brawl of his cub reporter days. He examined both hands closely. An instant later, he had sat up in bed and thrown off the covers, partially removing his pajamas and inspecting as much of his body as was visible.</p>
			<p>It was the smooth body of a little boy.</p>
			<p>That was ridiculous. He was a man of forty-three; an army officer, a chemist, once a best-selling novelist. He had been married, and divorced ten years ago. He looked again at his body. It was only twelve years old. Fourteen, at the very oldest. His eyes swept the room, wide with wonder. Every detail was familiar: the flower-splashed chair covers; the table that served as desk and catchall for his possessions; the dresser, with its mirror stuck full of pictures of aircraft. It was the bedroom of his childhood home. He swung his legs over the edge of the bed. They were six inches too short to reach the floor.</p>
			<p>For an instant, the room spun dizzily; and he was in the grip of utter panic, all confidence in the evidence of his senses lost. Was he insane? Or delirious? Or had the bomb really killed him; was this what death was like? What was that thing, about “ye become as little children”? He started to laugh, and his juvenile larynx made giggling sounds. They seemed funny, too, and aggravated his mirth. For a little while, he was on the edge of hysteria and then, when he managed to control his laughter, he felt calmer. If he were dead, then he must be a discarnate entity, and would be able to penetrate matter. To his relief, he was unable to push his hand through the bed. So he was alive; he was also fully awake, and, he hoped, rational. He rose to his feet and prowled about the room, taking stock of its contents.</p>
			<p>There was no calendar in sight, and he could find no newspapers or dated periodicals, but he knew that it was prior to July 18, 1946. On that day, his fourteenth birthday, his father had given him a light .22 rifle, and it had been hung on a pair of rustic forks on the wall. It was not there now, nor ever had been. On the table, he saw a boys’ book of military aircraft, with a clean, new dustjacket; the flyleaf was inscribed: <q>To Allan Hartley, from his father, on his thirteenth birthday, 7/18/45.</q> Glancing out the window at the foliage on the trees, he estimated the date at late July or early August, 1945; that would make him just thirteen.</p>
			<p>His clothes were draped on a chair beside the bed. Stripping off his pajamas, he donned shorts, then sat down and picked up a pair of lemon-colored socks, which he regarded with disfavor. As he pulled one on, a church bell began to clang. <abbr>St.</abbr> Boniface, up on the hill, ringing for early Mass; so this was Sunday. He paused, the second sock in his hand.</p>
			<p>There was no question that his present environment was actual. Yet, on the other hand, he possessed a set of memories completely at variance with it. Now, suppose, since his environment were not an illusion, everything else were? Suppose all these troublesome memories were no more than a dream? Why, he was just little Allan Hartley, safe in his room on a Sunday morning, badly scared by a nightmare! Too much science fiction, Allan; too many comic books!</p>
			<p>That was a wonderfully comforting thought, and he hugged it to him contentedly. It lasted all the while he was buttoning up his shirt and pulling on his pants, but when he reached for his shoes, it evaporated. Ever since he had wakened, he realized, he had been occupied with thoughts utterly incomprehensible to any thirteen-year-old; even thinking in words that would have been so much Sanskrit to himself at thirteen. He shook his head regretfully. The just-a-dream hypothesis went by the deep six.</p>
			<p>He picked up the second shoe and glared at it as though it were responsible for his predicament. He was going to have to be careful. An unexpected display of adult characteristics might give rise to some questions he would find hard to answer credibly. Fortunately, he was an only child; there would be no brothers or sisters to trip him up. Old <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Stauber, the housekeeper, wouldn’t be much of a problem; even in his normal childhood, he had bulked like an intellectual giant in comparison to her. But his father⁠—</p>
			<p>Now, there the going would be tough. He knew that shrewd attorney’s mind, whetted keen on a generation of lying and reluctant witnesses. Sooner or later, he would forget for an instant and betray himself. Then he smiled, remembering the books he had discovered, in his late ’teens, on his father’s shelves and recalling the character of the openminded agnostic lawyer. If he could only avoid the inevitable unmasking until he had a plausible explanatory theory.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Blake Hartley was leaving the bathroom as Allan Hartley opened his door and stepped into the hall. The lawyer was bare-armed and in slippers; at forty-eight, there was only a faint powdering of gray in his dark hair, and not a gray thread in his clipped mustache. The old Merry Widower, himself, Allan thought, grinning as he remembered the white-haired but still vigorous man from whom he’d parted at the outbreak of the War.</p>
			<p>“Morning, Dad,” he greeted.</p>
			<p>“Morning, son. You’re up early. Going to Sunday school?”</p>
			<p>Now there was the advantage of a father who’d cut his first intellectual tooth on Tom Paine and Bob Ingersoll; attendance at divine services was on a strictly voluntary basis.</p>
			<p>“Why, I don’t think so; I want to do some reading, this morning.”</p>
			<p>“That’s always a good thing to do,” Blake Hartley approved. “After breakfast, suppose you take a walk down to the station and get me a <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Times</i>.” He dug in his trouser pocket and came out with a half dollar. “Get anything you want for yourself, while you’re at it.”</p>
			<p>Allan thanked his father and pocketed the coin.</p>
			<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Stauber’ll still be at Mass,” he suggested. “Say I get the paper now; breakfast won’t be ready till she gets here.”</p>
			<p>“Good idea.” Blake Hartley nodded, pleased. “You’ll have three-quarters of an hour, at least.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>So far, he congratulated himself, everything had gone smoothly. Finishing his toilet, he went downstairs and onto the street, turning left at Brandon to Campbell, and left again in the direction of the station. Before he reached the underpass, a dozen half-forgotten memories had revived. Here was a house that would, in a few years, be gutted by fire. Here were four dwellings standing where he had last seen a five-story apartment building. A gasoline station and a weed-grown lot would shortly be replaced by a supermarket. The environs of the station itself were a complete puzzle to him, until he oriented himself.</p>
			<p>He bought a <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">New York Times</i>, glancing first of all at the date line. <time datetime="1945-08-05">Sunday, August 5, 1945</time>; he’d estimated pretty closely. The battle of Okinawa had been won. The Potsdam Conference had just ended. There were still pictures of the B-25 crash against the Empire State Building, a week ago Saturday. And Japan was still being pounded by bombs from the air and shells from offshore naval guns. Why, tomorrow, Hiroshima was due for the Big Job! It amused him to reflect that he was probably the only person in Williamsport who knew that.</p>
			<p>On the way home, a boy, sitting on the top step of a front porch, hailed him. Allan replied cordially, trying to remember who it was. Of course; Larry Morton! He and Allan had been buddies. They probably had been swimming, or playing Commandos and Germans, the afternoon before. Larry had gone to Cornell the same year that Allan had gone to Penn State; they had both graduated in 1954. Larry had gotten into some Government bureau, and then he had married a Pittsburgh girl, and had become twelfth vice-president of her father’s firm. He had been killed, in 1968, in a plane crash.</p>
			<p>“You gonna Sunday school?” Larry asked, mercifully unaware of the fate Allan foresaw for him.</p>
			<p>“Why, no. I have some things I want to do at home.” He’d have to watch himself. Larry would spot a difference quicker than any adult. “Heck with it,” he added.</p>
			<p>“Golly, I wisht I c’ld stay home from Sunday school whenever I wanted to,” Larry envied. “How about us goin’ swimmin,’ at the Canoe Club, ’safter?”</p>
			<p>Allan thought fast. “Gee, I wisht I c’ld,” he replied, lowering his grammatical sights. “I gotta stay home, ’safter. We’re expectin’ comp’ny; coupla aunts of mine. Dad wants me to stay home when they come.”</p>
			<p>That went over all right. Anybody knew that there was no rational accounting for the vagaries of the adult mind, and no appeal from adult demands. The prospect of company at the Hartley home would keep Larry away, that afternoon. He showed his disappointment.</p>
			<p>“Aw, jeepers creepers!” he blasphemed euphemistically.</p>
			<p>“Mebbe t’morrow,” Allan said. “If I c’n make it. I gotta go, now; ain’t had breakfast yet.” He scuffed his feet boyishly, exchanged so-longs with his friend, and continued homeward.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>As he had hoped, the Sunday paper kept his father occupied at breakfast, to the exclusion of any dangerous table talk. Blake Hartley was still deep in the financial section when Allan left the table and went to the library. There should be two books there to which he wanted badly to refer. For a while, he was afraid that his father had not acquired them prior to 1945, but he finally found them, and carried them onto the front porch, along with a pencil and a ruled yellow scratch pad. In his experienced future⁠—or his past-to-come⁠—Allan Hartley had been accustomed to doing his thinking with a pencil. As reporter, as novelist plotting his work, as amateur chemist in his home laboratory, as scientific warfare research officer, his ideas had always been clarified by making notes. He pushed a chair to the table and built up the seat with cushions, wondering how soon he would become used to the proportional disparity between himself and the furniture. As he opened the books and took his pencil in his hand, there was one thing missing. If he could only smoke a pipe, now!</p>
			<p>His father came out and stretched in a wicker chair with the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Times</i> book-review section. The morning hours passed. Allan Hartley leafed through one book and then the other. His pencil moved rapidly at times; at others, he doodled absently. There was no question, any more, in his mind, as to what or who he was. He was Allan Hartley, a man of forty-three, marooned in his own thirteen-year-old body, thirty years back in his own past. That was, of course, against all common sense, but he was easily able to ignore that objection. It had been made before: against the astronomy of Copernicus, and the geography of Columbus, and the biology of Darwin, and the industrial technology of Samuel Colt, and the military doctrines of Charles de Gaulle. Today’s common sense had a habit of turning into tomorrow’s utter nonsense. What he needed, right now, but bad, was a theory that would explain what had happened to him.</p>
			<p>Understanding was beginning to dawn when <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Stauber came out to announce midday dinner.</p>
			<p>“I hope you von’t mind haffin’ it so early,” she apologized. “Mein sister, Jennie, offer in Nippenose, she iss sick; I vant to go see her, dis afternoon, yet. I’ll be back in blenty time to get supper, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartley.”</p>
			<p>“Hey, Dad!” Allan spoke up. “Why can’t we get our own supper, and have a picnic, like? That’d be fun, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Stauber could stay as long as she wanted to.”</p>
			<p>His father looked at him. Such consideration for others was a most gratifying deviation from the juvenile norm; dawn of altruism, or something. He gave hearty assent:</p>
			<p>“Why, of course, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Stauber. Allan and I can shift for ourselves, this evening; can’t we, Allan? You needn’t come back till tomorrow morning.”</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="de">Ach</i>, t’ank you! T’ank you so mooch, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartley.”</p>
			<p>At dinner, Allan got out from under the burden of conversation by questioning his father about the War and luring him into a lengthy dissertation on the difficulties of the forthcoming invasion of Japan. In view of what he remembered of the next twenty-four hours, Allan was secretly amused. His father was sure that the War would run on to mid-1946.</p>
			<p>After dinner, they returned to the porch, Hartley père smoking a cigar and carrying out several law books. He only glanced at these occasionally; for the most part, he sat and blew smoke rings, and watched them float away. Some thrice-guilty felon was about to be triumphantly acquitted by a weeping jury; Allan could recognize a courtroom masterpiece in the process of incubation.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>It was several hours later that the crunch of feet on the walk caused father and son to look up simultaneously. The approaching visitor was a tall man in a rumpled black suit; he had knobby wrists and big, awkward hands; black hair flecked with gray, and a harsh, bigoted face. Allan remembered him. Frank Gutchall. Lived on Campbell Street; a religious fanatic, and some sort of lay preacher. Maybe he needed legal advice; Allan could vaguely remember some incident⁠—</p>
			<p>“Ah, good afternoon, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gutchall. Lovely day, isn’t it?” Blake Hartley said.</p>
			<p>Gutchall cleared his throat. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartley, I wonder if you could lend me a gun and some bullets,” he began, embarrassedly. “My little dog’s been hurt, and it’s suffering something terrible. I want a gun, to put the poor thing out of its pain.”</p>
			<p>“Why, yes; of course. How would a 20-gauge shotgun do?” Blake Hartley asked. “You wouldn’t want anything heavy.”</p>
			<p>Gutchall fidgeted. “Why, er, I was hoping you’d let me have a little gun.” He held his hands about six inches apart. “A pistol, that I could put in my pocket. It wouldn’t look right, to carry a hunting gun on the Lord’s day; people wouldn’t understand that it was for a work of mercy.”</p>
			<p>The lawyer nodded. In view of Gutchall’s religious beliefs, the objection made sense.</p>
			<p>“Well, I have a Colt .38-special,” he said, “but you know, I belong to this Auxiliary Police outfit. If I were called out for duty, this evening, I’d need it. How soon could you bring it back?”</p>
			<p>Something clicked in Allan Hartley’s mind. He remembered, now, what that incident had been. He knew, too, what he had to do.</p>
			<p>“Dad, aren’t there some cartridges left for the Luger?” he asked.</p>
			<p>Blake Hartley snapped his fingers. “By George, yes! I have a German automatic I can let you have, but I wish you’d bring it back as soon as possible. I’ll get it for you.”</p>
			<p>Before he could rise, Allan was on his feet.</p>
			<p>“Sit still, Dad; I’ll get it. I know where the cartridges are.” With that, he darted into the house and upstairs.</p>
			<p>The Luger hung on the wall over his father’s bed. Getting it down, he dismounted it, working with rapid precision. He used the blade of his pocketknife to unlock the endpiece of the breechblock, slipping out the firing pin and buttoning it into his shirt pocket. Then he reassembled the harmless pistol, and filled the clip with 9-millimeter cartridges from the bureau drawer.</p>
			<p>There was an extension telephone beside the bed. Finding Gutchall’s address in the directory, he lifted the telephone, and stretched his handkerchief over the mouthpiece. Then he dialed Police Headquarters.</p>
			<p>“This is Blake Hartley,” he lied, deepening his voice and copying his father’s tone. “Frank Gutchall, who lives at⁠ ⁠… take this down”⁠—he gave Gutchall’s address⁠—“has just borrowed a pistol from me, ostensibly to shoot a dog. He has no dog. He intends shooting his wife. Don’t argue about how I know; there isn’t time. Just take it for granted that I do. I disabled the pistol⁠—took out the firing pin⁠—but if he finds out what I did, he may get some other weapon. He’s on his way home, but he’s on foot. If you hurry, you may get a man there before he arrives, and grab him before he finds out the pistol won’t shoot.”</p>
			<p>“OK, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartley. We’ll take care of it. Thanks.”</p>
			<p>“And I wish you’d get my pistol back, as soon as you can. It’s something I brought home from the other War, and I shouldn’t like to lose it.”</p>
			<p>“We’ll take care of that, too. Thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartley.”</p>
			<p>He hung up, and carried the Luger and the loaded clip down to the porch.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“Look, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Gutchall; here’s how it works,” he said, showing it to the visitor. Then he slapped in the clip and yanked up on the toggle loading the chamber. “It’s ready to shoot, now; this is the safety.” He pushed it on. “When you’re ready to shoot, just shove it forward and up, and then pull the trigger. You have to pull the trigger each time; it’s loaded for eight shots. And be sure to put the safety back when you’re through shooting.”</p>
			<p>“Did you load the chamber?” Blake Hartley demanded.</p>
			<p>“Sure. It’s on safe, now.”</p>
			<p>“Let me see.” His father took the pistol, being careful to keep his finger out of the trigger guard, and looked at it. “Yes, that’s all right.” He repeated the instructions Allan had given, stressing the importance of putting the safety on after using. “Understand how it works, now?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“Yes, I understand how it works. Thank you, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hartley. Thank you, too, young man.”</p>
			<p>Gutchall put the Luger in his hip pocket, made sure it wouldn’t fall out, and took his departure.</p>
			<p>“You shouldn’t have loaded it,” Hartley père reproved, when he was gone.</p>
			<p>Allan sighed. This was it; the masquerade was over.</p>
			<p>“I had to, to keep you from fooling with it,” he said. “I didn’t want you finding out that I’d taken out the firing pin.”</p>
			<p>“You what?”</p>
			<p>“Gutchall didn’t want that gun to shoot a dog. He has no dog. He meant to shoot his wife with it. He’s a religious maniac; sees visions, hears voices, receives revelations, talks with the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost probably put him up to this caper. I’ll submit that any man who holds long conversations with the Deity isn’t to be trusted with a gun, and neither is any man who lies about why he wants one. And while I was at it, I called the police, on the upstairs phone. I had to use your name; I deepened my voice and talked through a handkerchief.”</p>
			<p>“You⁠—” Blake Hartley jumped as though bee-stung. “Why did you have to do that?”</p>
			<p>“You know why. I couldn’t have told them, ‘This is little Allan Hartley, just thirteen years old; please, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Policeman, go and arrest Frank Gutchall before he goes root-toot-toot at his wife with my pappa’s Luger.’ That would have gone over big, now, wouldn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“And suppose he really wants to shoot a dog; what sort of a mess will I be in?”</p>
			<p>“No mess at all. If I’m wrong⁠—which I’m not⁠—I’ll take the thump for it, myself. It’ll pass for a dumb kid trick, and nothing’ll be done. But if I’m right, you’ll have to front for me. They’ll keep your name out of it, but they’d give me a lot of cheap boy-hero publicity, which I don’t want.” He picked up his pencil again. “We should have the complete returns in about twenty minutes.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>That was a ten-minute underestimate, and it was another quarter-hour before the detective-sergeant who returned the Luger had finished congratulating Blake Hartley and giving him the thanks of the Department. After he had gone, the lawyer picked up the Luger, withdrew the clip, and ejected the round in the chamber.</p>
			<p>“Well,” he told his son, “you were right. You saved that woman’s life.” He looked at the automatic, and then handed it across the table. “Now, let’s see you put that firing pin back.”</p>
			<p>Allan Hartley dismantled the weapon, inserted the missing part, and put it together again, then snapped it experimentally and returned it to his father. Blake Hartley looked at it again, and laid it on the table.</p>
			<p>“Now, son, suppose we have a little talk,” he said softly.</p>
			<p>“But I explained everything.” Allan objected innocently.</p>
			<p>“You did not,” his father retorted. “Yesterday you’d never have thought of a trick like this; why, you wouldn’t even have known how to take this pistol apart. And at dinner, I caught you using language and expressing ideas that were entirely outside anything you’d ever known before. Now, I want to know⁠—and I mean this literally.”</p>
			<p>Allan chuckled. “I hope you’re not toying with the rather medieval notion of possession,” he said.</p>
			<p>Blake Hartley started. Something very like that must have been flitting through his mind. He opened his mouth to say something, then closed it abruptly.</p>
			<p>“The trouble is, I’m not sure you aren’t right,” his son continued. “You say you find me⁠—changed. When did you first notice a difference?”</p>
			<p>“Last night, you were still my little boy. This morning⁠—” Blake Hartley was talking more to himself than to Allan. “I don’t know. You were unusually silent at breakfast. And come to think of it, there was something⁠ ⁠… something strange⁠ ⁠… about you when I saw you in the hall, upstairs.⁠ ⁠… Allan!” he burst out, vehemently. “What has happened to you?”</p>
			<p>Allan Hartley felt a twinge of pain. What his father was going through was almost what he, himself, had endured, in the first few minutes after waking.</p>
			<p>“I wish I could be sure, myself, Dad,” he said. “You see, when I woke, this morning, I hadn’t the least recollection of anything I’d done yesterday. <time datetime="1945-08-04">August 4, 1945</time>, that is,” he specified. “I was positively convinced that I was a man of forty-three, and my last memory was of lying on a stretcher, injured by a bomb explosion. And I was equally convinced that this had happened in 1975.”</p>
			<p>“Huh?” His father straightened. “Did you say nineteen <em>seventy</em>-five?” He thought for a moment. “That’s right; in 1975, you will be forty-three. A bomb, you say?”</p>
			<p>Allan nodded. “During the siege of Buffalo, in the Third World War,” he said, “I was a captain in G5⁠—Scientific Warfare, General Staff. There’d been a transpolar air invasion of Canada, and I’d been sent to the front to check on service failures of a new lubricating oil for combat equipment. A week after I got there, Ottawa fell, and the retreat started. We made a stand at Buffalo, and that was where I copped it. I remember being picked up, and getting a narcotic injection. The next thing I knew, I was in bed, upstairs, and it was 1945 again, and I was back in my own little thirteen-year-old body.”</p>
			<p>“Oh, Allan, you just had a nightmare to end nightmares!” his father assured him, laughing a trifle too heartily. “That’s all!”</p>
			<p>“That was one of the first things I thought of. I had to reject it; it just wouldn’t fit the facts. Look; a normal dream is part of the dreamer’s own physical brain, isn’t it? Well, here is a part about two thousand percent greater than the whole from which it was taken. Which is absurd.”</p>
			<p>“You mean all this Battle of Buffalo stuff? That’s easy. All the radio commentators have been harping on the horrors of World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, and you couldn’t have avoided hearing some of it. You just have an undigested chunk of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H. V.</abbr> Kaltenborn raising hell in your subconscious.”</p>
			<p>“It wasn’t just World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>; it was everything. My four years at high school, and my four years at Penn State, and my seven years as a reporter on the Philadelphia Record. And my novels: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Children of the Mist</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rose of Death</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Conqueror’s Road</i>. They were no kid stuff. Why, yesterday I’d never even have thought of some of the ideas I used in my detective stories, that I published under a nom-de-plume. And my hobby, chemistry; I was pretty good at that. Patented a couple of processes that made me as much money as my writing. You think a thirteen-year-old just dreamed all that up? Or, here; you speak French, don’t you?” He switched languages and spoke at some length in good conversational slang-spiced Parisian. “Too bad you don’t speak Spanish, too,” he added, reverting to English. “Except for a Mexican accent you could cut with a machete, I’m even better there than in French. And I know some German, and a little Russian.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Blake Hartley was staring at his son, stunned. It was some time before he could make himself speak.</p>
			<p>“I could barely keep up with you, in French,” he admitted. “I can swear that in the last thirteen years of your life, you had absolutely no chance to learn it. All right; you lived till 1975, you say. Then, all of a sudden, you found yourself back here, thirteen years old, in 1945. I suppose you remember everything in between?” he asked. “Did you ever read James Branch Cabell? Remember Florian de Puysange, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The High Place</i>?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. You find the same idea in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Jurgen</i> too,” Allan said. “You know, I’m beginning to wonder if Cabell mightn’t have known something he didn’t want to write.”</p>
			<p>“But it’s impossible!” Blake Hartley hit the table with his hand, so hard that the heavy pistol bounced. The loose round he had ejected from the chamber toppled over and started to roll, falling off the edge. He stooped and picked it up. “How can you go back, against time? And the time you claim you came from doesn’t exist, now; it hasn’t happened yet.” He reached for the pistol magazine, to insert the cartridge, and as he did, he saw the books in front of his son. “Dunne’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Experiment with Time</i>,” he commented. “And <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">J. N. M.</abbr> Tyrrell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Science and Psychical Phenomena</i>. Are you trying to work out a theory?”</p>
			<p>“Yes.” It encouraged Allan to see that his father had unconsciously adopted an adult-to-adult manner. “I think I’m getting somewhere, too. You’ve read these books? Well, look, Dad; what’s your attitude on precognition? The ability of the human mind to exhibit real knowledge, apart from logical inference, of future events? You think Dunne is telling the truth about his experiences? Or that the cases in Tyrrell’s book are properly verified, and can’t be explained away on the basis of chance?”</p>
			<p>Blake Hartley frowned. “I don’t know,” he confessed. “The evidence is the sort that any court in the world would accept, if it concerned ordinary, normal events. Especially the cases investigated by the Society for Psychical Research: they <em>have</em> been verified. But how can anybody know of something that hasn’t happened yet? If it hasn’t happened yet, it doesn’t exist, and you can’t have real knowledge of something that has no real existence.”</p>
			<p>“Tyrrell discusses that dilemma, and doesn’t dispose of it. I think I can. If somebody has real knowledge of the future, then the future must be available to the present mind. And if any moment other than the bare present exists, then all time must be totally present; every moment must be perpetually coexistent with every other moment,” Allan said.</p>
			<p>“Yes. I think I see what you mean. That was Dunne’s idea, wasn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“No. Dunne postulated an infinite series of time dimensions, the entire extent of each being the bare present moment of the next. What I’m postulating is the perpetual coexistence of every moment of time in this dimension, just as every graduation on a yardstick exists equally with every other graduation, but each at a different point in space.”</p>
			<p>“Well, as far as duration and sequence go, that’s all right,” the father agreed. “But how about the ‘Passage of Time’?”</p>
			<p>“Well, time <em>does</em> appear to pass. So does the landscape you see from a moving car window. I’ll suggest that both are illusions of the same kind. We imagine time to be dynamic, because we’ve never viewed it from a fixed point, but if it is totally present, then it must be static, and in that case, we’re moving through time.”</p>
			<p>“That seems all right. But what’s your car window?”</p>
			<p>“If all time is totally present, then you must exist simultaneously at every moment along your individual life span,” Allan said. “Your physical body, and your mind, and all the thoughts contained in your mind, each at its appropriate moment in sequence. But what is it that exists only at the bare moment we think of as <em>now</em>?”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Blake Hartley grinned. Already, he was accepting his small son as an intellectual equal.</p>
			<p>“Please, teacher; what?”</p>
			<p>“Your consciousness. And don’t say, ‘What’s that?’ Teacher doesn’t know. But we’re only conscious of one moment; the illusory now. This is ‘now,’ and it was ‘now’ when you asked that question, and it’ll be ‘now’ when I stop talking, but each is a different moment. We imagine that all those nows are rushing past us. Really, they’re standing still, and our consciousness is whizzing past them.”</p>
			<p>His father thought that over for some time. Then he sat up. “Hey!” he cried, suddenly. “If some part of our ego is time-free and passes from moment to moment, it must be extraphysical, because the physical body exists at every moment through which the consciousness passes. And if it’s extraphysical, there’s no reason whatever for assuming that it passes out of existence when it reaches the moment of the death of the body. Why, there’s logical evidence for survival, independent of any alleged spirit communication! You can toss out Patience Worth, and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Osborne Leonard’s Feda, and Sir Oliver Lodge’s son, and Wilfred Brandon, and all the other spirit-communicators, and you still have evidence.”</p>
			<p>“I hadn’t thought of that,” Allan confessed. “I think you’re right. Well, let’s put that at the bottom of the agenda and get on with this time business. You ‘lose consciousness’ as in sleep; where does your consciousness go? I think it simply detaches from the moment at which you go to sleep, and moves backward or forward along the line of moment-sequence, to some prior or subsequent moment, attaching there.”</p>
			<p>“Well, why don’t we know anything about that?” Blake Hartley asked. “It never seems to happen. We go to sleep tonight, and it’s always tomorrow morning when we wake; never day-before-yesterday, or last month, or next year.”</p>
			<p>“It never⁠ ⁠… or almost never⁠ ⁠… <em>seems</em> to happen; you’re right there. Know why? Because if the consciousness goes forward, it attaches at a moment when the physical brain contains memories of the previous, consciously unexperienced, moment. You wake, remembering the evening before, because that’s the memory contained in your mind at that moment, and back of it are memories of all the events in the interim. See?”</p>
			<p>“Yes. But how about backward movement, like this experience of yours?”</p>
			<p>“This experience of mine may not be unique, but I never heard of another case like it. What usually happens is that the memories carried back by the consciousness are buried in the subconscious mind. You know how thick the wall between the subconscious and the conscious mind is. These dreams of Dunne’s, and the cases in Tyrrell’s book, are leakage. That’s why precognitions are usually incomplete and distorted, and generally trivial. The wonder isn’t that good cases are so few; it’s surprising that there are any at all.” Allan looked at the papers in front of him. “I haven’t begun to theorize about how I managed to remember everything. It may have been the radiations from the bomb, or the effect of the narcotic, or both together, or something at this end, or a combination of all three. But the fact remains that my subconscious barrier didn’t function, and everything got through. So, you see, I am obsessed⁠—by my own future identity.”</p>
			<p>“And I’d been afraid that you’d been, well, taken-over by some⁠ ⁠… some outsider.” Blake Hartley grinned weakly. “I don’t mind admitting, Allan, that what’s happened has been a shock. But that other⁠ ⁠… I just couldn’t have taken that.”</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>“No. Not and stayed sane. But really, I am your son; the same entity I was yesterday. I’ve just had what you might call an educational shortcut.”</p>
			<p>“I’ll say you have!” His father laughed in real amusement. He discovered that his cigar had gone out, and re-lit it. “Here; if you can remember the next thirty years, suppose you tell me when the War’s going to end. This one, I mean.”</p>
			<p>“The Japanese surrender will be announced at exactly 1901⁠—7:01 <abbr>p.m.</abbr> present style⁠—on August 14. A week from Tuesday. Better make sure we have plenty of grub in the house by then. Everything will be closed up tight till Thursday morning; even the restaurants. I remember, we had nothing to eat in the house but some scraps.”</p>
			<p>“Well! It is handy, having a prophet in the family! I’ll see to it <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Stauber gets plenty of groceries in.⁠ ⁠… Tuesday a week? That’s pretty sudden, isn’t it?”</p>
			<p>“The Japs are going to think so,” Allan replied. He went on to describe what was going to happen.</p>
			<p>His father swore softly. “You know, I’ve heard talk about atomic energy, but I thought it was just Buck Rogers stuff. Was that the sort of bomb that got you?”</p>
			<p>“That was a firecracker to the bomb that got me. That thing exploded a good ten miles away.”</p>
			<p>Blake Hartley whistled softly. “And that’s going to happen in thirty years! You know, son, if I were you, I wouldn’t like to have to know about a thing like that.” He looked at Allan for a moment. “Please, if you know, don’t ever tell me when I’m going to die.”</p>
			<p>Allan smiled. “I can’t. I had a letter from you just before I left for the front. You were seventy-eight, then, and you were still hunting, and fishing, and flying your own plane. But I’m not going to get killed in any Battle of Buffalo, this time, and if I can prevent it, and I think I can, there won’t be any World War <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>.”</p>
			<p>“But⁠—You say all time exists, perpetually coexistent and totally present,” his father said. “Then it’s right there in front of you, and you’re getting closer to it, every watch tick.”</p>
			<p>Allan Hartley shook his head. “You know what I remembered, when Frank Gutchall came to borrow a gun?” he asked. “Well, the other time, I hadn’t been home: I’d been swimming at the Canoe Club, with Larry Morton. When I got home, about half an hour from now, I found the house full of cops. Gutchall talked the .38 officers’ model out of you, and gone home; he’d shot his wife four times through the body, finished her off with another one back of the ear, and then used his sixth shot to blast his brains out. The cops traced the gun; they took a very poor view of your lending it to him. You never got it back.”</p>
			<p>“Trust that gang to keep a good gun,” the lawyer said.</p>
			<p>“I didn’t want us to lose it, this time, and I didn’t want to see you lose face around City Hall. Gutchalls, of course, are expendable,” Allan said. “But my main reason for fixing Frank Gutchall up with a padded cell was that I wanted to know whether or not the future could be altered. I have it on experimental authority that it can be. There must be additional dimensions of time; lines of alternate probabilities. Something like William Seabrook’s witch-doctor friend’s Fan-Shaped Destiny. When I brought memories of the future back to the present, I added certain factors to the causal chain. That set up an entirely new line of probabilities. On no notice at all, I stopped a murder and a suicide. With thirty years to work, I can stop a world war. I’ll have the means to do it, too.”</p>
			<p>“The means?”</p>
			<p>“Unlimited wealth and influence. Here.” Allan picked up a sheet and handed it to his father. “Used properly, we can make two or three million on that, alone. A list of all the Kentucky Derby, Preakness, and Belmont winners to 1970. That’ll furnish us primary capital. Then, remember, I was something of a chemist. I took it up, originally, to get background material for one of my detective stories; it fascinated me, and I made it a hobby, and then a source of income. I’m thirty years ahead of any chemist in the world, now. You remember <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.G.</abbr> Farbenindustrie? Ten years from now, we’ll make them look like pikers.”</p>
			<p>His father looked at the yellow sheet. “Assault, at eight to one,” he said. “I can scrape up about five thousand for that⁠—Yes; in ten years⁠—Any other little operations you have in mind?” he asked.</p>
			<p>“About 1950, we start building a political organization, here in Pennsylvania. In 1960, I think we can elect you President. The world situation will be crucial, by that time, and we had a good-natured nonentity in the White House then, who let things go till war became inevitable. I think President Hartley can be trusted to take a strong line of policy. In the meantime, you can read Machiavelli.”</p>
			<p>“That’s my little boy, talking!”</p>
			<p>Blake Hartley said softly. “All right, son; I’ll do just what you tell me, and when you grow up, I’ll be president.⁠ ⁠… Let’s go get supper, now.”</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">I</h3>
				<p>Kiro Soran, the guard captain, stood in the shadow of the veranda roof, his white cloak thrown back to display the scarlet lining. He rubbed his palm reflectively on the checkered butt of his revolver and watched the four men at the table.</p>
				<p>“And ten tens are a hundred,” one of the clerks in blue jackets said, adding another stack to the pile of gold coins.</p>
				<p>“Nineteen hundreds,” one of the pair in dirty striped robes agreed, taking a stone from the box in front of him and throwing it away. Only one stone remained. “One more hundred to pay.”</p>
				<p>One of the blue-jacketed plantation clerks made a tally mark; his companion counted out coins, ten and ten and ten.</p>
				<p>Dosu Golan, the plantation manager, tapped impatiently on his polished boot leg with a thin riding whip.</p>
				<p>“I don’t like this,” he said, in another and entirely different language. “I know, chattel slavery’s an established custom on this sector, and we have to conform to local usages, but it sickens me to have to haggle with these swine over the price of human beings. On the Zarkantha Sector, we used nothing but free wage-labor.”</p>
				<p>“Migratory workers,” the guard captain said. “Humanitarian considerations aside, I can think of a lot better ways of meeting the labor problem on a fruit plantation than by buying slaves you need for three months a year and have to feed and quarter and clothe and doctor the whole twelve.”</p>
				<p>“Twenty hundreds of <i xml:lang="und">obus</i>,” the clerk who had been counting the money said. “That is the payment, is it not, Coru-hin-Irigod?”</p>
				<p>“That is the payment,” the slave dealer replied.</p>
				<p>The clerk swept up the remaining coins, and his companion took them over and put them in an iron-bound chest, snapping the padlock. The two guards who had been loitering at one side slung their rifles and picked up the chest, carrying it into the plantation house. The slave dealer and his companion arose, putting their money into a leather bag; Coru-hin-Irigod turned and bowed to the two men in white cloaks.</p>
				<p>“The slaves are yours, noble lords,” he said.</p>
				<p>Across the plantation yard, six more men in striped robes, with carbines slung across their backs, approached; with them came another man in a hooded white cloak, and two guards in blue jackets and red caps, with bayoneted rifles. The man in white and his armed attendants came toward the house; the six Calera slavers continued across the yard to where their horses were picketed.</p>
				<p>“If I do not offend the noble lords, then,” Coru-hin-Irigod said, “I beg their sufferance to depart. I and my men have far to ride if we would reach Careba by nightfall. The Lord, the Great Lord, the Lord God Safar watch between us until we meet again.”</p>
				<p>Urado Alatana, the labor foreman, came up onto the porch as the two slavers went down.</p>
				<p>“Have a good look at them, Radd?” the guard captain asked.</p>
				<p>“You think I’m crazy enough to let those bandits out of here with two thousand <i xml:lang="und">obus</i>⁠—forty thousand Paratemporal Exchange Units⁠—of the Company’s money without knowing what we’re getting?” the other parried. “They’re all right⁠—nice, clean, healthy-looking lot. I did everything but take them apart and inspect the pieces while they were being unshackled at the stockade. I’d like to know where this Coru-hin-Whatshisname got them, though. They’re not local stuff. Lot darker, and they’re jabbering among themselves in some lingo I never heard before. A few are wearing some rags of clothing, and they have odd-looking sandals. I noticed that most of them showed marks of recent whipping. That may mean they’re troublesome, or it may just mean that these Caleras are a lot of sadistic brutes.”</p>
				<p>“Poor devils!” The man called Dosu Golan was evidently hoping that he’d never catch himself talking about fellow humans like that. The guard captain turned to him.</p>
				<p>“Coming to have a look at them, Doth?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“You go, Kirv; I’ll see them later.”</p>
				<p>“Still not able to look the Company’s property in the face?” the captain asked gently. “You’ll not get used to it any sooner than now.”</p>
				<p>“I suppose you’re right.” For a moment Dosu Golan watched Coru-hin-Irigod and his followers canter out of the yard and break into a gallop on the road beyond. Then he tucked his whip under his arm. “All right, then. Let’s go see them.”</p>
				<p>The labor foreman went into the house; the manager and the guard captain went down the steps and set out across the yard. A big slat-sided wagon, drawn by four horses, driven by an old slave in a blue smock and a thing like a sunbonnet, rumbled past, loaded with newly-picked oranges. Blue woodsmoke was beginning to rise from the stoves at the open kitchen and a couple of slaves were noisily chopping wood. Then they came to the stockade of close-set pointed poles. A guard sergeant in a red-trimmed blue jacket, armed with a revolver, met them with a salute which Kiro Soran returned: he unfastened the gate and motioned four or five riflemen into positions from which they could fire in between the poles in case the slaves turned on their new owners.</p>
				<p>There seemed little danger of that, though Kiro Soran kept his hand close to the butt of his revolver. The slaves, an even hundred of them, squatted under awnings out of the sun, or stood in line to drink at the water-butt. They furtively watched the two men who had entered among them, as though expecting blows or kicks; when none were forthcoming, they relaxed slightly. As the labor foreman had said, they were clean and looked healthy. They were all nearly naked; there were about as many women as men, but no children or old people.</p>
				<p>“Radd’s right,” the captain told the new manager. “They’re not local. Much darker skins, and different face-structure; faces wedge-shaped instead of oval, and differently shaped noses, and brown eyes instead of black. I’ve seen people like that, somewhere, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>He fell silent. A suspicion, utterly fantastic, had begun to form in his mind, and he stepped closer to a group of a dozen-odd, the manager following him. One or two had been unmercifully lashed, not long ago, and all bore a few lash-marks. Odd sort of marks, more like burn-blisters than welts. He’d have to have the Company doctor look at them. Then he caught their speech, and the suspicion was converted to certainty.</p>
				<p>“These are not like the others: they wear fine garments, and walk proudly. They look stern, but not cruel. They are the real masters here; the others are but servants.”</p>
				<p>He grasped the manager’s arm and drew him aside.</p>
				<p>“You know that language?” he asked. When the man called Dosu Golan shook his head, he continued: “That’s Kharanda; it’s a dialect spoken by a people in the Ganges Valley, in India, on the Kholghoor Sector of the Fourth Level.”</p>
				<p>Dosu Golan blinked, and his face went blank for a moment.</p>
				<p>“You mean they’re from outtime?” he demanded. “Are you sure?”</p>
				<p>“I did two years on Fourth Level Kholghoor with the Paratime Police, before I took this job,” the man called Kiro Soran replied. “And another thing. Those lash-marks were made with some kind of an electric whip. Not these rawhide quirts the Caleras use.”</p>
				<p>It took the plantation manager all of five seconds to add that up. The answer frightened him.</p>
				<p>“Kirv, this is going to make a simply hideous uproar, all the way up to Home Timeline main office,” he said. “I don’t know what I’m going to do⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Well, I know what I have to do.” The captain raised his voice, using the local language: “Sergeant! Run to the guardhouse, and tell Sergeant Adarada to mount up twenty of his men and take off after those Caleras who sold us these slaves. They’re headed down the road toward the river. Tell him to bring them all back, and especially their chief, Coru-hin-Irigod, and him I want alive and able to answer questions. And then get the white-cloak lord Urado Alatena, and come back here.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, captain.” The guards were all Yarana people; they disliked Caleras intensely. The sergeant threw a salute, turned, and ran.</p>
				<p>“Next, we’ll have to isolate these slaves,” Kiro Soran said. “You’d better make a full report to the Company as soon as possible. I’m going to transpose to Police Terminal Timeline and make my report to the Sector-Regional Subchief. Then⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Now wait a moment, Kirv,” Dosu Golan protested. “After all, I’m the manager, even if I am new here. It’s up to me to make the decisions⁠—”</p>
				<p>Kiro Soran shook his head. “Sorry, Doth. Not this one,” he said. “You know the terms under which I was hired by the Company. I’m still a field agent of the Paratime Police, and I’m reporting back on duty as soon as I can transpose to Police Terminal. Look; here are a hundred men and women who have been shifted from one timeline, on one paratemporal sector of probability, to another. Why, the world from which these people came doesn’t even exist in this space-time continuum. There’s only one way they could have gotten here, and that’s the way we did⁠—in a Ghaldron-Hesthor paratemporal transposition field. You can carry it on from there as far as you like, but the only thing it adds up to is a case for the Paratime Police. You had better include in your report mention that I’ve reverted to police status; my Company pay ought to be stopped as of now. And until somebody who outranks me is sent here, I’m in complete charge. Paratime Transposition Code, Section <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVII</span>, Article 238.”</p>
				<p>The plantation manager nodded. Kiro Soran knew how he must feel; he laid a hand gently on the younger man’s shoulder.</p>
				<p>“You understand how it is, Doth; this is the only thing I can do.”</p>
				<p>“I understand, Kirv. Count on me for absolutely anything.” He looked at the brown-skinned slaves, and lines of horror and loathing appeared around his mouth. “To think that some of our own people would do a thing like this! I hope you can catch the devils! Are you transposing out, now?”</p>
				<p>“In a few minutes. While I’m gone, have the doctor look at those whip-injuries. Those things could get infected. Fortunately, he’s one of our own people.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, of course. And I’ll have these slaves isolated, and if Adarada brings back Coru-hin-Irigod and his gang before you get back, I’ll have them locked up and waiting for you. I suppose you want to narco-hypnotize and question the whole lot, slaves and slavers?”</p>
				<p>The labor foreman, known locally as Urado Alatena, entered the stockade.</p>
				<p>“What’s wrong, Kirv?” he asked.</p>
				<p>The Paratime Police agent told him, briefly. The labor foreman whistled, threw a quick glance at the nearest slaves, and nodded.</p>
				<p>“I knew there was something funny about them,” he said. “Doth, what a simply beastly thing to happen, two days after you take charge here!”</p>
				<p>“Not his fault,” the Paratime Police agent said. “I’m the one the Company’ll be sore at, but I’d rather have them down on me rather than old Tortha Karf. Well, sit on the lid till I get back,” he told both of them. “We’ll need some kind of a story for the locals. Let’s see⁠—Explain to the guards, in the hearing of some of the more talkative slaves, that these slaves are from the Asian mainland, that they are of a people friendly to our people, and that they were kidnaped by pirates, our enemies. That ought to explain everything satisfactorily.”</p>
				<p>On his way back to the plantation house, he saw a clump of local slaves staring curiously at the stockade, and noticed that the guards had unslung their rifles and fixed their bayonets. None of them had any idea, of course, of what had happened, but they all seemed to know, by some sort of <abbr epub:type="z3998:acronym">ESP</abbr>, that something was seriously wrong. It was going to get worse, too, when strangers began arriving, apparently from nowhere, at the plantation.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Verkan Vall waited until the small, dark-eyed woman across the circular table had helped herself from one of the bowls on the revolving disk in the middle, then rotated it to bring the platter of cold boar-ham around to himself.</p>
				<p>“Want some of this, Dalla?” he asked, transferring a slice of ham and a spoonful of wine sauce to his plate.</p>
				<p>“No, I’ll have some of the venison,” the black-haired girl beside him said. “And some of the pickled beans. We’ll be getting our fill of pork, for the next month.”</p>
				<p>“I thought the Dwarma Sector people were vegetarians,” Jandar Jard, the theatrical designer, said. “Most nonviolent peoples are, aren’t they?”</p>
				<p>“Well, the Dwarma people haven’t any specific taboo against taking life,” Bronnath Zara, the dark-eyed woman in the brightly colored gown, told him. “They’re just utterly noncombative, nonaggressive. When I was on the Dwarma Sector, there was a horrible scandal at the village where I was staying. It seems that a farmer and a meat butcher fought over the price of a pig. They actually raised their voices and shouted contradictions at each other. That happened two years before, and people were still talking about it.”</p>
				<p>“I didn’t think they had any money, either,” Verkan Vall’s wife, Hadron Dalla, said.</p>
				<p>“They don’t,” Zara said. “It’s all barter and trade. What are you and Vall going to use for a visible means of support, while you’re there?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I have my mandolin, and I’ve learned all the traditional Dwarma songs by hypno-mech,” Dalla said. “And Transtime Tours is fitting Vall out with a bag of tools; he’s going to do repair work and carpentry.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, good; you’ll be welcome anywhere,” Zara, the sculptress, said. “They’re always glad to entertain a singer, and for people who do the fine decorative work they do, they’re the most incompetent practical mechanics I’ve ever seen or heard of. You’re going to travel from village to village?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. The cover-story is that we’re lovers who have left our village in order not to make Vall’s former wife unhappy by our presence,” Dalla said.</p>
				<p>“Oh, good! That’s entirely in the Dwarma romantic tradition,” Bronnath Zara approved. “Ordinarily, you know, they don’t like to travel. They have a saying: ‘Happy are the trees, they abide in their own place; sad are the winds, forever they wander.’ But that’ll be a fine explanation.”</p>
				<p>Thalvan Dras, the big man with the black beard and the long red coat and cloth-of-gold sash who lounged in the host’s seat, laughed.</p>
				<p>“I can just see Vall mending pots, and Dalla playing that mandolin and singing,” he said. “At least, you’ll be getting away from police work. I don’t suppose they have anything like police on the Dwarma Sector?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no; they don’t even have any such concept,” Bronnath Zara said. “When somebody does something wrong, his neighbors all come and talk to him about it till he gets ashamed, then they all forgive him and have a feast. They’re lovely people, so kind and gentle. But you’ll get awfully tired of them in about a month. They have absolutely no respect for anybody’s privacy. In fact, it seems slightly indecent to them for anybody to want privacy.”</p>
				<p>One of Thalvan Dras’ human servants came into the room, coughed apologetically, and said:</p>
				<p>“A visiphone-call for His Valor, the Mavrad of Nerros.”</p>
				<p>Vall went on nibbling ham and wine sauce; the servant repeated the announcement a trifle more loudly.</p>
				<p>“Vall, you’re being paged!” Thalvan Dras told him, with a touch of impatience.</p>
				<p>Verkan Vall looked blank for an instant, then grinned. It had been so long since he had even bothered to think about that antiquated title of nobility⁠—</p>
				<p>“Vall’s probably forgotten that he has a title,” a girl across the table, wearing an almost transparent gown and nothing else, laughed.</p>
				<p>“That’s something the Mavrad of Mnirna and Thalvabar never forgets,” Jandar Jard drawled, with what, in a woman, would have been cattishness.</p>
				<p>Thalvan Dras gave him a hastily repressed look of venomous anger, then said something, more to Verkan Vall than to Jandar Jard, about titles of nobility being the marks of social position and responsibility which their bearers should never forget. That jab, Vall thought, following the servant out of the room, had been a mistake on Jard’s part. A music-drama, for which he had designed the settings, was due to open here in Dhergabar in another ten days. Thalvan Dras would cherish spite, and a word from the Mavrad of Mnirna and Thalvabar would set a dozen critics to disparaging Jandar’s work. On the other hand, maybe it had been smart of Jandar Jard to antagonize Thalvan Dras; for every critic who bowed slavishly to the wealthy nobleman, there were at least two more who detested him unutterably, and they would rush to Jandar Jard’s defense, and in the ensuing uproar, the settings would get more publicity than the drama itself.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>In the visiphone booth, Vall found a girl in a green blouse, with the Paratime Police insigne on her shoulder, looking out of the screen. The wall behind her was pale green striped in gold and black.</p>
				<p>“Hello, Eldra,” he greeted her.</p>
				<p>“Hello, Chief’s Assistant: I’m sorry to bother you, but the Chief wants to talk to you. Just a moment, please.”</p>
				<p>The screen exploded into a kaleidoscopic flash of lights and colors, then cleared again. This time, a man looked out of it. He was well into middle age; close to his three hundredth year. His hair, a uniform iron-gray, was beginning to thin in front, and he was acquiring the beginnings of a double chin. His name was Tortha Karf, and he was Chief of Paratime Police, and Verkan Vall’s superior.</p>
				<p>“Hello, Vall. Glad I was able to locate you. When are you and Dalla leaving?”</p>
				<p>“As soon as we can get away from this luncheon, here. Oh, say an hour. We’re taking a rocket to Zarabar, and transposing from there to Passenger Terminal Sixteen, and from there to the Dwarma Sector.”</p>
				<p>“Well, Vall, I hate to bother you like this,” Tortha Karf said, “but I wish you’d stop by Headquarters on your way to the rocketport. Something’s come up⁠—it may be a very nasty business⁠—and I’d like to talk to you about it.”</p>
				<p>“Well, Chief, let me remind you that this vacation, which I’ve had to postpone four times already, has been overdue for four years,” Vall said.</p>
				<p>“Yes, Vall, I know. You’ve been working very hard, and you and Dalla are entitled to a little time together. I just want you to look into something, before you leave.”</p>
				<p>“It’ll have to take some fast looking. Our rocket blasts off in two hours.”</p>
				<p>“It may take a little longer; if it does, you and Dalla can transpose to Police Terminal and take a rocket for Zarabar Equivalent, and transpose from there to Passenger Sixteen. It would save time if you brought Dalla with you to Headquarters.”</p>
				<p>“Dalla won’t like this,” Vall understated.</p>
				<p>“No. I’m afraid not.” Tortha Karf looked around apprehensively, as though estimating the damage an enraged Hadron Dalla could do to his office furnishings. “Well, try to get here as soon as you can.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Thalvan Dras was holding forth, when Vall returned, on one of his favorite preoccupations.</p>
				<p>“… Reason I’m taking such an especially active interest in this year’s Arts Exhibitions; I’ve become disturbed at the extent to which so many of our artists have been content to derive their motifs, even their techniques, from outtime art.” He was using his vocowriter, rather than his conversational, voice. “I yield to no one in my appreciation of outtime art⁠—you all know how devotedly I collect objects of art from all over paratime⁠—but our own artists should endeavor to express their artistic values in our own artistic idioms.”</p>
				<p>Vall bent over his wife’s shoulder.</p>
				<p>“We have to leave, right away,” he whispered.</p>
				<p>“But our rocket doesn’t blast off for two hours⁠—”</p>
				<p>Thalvan Dras had stopped talking and was looking at them in annoyance.</p>
				<p>“I have to go to Headquarters before we leave. It’ll save time if you come along.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, no, Vall!” She looked at him in consternation. “Was that Tortha Karf, calling?” She replaced her plate on the table and got to her feet.</p>
				<p>“I’m dreadfully sorry, Dras,” he addressed their host. “I just had a call from Tortha Karf. A few minor details that must be cleared up, before I leave Home Timeline. If you’ll accept our thanks for a wonderful luncheon⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Why, certainly, Vall. Brogoth, will you call⁠—” He gave a slight chuckle. “I’m so used to having Brogoth Zaln at my elbow that I’d forgotten he wasn’t here. Wait. I’ll call one of the servants to have a car for you.”</p>
				<p>“Don’t bother; we’ll take an aircab,” Vall told him.</p>
				<p>“But you simply can’t take a public cab!” The black-bearded nobleman was shocked at such an obscene idea. “I will have a car ready for you in a few minutes.”</p>
				<p>“Sorry, Dras; we have to hurry. We’ll get a cab on the roof. Goodbye, everybody; sorry to have to break away like this. See you all when we get back.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Hadron Dalla watched dejectedly as the green crags and escarpments of the Paratime Building loomed above the city in front of them, and began slipping under the aircab. She felt like a prisoner recaptured at the moment when attempted escape was about to succeed.</p>
				<p>“I knew it,” she said. “I knew he’d find something. He’s trying to break things up between us, the way he did twenty years ago.”</p>
				<p>Vall crushed out his cigarette and said nothing. That hadn’t been true, and she knew it as well as he did. There had been many other factors involved in the disintegration of their previous marriage, most of them of her own contribution. But that had been twenty years ago, she told herself. This time it would be different, if only⁠—</p>
				<p>“Really, Vall, he’s never liked me,” she went on. “He’s jealous of me, I think. You’re to be his successor, when he retires, and he thinks I’m not a good influence⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Oh, rubbish, Dalla! The Chief has always liked you,” Vall replied. “If he didn’t, do you think he’d always be inviting us to that farm of his, on Fifth Level Sicily? It’s just that this job of ours has no end; something’s always turning up, outtime.”</p>
				<p>The music that the cab had been playing died away. “Paratime Building, just below,” it said, in a light feminine voice. “Which landing stage, please?” Vall leaned forward and punched at the buttons in front of him. Something in the cab’s electronic brain gave a rapid series of clicks as it shifted from the general Paratime Building beam to the beam of the Paratime Police landing stage, then it said, “Thank you.” The building below seemed to rotate upward toward them as it settled down. Then the antigrav-field snapped off, the cab door popped open, and the cab said: “Goodbye, now. Ride with me again, sometime.”</p>
				<p>They crossed the landing stage, entered the antigrav shaft, and floated downward; at the end of a hallway, below, Vall opened the door of Tortha Karf’s office and ushered her through ahead of him.</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf, inside the semicircle of his desk, was speaking into a recording phone as they approached. He shut off the machine and waved, a cigarette in his hand.</p>
				<p>“Come on back and sit down,” he invited. “Be with you in a moment.” Then he switched on the phone again and went on talking⁠—something about prompter evaluation and transmission of reports and less reliance on robot equipment. “Sign that up, my personal order, and see it’s transmitted to everybody down to and including Sector Regional Subchief level,” he finished, then hung up the phone and turned to them.</p>
				<p>“Sorry about this,” he said. “Sit down, if you please. Cigarettes?”</p>
				<p>She shook her head and sat down in one of the chairs behind the desk; she started to relax and then caught herself and sat erect, her hands on her lap.</p>
				<p>“This won’t interfere with your vacation, Vall,” Tortha Karf was saying. “I just need a little help before you transpose out.”</p>
				<p>“We have to catch the rocket for Zarabar in an hour and a half,” Dalla reminded him.</p>
				<p>“Don’t worry about that; if you miss the commercial rocket, our police rockets can give it an hour’s start and pass it before it gets to Zarabar,” Tortha Karf said. Then he turned to Vall. “Here’s what’s happened,” he said. “One of our field agents on detached duty as guard captain for Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs on a fruit plantation in western North America, Third Level Esaron Sector, was looking over a lot of slaves who had been sold to the plantation by a local slave dealer. He heard them talking among themselves⁠—in Kharanda.”</p>
				<p>Dalla caught the significance of that before Vall did. At first, she was puzzled; then, in spite of herself, she was horrified and angry. Tortha Karf was explaining to Vall just where and on what paratemporal sector Kharanda was spoken.</p>
				<p>“No possibility that this agent, Skordran Kirv, could have been mistaken. He worked for a while on Kholghoor Sector, himself; knew the language by hypno-mech and by two years’ use,” Tortha Karf was saying. “So he ordered himself back on duty, had the slaves isolated and the slave dealers arrested, and then transposed to Police Terminal to report. The SecReg Subchief, old Vulthor Tharn, confirmed him in charge at this Esaron Sector plantation, and assigned him a couple of detectives and a psychist.”</p>
				<p>“When was this?” Vall asked.</p>
				<p>“Yesterday. One-Five-Nine Day. About 1500 local time.”</p>
				<p>“Twenty-three hundred Dhergabar time,” Vall commented.</p>
				<p>“Yes. And I just found out about it. Came in in the late morning generalized report-digest; very inconspicuous item, no special urgency symbol or anything. Fortunately, one of the report editors spotted it and messaged Police Terminal for a copy of the original report.”</p>
				<p>“It’s been a long time since we had anything like that,” Vall said, studying the glowing tip of his cigarette, his face wearing the curiously withdrawn expression of a conscious memory recall. “Fifty years ago; the time that gang kidnaped some girls from Second Level Triplanetary Empire Sector and sold them into the harem of some Fourth Level Indo-Turanian sultan.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. That was your first independent case, Vall. That was when I began to think you’d really make a cop. One renegade First Level citizen and four or five ServSec Prole hoodlums, with a stolen fifty-foot conveyer. This looks like a rather more ambitious operation.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Dalla got one of her own cigarettes out and lit it. Vall and Tortha Karf were talking cop talk about method of operation and possible size of the gang involved, and why the slaves had been shipped all the way from India to the west coast of North America.</p>
				<p>“Always ready sale for slaves on the Esaron Sector,” Vall was saying. “And so many small independent states, and different languages, that outtimers wouldn’t be particularly conspicuous.”</p>
				<p>“And with this barbarian invasion going on on the Kholghoor Sector, slaves could be picked up cheaply,” Tortha Karf added.</p>
				<p>In spite of her determination to boycott the conversation, curiosity began to get the better of her. She had spent a year and a half on the Kholghoor Sector, investigating alleged psychic powers of the local priests. There’d been nothing to it⁠—the prophecies weren’t precognition, they were shrewd inferences, and the miracles weren’t psychokinesis, they were sleight-of-hand. She found herself asking:</p>
				<p>“What barbarian invasion’s this?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Central Asian nomadic people, the Croutha,” Tortha Karf told her. “They came down through Khyber Pass about three months ago, turned east, and hit the headwaters of the Ganges. Without punching a lot of buttons to find out exactly, I’d say they’re halfway to the delta country by now. Leader seems to be a chieftain called Llamh Droogh the Red. A lot of paratime trading companies are yelling for permits to introduce firearms in the Kholghoor Sector to protect their holdings there.”</p>
				<p>She nodded. The Fourth Level Kholghoor Sector belonged to what was known as Indus-Ganges-Irriwady Basic Sector-Grouping⁠—probability of civilization having developed late on the Indian subcontinent, with the rest of the world, including Europe, in Stone Age savagery or early Bronze Age barbarism. The Kharandas, the people among whom she had once done field-research work, had developed a pre-mechanical, animal-power, handcraft, edge-weapon culture. She could imagine the roads jammed with fugitives from the barbarian invaders, the conveyer hidden among the trees, the lurking slavers⁠—</p>
				<p>Watch it, Dalla! Don’t let the old scoundrel play on your feelings!</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“Well, what do you want me to do, Chief?” Vall was asking.</p>
				<p>“Well, I have to know just what this situation’s likely to develop into, and I want to know why Vulthor Tharn’s been sitting on this ever since Skordran Kirv reported it to him⁠—”</p>
				<p>“I can answer the second one now,” Vall replied. “Vulthor Tharn is due to retire in a few years. He has a negatively good, undistinguished record. He’s trying to play it safe.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf nodded. “That’s what I thought. Look, Vall; suppose you and Dalla transpose from here to Police Terminal, and go to Novilan Equivalent, and give this a quick look-over and report to me, and then rocket to Zarabar Equivalent and go on with your trip to the Dwarma Sector. It may delay you eight or ten hours, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Closer twenty-four,” Vall said. “I’d have to transpose to this plantation, on the Esaron Sector. How about it, Dalla? Would you want to do that?”</p>
				<p>She hesitated for a moment, angry with him. He didn’t want to refuse, and he was trying to make her do it for him.</p>
				<p>“I know, it’s a confounded imposition, Dalla,” Tortha Karf told her. “But it’s important that I get a prompt and full estimate of the situation. This may be something very serious. If it’s an isolated incident, it can be handled in a routine manner, but I’m afraid it’s not. It has all the marks of a large-scale operation, and if this is a matter of mass kidnapings from one sector and transpositions to another, you can see what a threat this is to the Paratime Secret.”</p>
				<p>“Moral considerations entirely aside,” Vall said. “We don’t need to discuss them; they’re too obvious.”</p>
				<p>She nodded. For over twelve millennia, the people of her race and Vall’s and Tortha Karf’s had been existing as parasites on all the innumerable other worlds of alternate probability on the lateral dimension of time. Smart parasites never injure their hosts, and try never to reveal their existence.</p>
				<p>“We could do that, couldn’t we, Vall?” she asked, angry at herself now for giving in. “And if you want to question these slaves, I speak Kharanda, and I know how they think. And I’m a qualified and licensed narco-hypnotic technician.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s splendid, Dalla!” Tortha Karf enthused. “Wait a moment; I’ll message Police Terminal to have a rocket ready for you.”</p>
				<p>“I’ll need a hypno-mech for Kharanda, myself,” Vall said. “Dalla, do you know Acalan?” When she shook her head, he turned back to Tortha Karf. “Look; it’s about a four-hour rocket hop to Novilan Equivalent. Say we have the hypno-mech machines installed in the rocket; Dalla and I can take our language lessons on the way, and be ready to go to work as soon as we land.”</p>
				<p>“Good idea,” Tortha Karf approved. “I’ll order that done, right away. Now⁠—”</p>
				<p>Oddly enough, she wasn’t feeling so angry, now that she had committed herself and Vall. Come to think of it, she had never been on Police Terminal Timeline; very few people, outside the Paratime Police, ever had. And, she had always wanted to learn more about Vall’s work, and participate in it with him. And if she’d made him refuse, it would have been something ugly between them all the time they would be on the Dwarma Sector. But this way⁠—</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The big circular conveyer room was crowded, as it had been every minute of every day for the past ten thousand years. At the great circular desk in the center, departing or returning police officers were checking in or out with the flat-topped cylindrical robot clerks, or talking to human attendants. Some were in the regulation green uniform; others, like himself, were in civilian clothes; more were in outtime costumes from all over paratime. Fringed robes and cloth-of-gold sashes and conical caps from the Second Level Khiftan Sector; Fourth Level Proto-Aryan mail and helmets; the short tunics and kilts of Fourth Level Alexandrian-Roman Sector; the Zarkantha loincloth and felt cap and daggers; there were priestly vestments stiff with gold, and military uniforms; there were trousers and jackboots and bare legs; blasters, and swords, and pistols, and bows and quivers, and spears. And the place was loud with a babel of voices and the clatter of teleprinters.</p>
				<p>Dalla was looking about her in surprised delight; for her, the vacation had already begun. He was glad; for a while, he had been afraid that she would be unhappy about it. He guided her through the crowd to the desk, spoke for a while to one of the human attendants, and found out which was their conveyer. It was a fixed-destination shuttler, operative only between Home Timeline and Police Terminal, from which most of the Paratime Police operations were routed. He put Dall in through the sliding door, followed, and closed it behind him, locking it. Then, before he closed the starting switch, he drew a pistollike weapon and checked it.</p>
				<p>In theory, the Ghaldron-Hesthor paratemporal transposition field was uninfluenced by material objects outside it. In practice, however, such objects occasionally intruded, and sometimes they were alive and hostile. The last time he had been in this conveyer room, he had seen a quartet of returning officers emerge from a conveyer dome dragging a dead lion by the tail. The sigma-ray needler, which he carried, was the only weapon which could be used, under the circumstances. It had no effect whatever on any material structure and could be used inside an activated conveyer without deranging the conductor-mesh, as, say, a bullet or the vibration of an ultrasonic paralyzer would do, and it was instantly fatal to anything having a central nervous system. It was a good weapon to use outtime for that reason, also; even on the most civilized timeline, the most elaborate autopsy would reveal no specific cause of death.</p>
				<p>“What’s the Esaron Sector like?” Dalla asked, as the conveyer dome around them coruscated with shifting light and vanished.</p>
				<p>“Third Level; probability of abortive attempt to colonize this planet from Mars about a hundred thousand years ago,” he said. “A few survivors⁠—a shipload or so⁠—were left to shift for themselves while the parent civilization on Mars died out. They lost all vestiges of their original Martian culture, even memory of their extraterrestrial origin. About fifteen hundred to two thousand years ago, a reasonably high electrochemical civilization developed and they began working with nuclear energy and developed reaction-drive spaceships. But they’d concentrated so on the inorganic sciences, and so far neglected the bio-sciences, that when they launched their first ship for Venus they hadn’t yet developed a germ theory of disease.”</p>
				<p>“What happened when they ran into the green-vomit fever?” Dalla asked.</p>
				<p>“About what you could expect. The first⁠—and only⁠—ship to return brought it back to Terra. Of course, nobody knew what it was, and before the epidemic ended, it had almost depopulated this planet. Since the survivors knew nothing about germs, they blamed it on the anger of the gods⁠—the old story of recourse to supernaturalism in the absence of a known explanation⁠—and a fanatically anti-scientific cult got control. Of course, space travel was taboo; so was nuclear and even electric power. For some reason, steam power and gunpowder weren’t offensive to the gods. They went back to a low-order steam-power, black-powder, culture, and haven’t gotten beyond that to this day. The relatively civilized regions are on the east coast of Asia and the west coast of North America; civilized race more or less Caucasian. Political organization just barely above the tribal level⁠—thousands of petty kingdoms and republics and principalities and feudal holdings and robbers’ roosts. The principal industries are brigandage, piracy, slave-raiding, cattle-rustling and intercommunal warfare. They have a few ramshackle steam railways, and some steamboats on the rivers. We sell them coal and manufactured goods, mostly in exchange for foodstuffs and tobacco. Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs has the sector franchise. That’s one of the companies Thalvan Dras gets his money from.”</p>
				<p>They had run down through the civilized Second and Third Levels and were leaving the Fourth behind and entering the Fifth, existing in the probability of a world without human population. Once in a while, around them, they caught brief flashes of buildings and rocketports and spaceports and landing stages, as the conveyer took them through narrow paratime belts on which their own civilization had established outposts⁠—Fifth Level Commercial, Fifth Level Passenger, Industrial Sector, Service Sector.</p>
				<p>Finally the conveyer dome around them shimmered into visibility and materialized; when they emerged, there were policemen in green uniforms who entered to search the dome with drawn needlers to make sure they had picked up nothing dangerous on the way. The room outside was similar to the one they had left on Home Timeline, even to the shifting, noisy crowd in incongruously-mixed costumes.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The rocketport was a ten minutes’ trip by aircar from the conveyer head; when they boarded the stubby-winged strato-rocket, Vall saw that two of the passenger-seats had square metal cabinets bolted in place behind them and blue plastic helmets on swinging arms mounted above them.</p>
				<p>“Everything’s set up,” the pilot told them. “<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hadron, you sit on the left; that cabinet’s loaded with language tape for Acalan. Yours is loaded with a tape of Kharanda; that’s the Fourth Level Kholghoor language you wanted, Chief’s Assistant. Shall I help you get fixed in your seats?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, if you please. Here, Dalla, I’ll fix that for you.”</p>
				<p>Dalla was already asleep when the pilot was adjusting his helmet and giving him his injection. He never felt the rocket tilt into firing position, and while he slept, the Kharands language, with all its vocabulary and grammar, became part of his subconscious knowledge, needing only the mental pronunciation of a trigger-symbol to bring it into consciousness. The pilot was already unfastening and raising his helmet when he opened his eyes. Dalla, beside him, was sipping a cup of spiced wine.</p>
				<p>On the landing stage of the Sector-Regional Headquarters at Novilan Equivalent, four or five people were waiting for them. Vall recognized the subchief, Vulthor Tharn, who introduced another man, in riding boots and a white cloak, as Skordran Kirv. Vall clasped hands with him warmly.</p>
				<p>“Good work, Agent Skordran. You got onto this promptly.”</p>
				<p>“I tried to, sir. Do you want the dope now? We have half an hour’s flight to our spatial equivalent, and another half hour in transposition.”</p>
				<p>“Give it to me on the way,” he said, and turned to Vulthor Tharn. “Our Esaron costumes ready?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. Over there in the control tower. We have a temporary conveyer head set up about two hundred miles south of here, which will take you straight through to the plantation.”</p>
				<p>“Suppose you change now, Dalla,” he said. “Subchief, I’d like a word with you privately.”</p>
				<p>He and Vulthor Tharn excused themselves and walked over to the edge of the landing stage. The SecReg Subchief was outwardly composed, but Vall sensed that he was worried and embarrassed.</p>
				<p>“Now, what’s been done since you got Agent Skordran’s report?” Vall asked.</p>
				<p>“Well, sir, it seems that this is more serious than we had anticipated. Field Agent Skordran, who will give you the particulars, says that there is every indication that a large and well-organized gang of paratemporal criminals, our own people, are at work. He says that he’s found evidence of activities on Fourth Level Kholghoor that don’t agree with any information we have about conditions on that sector.”</p>
				<p>“Beside transmitting Agent Skordran’s report to Dhergabar through the robot report-system, what have you done about it?”</p>
				<p>“I confirmed Agent Skordran in charge of the local investigation, and gave him two detectives and a psychist, sir. As soon as we could furnish hypno-mech indoctrination in Kharanda to other psychists, I sent them along. He now has four of them, and eight detectives. By that time, we had a conveyer head right at this Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs plantation.”</p>
				<p>“Why didn’t you just borrow psychists from SecReg for Kholghoor, Eastern India?” Vall asked. “Subchief Ranthar would have loaned you a few.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, I couldn’t call on another SecReg for men without higher-echelon authorization. Especially not from another Sector Organization, even another Level Authority,” Vulthor Tharn said. “Beside, it would have taken longer to bring them here than hypno-mech our own personnel.”</p>
				<p>He was right about the second point. Vall agreed mentally; however, his real reason was procedural.</p>
				<p>“Did you alert Ranthar Jard to what was going on in his SecReg?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Gracious, no!” Vulthor Tharn was scandalized. “I have no authority to tell people of equal echelon in other Sector and Level organizations what to do. I put my report through regular channels; it wasn’t my place to go outside my own jurisdiction.”</p>
				<p>And his report had crawled through channels for fourteen hours, Vall thought.</p>
				<p>“Well, on my authority, and in the name of Chief Tortha, you message Ranthar Jard at once; send him every scrap of information you have on the subject, and forward additional information as it comes in to you. I doubt he’ll find anything on any timeline that’s being exploited by any legitimate paratimers. This gang probably work exclusively on unpenetrated timelines; this business Skordran Kirv came across was a bad blunder on some underling’s part.” He saw Dalla emerge from the control tower in breeches and boots and a white cloak, buckling on a heavy revolver. “I’ll go change, now; you get busy calling Ranthar Jard. I’ll see you when I get back.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“Are you taking over, Chief’s Assistant?” Skordran Kirv asked, as the aircar lifted from the landing stage.</p>
				<p>“Not at all. My wife and I are starting on our vacation, as soon as I find out what’s been happening here, and report to Chief Tortha. Did your native troopers catch those slavers?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, they got them yesterday afternoon; we’ve had them ever since. Do you want the whole thing just as it happened, Assistant Verkan, or just a condensation?”</p>
				<p>“Give me what you think it indicates, remembering that you’re probably trying to analyze a large situation from a very small sample.”</p>
				<p>“It’s big, all right,” Skordran Kirv said. “This gang can’t number less than a hundred men, maybe several hundred. They must have at least two two-hundred-foot conveyers and several small ones, and bases on what sounds like some Fifth Level Time line, and at least one air freighter of around five thousand tons. They are operating on a number of Kholghoor and Esaron timelines.”</p>
				<p>Verkan Vall nodded. “I didn’t think it was any petty larceny,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Wait till you hear the rest of it. On the Kholghoor Sector, this gang is known as the Wizard Traders; we’ve been using that as a convenience label. They pose as sorcerers⁠—black robes and hood-masks covered with luminous symbols, voice-amplifiers, cold-light auras, energy-weapons, mechanical magic tricks, that sort of thing. They have all the Croutha scared witless. Their procedure is to establish camps in the forest near recently conquered Kharanda cities; then they appear to the Croutha, impress them with their magical powers, and trade manufactured goods for Kharanda captives. They mainly trade firearms, apparently some kind of flintlocks, and powder.”</p>
				<p>Then they were confining their operations to unpenetrated timelines; there had been no reports of firearms in the hands of the Croutha invaders.</p>
				<p>“After they buy a batch of slaves,” Skordran Kirv continued, “they transpose them to this presumably Fifth Level base, where they have concentration camps. The slaves we questioned had been airlifted to North America, where there’s another concentration camp, and from there transposed to this Esaron Sector timeline where I found them. They say that there were at least two to three thousand slaves in this North American concentration camp and that they are being transposed out in small batches and replaced by others airlifted in from India. This lot was sold to a Calera named Nebu-hin-Abenoz, the chieftain of a hill town, Careba, about fifty miles southwest of the plantation. There were two hundred and fifty in this batch; this Coru-hin-Irigod only bought the batch he sold at the plantation.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The aircar lost speed and altitude; below, the countryside was dotted with conveyer heads, each spatially coexistent with some outtime police post or operation. There were a great many of them; the western coast of North America was a center of civilization on many paratemporal sectors, and while the conveyer heads of the commercial and passenger companies were scattered over hundreds of Fifth Level timelines, those of the Paratime Police were concentrated upon one. The anti-grav-car circled around a three-hundred-foot steel tower that supported a conveyer head spatially coexistent with one on a top floor of some outtime tall building, and let down in front of a low prefabricated steel shed. A man in police uniform came out to meet them. There was a fifty-foot conveyer dome inside, and a fifty-foot redlined circle that marked the transposition point of an outtime conveyer. They all entered the dome, and the operator put on the transposition field.</p>
				<p>“You haven’t heard the worst of it yet.” Skordran Kirv was saying. “On this timeline, we have reason to think that the native, Nebu-hin-Abenoz, who bought the slaves, actually saw the slavers’ conveyer. Maybe even saw it activated.”</p>
				<p>“If he did, we’ll either have to capture him and give him a memory-obliteration, or kill him,” Vall said. “What do you know about him?”</p>
				<p>“Well, this Careba, the town he bosses, is a little walled town up in the hills. Everybody there is related to everybody else; this man we have, Coru-hin-Irigod, is the son of a sister of Nebu-hin-Abenoz’s wife. They’re all bandits and slavers and cattle rustlers and what have you. For the last ten years, Nebu-hin-Abenoz has been buying slaves from some secret source. Before the Kholghoor Sector people began coming in, they were mostly white, with a few brown people who might have been Polynesians. No Negroes⁠—there’s no black race on this sector, and I suppose the paratime slavers didn’t want too many questions asked. Coru-hin-Irigod, under narco-hypnosis, said that they were all outlanders, speaking strange languages.”</p>
				<p>“Ten years! And this is the first hint we’ve had of it,” Vall said. “That’s not a bright mark for any of us. I’ll bet the slave population on some of these Esaron timelines is an anthropologist’s nightmare.”</p>
				<p>“Why, if this has been going on for ten years, there must have been millions upon millions of people dragged from their own timelines into slavery!” Dalla said in a shocked voice.</p>
				<p>“Ten years may not be all of it,” Vall said. “This Nebu-hin-Abenoz looks like the only tangible lead we have, at present. How does he operate?”</p>
				<p>“About once every ten days, he’ll take ten or fifteen men and go a day’s ride⁠—that may be as much as fifty miles; these Caleras have good horses and they’re hard riders⁠—into the hills. He’ll take a big bag of money, all gold. After dark, when he has made camp, a couple of strangers in Calera dress will come in. He’ll go off with them, and after about an hour, he’ll come back with eight or ten of these strangers and a couple of hundred slaves, always chained in batches of ten. Nebu-hin-Abenoz pays for them, makes arrangements for the next meeting, and the next morning he and his party start marching the slaves to Careba. I might add that, until now, these slaves have been sold to the mines east of Careba; these are the first that have gotten into the coastal country.”</p>
				<p>“That’s why this hasn’t come to light before, then. The conveyer comes in every ten days, at about the same place?”</p>
				<p>“Yes. I’ve been thinking of a way we might trap them,” Skordran Kirv said. “I’ll need more men, and equipment.”</p>
				<p>“Order them from Regional or General Reserve.” Vall told him. “This thing’s going to have overtop priority till it’s cleared up.”</p>
				<p>He was mentally cursing Vulthor Tharn’s procedure-bound timidity as the conveyer flickered and solidified around them and the overhead red light turned green.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>They emerged into the interior of a long shed, adobe-walled and thatch-roofed, with small barred windows set high above the earth floor. It was cool and shadowy, and the air was heavy with the fragrance of citrus fruits. There were bins along the walls, some partly full of oranges, and piles of wicker baskets. Another conveyer dome stood beside the one in which they had arrived; two men in white cloaks and riding boots sat on the edge of one of the bins, smoking and talking.</p>
				<p>Skordran Kirv introduced them⁠—Gathon Dard and Krador Arv, special detectives⁠—and asked if anything new had come up. Krador Arv shook his head.</p>
				<p>“We still have about forty to go,” he said. “Nothing new in their stories; still the same two timelines.”</p>
				<p>“These people,” Skordran Kirv explained, “were all peons on the estate of a Kharanda noble just above the big bend of the Ganges. The Croutha hit their master’s estate about a ten-days ago, elapsed time. In telling about their capture, most of them say that their master’s wife killed herself with a dagger after the Croutha killed her husband, but about one out of ten say that she was kidnaped by the Croutha. Two different timelines, of course. The ones who tell the suicide story saw no firearms among the Croutha; the ones who tell the kidnap story say that they all had some kind of muskets and pistols. We’re making synthetic summaries of the two stories.”</p>
				<p>“We’re having trouble with the locals about all these strangers coming in,” Gathon Dard added. “They’re getting curious.”</p>
				<p>“We’ll have to take a chance on that,” Vall said. “Are the interrogations still going on? Then let’s have a look-in at them.”</p>
				<p>The big double doors at the end of the shed were barred on the inside. Krador Arv unlocked a small side door, letting Vall, Dalla and Gathon Dard out. In the yard outside, a gang of slaves were unloading a big wagon of oranges and packing them into hampers; they were guarded by a couple of native riflemen who seemed mostly concerned with keeping them away from the shed, and a man in a white cloak was watching the guards for the same purpose. He walked over and introduced himself to Vall.</p>
				<p>“Golzan Doth, local alias Dosu Golan. I’m Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs’ manager here.”</p>
				<p>“Nasty business for you people,” Vall sympathized. “If it’s any consolation, it’s a bigger headache for us.”</p>
				<p>“Have you any idea what’s going to be done about these slaves?” Golzan Doth asked. “I have to remember that the Company has forty thousand Paratemporal Exchange Units invested in them. The top office was very specific in requesting information about that.”</p>
				<p>Vall shook his head. “That’s over my echelon,” he said. “Have to be decided by the Paratime Commission. I doubt if your company’ll suffer. You bought them innocently, in conformity with local custom. Ever buy slaves from this Coru-hin-Irigod before?”</p>
				<p>“I’m new, here. The man I’m replacing broke his neck when his horse put a foot in a gopher hole about two ten-days ago.”</p>
				<p>Beside him, Vall could see Dalla nod as though making a mental note. When she got back to Home Timeline, she’d put a crew of mediums to work trying to contact the discarnate former plantation manager; at Rhogom Institute, she had been working on the problem of return of a discarnate personality from outtime.</p>
				<p>“A few times,” Skordran Kirv said. “Nothing suspicious; all local stuff. We questioned Coru-hin-Irigod pretty closely on that point, and he says that this is the first time he ever brought a batch of Nebu-hin-Abenoz’s outlanders this far west.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The interrogations were being conducted inside the plantation house, in the secret central rooms where the paratimers lived. Skordran Kirv used a door-activator to slide open a hidden door.</p>
				<p>“I suppose I don’t have to warn either of you that any positive statement made in the hearing of a narco-hypnotized subject⁠—” he began.</p>
				<p>“… Has the effect of hypnotic suggestion⁠—” Vall picked up after him.</p>
				<p>“… And should be avoided unless such suggestion is intended,” Dalla finished.</p>
				<p>Skordran Kirv laughed, opening another, inner door, and stood aside. In what had been the paratimers’ recreation room, most of the furniture had been shoved into the corners. Four small tables had been set up, widely spaced and with screens between; across each of them, with an electric recorder between, an almost naked Kharanda slave faced a Paratime Police psychist. At a long table at the far side of the room, four men and two girls were working over stacks of cards and two big charts.</p>
				<p>“Phrakor Vuln,” the man who was working on the charts introduced himself. “Synthesist.” He introduced the others.</p>
				<p>Vall made a point of the fact that Dalla was his wife, in case any of the cops began to get ideas, and mentioned that she spoke Kharanda, had spent some time on the Fourth Level Kholghoor, and was a qualified psychist.</p>
				<p>“What have you got, so far?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Two different timelines, and two different gangs of Wizard Traders,” Phrakor Vuln said. “We’ve established the latter from physical descriptions and because both batches were sold by the Croutha at equivalent periods of elapsed time.”</p>
				<p>Vall picked up one of the kidnap-story cards and glanced at it.</p>
				<p>“I notice there’s a fair verbal description of these firearms, and mention of electric whips,” he said. “I’m curious about where they came from.”</p>
				<p>“Well, this is how we reconstructed them, Chief’s Assistant,” one of the girls said, handing him a couple of sheets of white drawing paper.</p>
				<p>The sketches had been done with soft pencil; they bore repeated erasures and corrections. That of the whip showed a cylindrical handle, indicated as twelve inches in length and one in diameter, fitted with a thumb-switch.</p>
				<p>“That’s definitely Second Level Khiftan,” Vall said, handing it back. “Made of braided copper or silver wire and powered with a little nuclear-conversion battery in the grip. They heat up to about two hundred centigrade; produce really painful burns.”</p>
				<p>“Why, that’s beastly!” Dalla exclaimed.</p>
				<p>“Anything on the Khiftan Sector is.” Skordran Kirv looked at the four slaves at the tables. “We don’t have a really bad case here, now. A few of these people were lash-burned horribly, though.”</p>
				<p>Vall was looking at the other sketches. One was a musket, with a wide butt and a band-fastened stock; the lock-mechanism, vaguely flintlock, had been dotted in tentatively. The other was a long pistol, similarly definite in outline and vague in mechanical detail; it was merely a knob-butted miniature of the musket.</p>
				<p>“I’ve seen firearms like these; have a lot of them in my collection,” he said, handing back the sketches. “Low-order mechanical or high-order pre-mechanical cultures. Fact is, things like those could have been made on the Kholghoor Sector, if the Kharandas had learned to combine sulfur, carbon and nitrates to make powder.”</p>
				<p>The interrogator at one of the tables had evidently heard all his subject could tell him. He rose, motioning the slave to stand.</p>
				<p>“Now, go with that man,” he said in Kharanda, motioning to one of the detectives in native guard uniform. “You will trust him; he is your friend and will not harm you. When you have left this room, you will forget everything that has happened here, except that you were kindly treated and that you were given wine to drink and your hurts were anointed. You will tell the others that we are their friends and that they have nothing to fear from us. And you will not try to remove the mark from the back of your left hand.”</p>
				<p>As the detective led the slave out a door at the other side of the room, the psychist came over to the long table, handing over a card and lighting a cigarette.</p>
				<p>“Suicide story,” he said to one of the girls, who took the card.</p>
				<p>“Anything new?”</p>
				<p>“Some minor details about the sale to the Caleras on this timeline. I think we’ve about scraped bottom.”</p>
				<p>“You can’t say that,” Phrakor Vuln objected. “The very last one may give us something nobody else had noticed.”</p>
				<p>Another subject was sent out. The interrogator came over to the table.</p>
				<p>“One of the kidnap-story crowd,” he said. “This one was right beside that Croutha who took the shot at the wild pig or whatever it was on the way to the Wizard Traders’ camp. Best description of the guns we’ve gotten so far. No question that they’re flintlocks.” He saw Verkan Vall. “Oh, hello, Assistant Verkan. What do you make of them? You’re an authority on outtime weapons, I understand.”</p>
				<p>“I’d have to see them. These people simply don’t think mechanically enough to give a good description. A lot of peoples make flintlock firearms.”</p>
				<p>He started running over, in his mind, the paratemporal areas in which gunpowder but not the percussion-cap was known. Expanding cultures, which had progressed as far as the former but not the latter. Static cultures, in which an accidental discovery of gunpowder had never been followed up by further research. Post-debacle cultures, in which a few stray bits of ancient knowledge had survived.</p>
				<p>Another interrogator came over, and then the fourth. For a while they sat and talked and drank coffee, and then the next quartet of slaves, two men and two women, were brought in. One of the women had been badly blistered by the electric whips of the Wizard Traders; in spite of reassurances, all were visibly apprehensive.</p>
				<p>“We will not harm you,” one of the psychists told them. “Here; here is medicine for your hurts. At first, it will sting, as good medicines will, but soon it will take away all pain. And here is wine for you to drink.”</p>
				<p>A couple of detectives approached, making a great show of pouring wine and applying ointment; under cover of the medication, they jabbed each slave with a hypodermic needle, and then guided them to seats at the four tables. Vall and Dalla went over and stood behind one of the psychists, who had a small flashlight in his hand.</p>
				<p>“Now, rest for a while,” the psychist was saying. “Rest and let the good medicine do its work. You are tired and sleepy. Look at this magic light, which brings comfort to the troubled. Look at the light. Look⁠ ⁠… at⁠ ⁠… the⁠ ⁠… light.”</p>
				<p>They moved to the next table.</p>
				<p>“Did you have a hand in the fighting?”</p>
				<p>“No, lord. We were peasant folk, not fighting people. We had no weapons, nor weapon-skill. Those who fought were all killed; we held up empty hands, and were spared to be captives of the Croutha.”</p>
				<p>“What happened to your master, the Lord Ghromdour, and to his lady?”</p>
				<p>“One of the Croutha threw a hatchet and killed our master, and then his lady drew a dagger and killed herself.”</p>
				<p>The psychist made a red mark on the card in front of him, and circled the number on the back of the slave’s hand with red indelible crayon. Vall and Dalla went to the third table.</p>
				<p>“They had the common weapons of the Croutha, lord, and they also had the weapons of the Wizard Traders. Of these, they carried the long weapons slung across their backs, and the short weapons thrust through their belts.”</p>
				<p>A blue mark on the card; a blue circle on the back of the slave’s hand.</p>
				<p>They listened to both versions of what had happened at the sack of the Lord Ghromdour’s estate, and the march into the captured city of Jhirda, and the second march into the forest to the camp of the Wizard Traders.</p>
				<p>“The servants of the Wizard Traders did not appear until after the Croutha had gone away; they wore different garb. They wore short jackets, and trousers, and short boots, and they carried small weapons on their belts⁠—”</p>
				<p>“They had whips of great cruelty that burned like fire; we were all lashed with these whips, as you may see, lord⁠—”</p>
				<p>“The Croutha had bound us two and two, with neck-yokes; these the servants of the Wizard Traders took off from us, and they chained us together by tens, with the chains we still wore when we came to this place⁠—”</p>
				<p>“They killed my child, my little Zhouzha!” the woman with the horribly blistered back was wailing. “They tore her out of my arms, and one of the servants of the Wizard Traders⁠—may Khokhaat devour his soul forever!⁠—dashed out her brains. And when I struggled to save her. I was thrown on the ground, and beaten with the fire-whips until I fainted. Then I was dragged into the forest, along with the others who were chained with me.” She buried her head in her arms, sobbing bitterly.</p>
				<p>Dalla stepped forward, taking the flashlight from the interrogator with one hand and lifting the woman’s head with the other. She flashed the light quickly in the woman’s eyes.</p>
				<p>“You will grieve no more for your child,” she said. “Already, you are forgetting what happened at the Wizard Traders’ camp, and remembering only that your child is safe from harm. Soon you will remember her only as a dream of the child you hope to have, some day.” She flashed the light again, then handed it back to the psychist. “Now, tell us what happened when you were taken into the forest; what did you see there?”</p>
				<p>The psychist nodded approvingly, made a note on the card, and listened while the woman spoke. She had stopped sobbing, now, and her voice was clear and cheerful.</p>
				<p>Vall went over to the long table.</p>
				<p>“Those slaves were still chained with the Wizard Traders’ chains when they were delivered here. Where are the chains?” he asked Skordran Kirv.</p>
				<p>“In the permanent conveyer room,” Skordran Kirv said. “You can look at them there; we didn’t want to bring them in here, for fear these poor devils would think we were going to chain them again. They’re very light, very strong; some kind of alloy steel. Files and power saws only polish them; it takes fifteen seconds to cut a link with an atomic torch. One long chain, and short lengths, fifteen inches long, staggered, every three feet, with a single hinge-shackle for the ankle. The shackles were riveted with soft wrought-iron rivets, evidently made with some sort of a power riveting-machine. We cut them easily with a cold chisel.”</p>
				<p>“They ought to be sent to Dhergabar Equivalent, Police Terminal, for study of material and workmanship. Now, you mentioned some scheme you had for capturing this conveyer that brings in the slaves for Nebu-hin-Abenoz. What have you in mind?”</p>
				<p>“We still have Coru-hin-Irigod and all his gang, under hypno. I’d thought of giving them hypnotic conditioning, and sending them back to Careba with orders to put out some kind of signal the next time Nebu-hin-Abenoz starts out on a buying trip. We could have a couple of men posted in the hills overlooking Careba, and they could send a message-ball through to Police Terminal. Then, a party could be sent with a mobile conveyer to ambush Nebu-hin-Abenoz on the way, and wipe out his party. Our people could take their horses and clothing and go on to take the conveyer by surprise.”</p>
				<p>“I’d suggest one change. Instead of relying on visual signals by the hypno-conditioned Coru-hin-Irigod, send a couple of our men to Careba with midget radios.”</p>
				<p>Skordran Kirv nodded. “Sure. We can condition Coru-hin-Irigod to accept them as friends and vouch for them at Careba. Our boys can be traders and slave buyers. Careba’s a market town; traders are always welcome. They can have firearms to sell⁠—revolvers and repeating rifles. Any Calera’ll buy any firearm that’s better than the one he’s carrying; they’ll always buy revolvers and repeaters. We can get what we want from Commercial Four-Oh-Seven; we can get riding and pack horses here.”</p>
				<p>Vall nodded. “And the post overlooking or in radio range of Careba on this timeline, and another on PolTerm. For the ambush of Nebu-hin-Abenoz’s gang and the capture of the conveyer, use anything you want to⁠—sleep-gas, paralyzers, energy-weapons, antigrav-equipment, anything. As far as regulations about using only equipment appropriate to local culture-levels, forget them entirely. But take that conveyer intact. You can locate the base timeline from the settings of the instrument panel, and that’s what we want most of all.”</p>
				<p>Dalla and the police psychist, having finished with and dismissed their subject, came over to the long table.</p>
				<p>“… That poor creature,” Dalla was saying. “What sort of fiends are they?”</p>
				<p>“If that made you sick, remember we’ve been listening to things like that for the last eight hours. Some of the stories were even worse than that one.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I’d like to use a heat-gun on the whole lot of them, turned down to where it’d just fry them medium-rare,” Dalla said. “And for whoever’s back of this, take him to Second Level Khiftan and sell him to the priests of Fasif.”</p>
				<p>“Too bad you’re not coming back from your vacation, instead of starting out. Chief’s Assistant Verkan,” Skordran Kirv said. “This is too big for me to handle alone, and I’d sooner work under you than anybody else Chief Tortha sends in.”</p>
				<p>“Vall!” Dalla cried in indignation. “You’re not going to just report on this and then walk away from it, are you?”</p>
				<p>“But, darling,” Vall replied, in what he hoped was a convincing show of surprise. “You don’t want our vacation postponed again, do you? If I get mixed up in this, there’s no telling when I can get away, and by the time I’m free, something may come up at Rhogom Institute that you won’t want to drop⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Vall, you know perfectly well that I wouldn’t be happy for an instant on the Dwarma Sector, thinking about this⁠—”</p>
				<p>“All right, then; let’s forget about the vacation. You want to stay on for a while and help me with this? It’ll be a lot of hard work, but we’ll be together.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, of course. I want to do something to smash those devils. Vall, if you’d heard some of the things they did to those poor people⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Well, I’ll have to go back to PolTerm, as soon as I’m reasonably well filled in on this, and report to Tortha Karf and tell him I’ve taken charge. You can stay here and help with these interrogations; I’ll be back in about ten hours. Then, we can go to Kholghoor East India SecReg <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">H.Q.</abbr> to talk to Ranthar Jard. We may be able to get something that’ll help us on that end⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You may be able to have your vacation before too long, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hadron,” Skordran Kirv told her. “Once we capture one of their conveyers, the instrument panel’ll tell us what timeline they’re working from, and then we’ll have them.”</p>
				<p>“There’s an Indo-Turanian Sector parable about a snake charmer who thought he was picking up his snake and found that he had hold of an elephant’s tail,” Vall said. “That might be a good thing to bear in mind, till we find out just what we have picked up.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Coming down a hallway on the hundred and seventh floor of the Management wing of the Paratime Building, Yandar Yadd paused to admire, in the green mirror of the glassoid wall, the jaunty angle of his silver-feathered cap, the fit of his short jacket, and the way his weapon hung at his side. This last was not instantly recognizable as a weapon; it looked more like a portable radio, which indeed it was. It was, none the less, a potent weapon. One flick of his finger could connect that radio with one at Tri-Planet News Service, and within the hour anything he said into it would be heard by all Terra, Mars and Venus. In consequence, there existed around the Paratime Building a marked and understandable reluctance to antagonize Yandar Yadd.</p>
				<p>He glanced at his watch. It was twenty minutes short of 1000, when he had an appointment with Baltan Vrath, the comptroller general. Glancing about, he saw that he was directly in front of the doorway of the Outtime Claims Bureau, and he strolled in, walking through the waiting room and into the claims-presentation office. At once, he stiffened like a bird dog at point.</p>
				<p>Sphabron Larv, one of his young legmen, was in altercation across the counter-desk with Varkar Klav, the Deputy Claims Agent on duty at the time. Varkar was trying to be icily dignified; Sphabron Larv’s black hair was in disarray and his face was suffused with anger. He was pounding with his fist on the plastic counter-top.</p>
				<p>“You have to!” he was yelling in the older man’s face. “That’s a public document, and I have a right to see it. You want me to go into Tribunes’ Court and get an order? If I do, there’ll be a Question in Council about why I had to, before the day’s out!”</p>
				<p>“What’s the matter, Larv?” Yandar Yadd asked lazily. “He trying to hold something out on you?”</p>
				<p>Sphabron Larv turned; his eyes lit happily when he saw his boss, and then his anger returned.</p>
				<p>“I want to see a copy of an indemnity claim that was filed this morning,” he said. “Varkar, here, won’t show it to me. What does he think this is, a Fourth Level dictatorship?”</p>
				<p>“What kind of a claim, now?” Yandar Yadd addressed Larv, ignoring Varkar Klav.</p>
				<p>“Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs⁠—one of the Thalvan Interests companies⁠—just claimed forty thousand <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.E.U.</abbr> for a hundred slaves bought by one of their plantation managers on Third Level Esaron from a local slave dealer. The Paratime Police impounded the slaves for narco-hypnotic interrogation, and then transposed the lot of them to Police Terminal.”</p>
				<p>Yandar Yadd still held his affectation of sleepy indolence.</p>
				<p>“Now why would the Paracops do that, I wonder? Slavery’s an established local practice on Esaron Sector; our people have to buy slaves if they want to run a plantation.”</p>
				<p>“I know that.” Sphabron Larv replied. “That’s what I want to find out. There must be something wrong, either with the slaves, or the treatment our people were giving them, or the Paratime Police, and I want to find out which.”</p>
				<p>“To tell the truth, Larv, so do I.” Yandar Yadd said. He turned to the man behind the counter. “Varkar, do we see that claim, or do I make a story out of your refusal to show it?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“The Paratime Police asked me to keep this confidential,” Varkar Klav said. “Publicity would seriously hamper an important police investigation.”</p>
				<p>Yandar Yadd made an impolite noise. “How do I know that all it would do would be to reveal police incompetence?” he retorted. “Look, Varkar; you and the Paratime Police and the Paratime Commission and the Home Timeline Management are all hired employees of the Home Timeline public. The public has a right to know what its employees are doing, and it’s my business to see that they’re informed. Now, for the last time⁠—will you show us a copy of that claim?”</p>
				<p>“Well, let me explain, off the record⁠—” the official begged.</p>
				<p>“Huh-uh! Huh-uh! I had that off-the-record gag worked on me when I was about Larv’s age, fifty years ago. Anything I get, I put on the air or not at my own discretion.”</p>
				<p>“All right,” Varkar Klav surrendered, pointing to a reading screen and twiddling a knob. “But when you read it, I hope you have enough discretion to keep quiet about it.”</p>
				<p>The screen lit, and Yandar Yadd automatically pressed a button for a photocopy. The two newsmen stared for a moment, and then even Yandar Yadd’s shell of drowsy negligence cracked and fell from him. His hand brushed the switch as he snatched the handphone from his belt.</p>
				<p>“Marva!” he barked, before the girl at the news office could more than acknowledge. “Get this recorded for immediate telecast.⁠ ⁠… Ready? Beginning: The existence of a huge paratemporal slave trade came to light on the afternoon of One-Five-Nine Day, on a timeline of the Third Level Esaron Sector, when Field Agent Skordran Kirv, Paratime Police, discovered, at an orange plantation of Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Salgath Trod sat alone in his private office, his half-finished lunch growing cold on the desk in front of him as he watched the teleview screen across the room, tuned to a pickup behind the Speaker’s chair in the Executive Council Chamber ten stories below. The two thousand seats had been almost all empty at 1000, when Council had convened. Fifteen minutes later, the news had broken; now, at 1430, a good three quarters of the seats were occupied. He could see, in the aisles, the gold-plated robot pages gliding back and forth, receiving and delivering messages. One had just slid up to the seat of Councilman Hasthor Flan, and Hasthor was speaking urgently into the recorder mouthpiece. Another message for him, he supposed; he’d gotten at least a score such calls since the crisis had developed.</p>
				<p>People were going to start wondering, he thought. This situation should have been perfect for his purposes; as leader of the Opposition he could easily make himself the next General Manager, if he exploited this scandal properly. He listened for a while to the Centrist-Management member who was speaking; he could rip that fellow’s arguments to shreds in a hundred words⁠—but he didn’t dare. The Management was taking exactly the line Salgath Trod wanted the whole Council to take: treat this affair as an isolated and extraordinary occurrence, find a couple of convenient scapegoats, cobble up some explanation acceptable to the public, and forget it. He wondered what had happened to the imbecile who had transposed those Kholghoor Sector slaves onto an exploited timeline. Ought to be shanghaied to the Khiftan Sector and sold to the priests of Fasif!</p>
				<p>A buzzer sounded, and for an instant he thought it would be the message he had seen Hasthor Fan recording. Then he realized that it was the buzzer for the private door, which could only be operated by someone with a special identity sign. He pressed a button and unlocked the door.</p>
				<p>The young man in the loose wraparound tunic who entered was a stranger. At least, his face and his voice were strange, but voices could be mechanically altered, and a skilled cosmetician could render any face unrecognizable. He looked like a student, or a minor commercial executive, or an engineer, or something like that. Of course, his tunic bulged slightly under the left armpit, but even the most respectable tunics showed occasional weapon-bulges.</p>
				<p>“Good afternoon, councilman,” the newcomer said, sitting down across the desk from Salgath Trod. “I was just talking to⁠ ⁠… somebody we both know.”</p>
				<p>Salgath Trod offered cigarettes, lighted his visitor’s and then his own.</p>
				<p>“What does Our Mutual Friend think about all this?” he asked, gesturing toward the screen.</p>
				<p>“Our Mutual Friend isn’t at all happy about it.”</p>
				<p>“You think, perhaps, that I’m bursting into wild huzzas?” Salgath Trod asked. “If I were to act as everybody expects me to, I’d be down there on the floor, now, clawing into the Management tooth and nail. All my adherents are wondering why I’m not. So are all my opponents, and before long one of them is going to guess the reason.”</p>
				<p>“Well, why not go down?” the stranger asked. “Our Mutual Friend thinks it would be an excellent idea. The leak couldn’t be stopped, and it’s gone so far already that the Management will never be able to play it down. So the next best thing is to try to exploit it.”</p>
				<p>Salgath Trod smiled mirthlessly. “So I am to get in front of it, and lead it in the right direction? Fine⁠ ⁠… as long as I don’t stumble over something. If I do, it’ll go over me like a Fifth Level bison-herd.”</p>
				<p>“Don’t worry about that,” the stranger laughed reassuringly. “There are others on the floor who are also friends of Our Mutual Friend. Here: what you’d better do is attack the Paratime Police, especially Tortha Karf and Verkan Vall. Accuse them of negligence and incompetence, and, by implication, of collusion, and demand a special committee to investigate. And try to get a motion for a confidence vote passed. A motion to censure the Management, say⁠—”</p>
				<p>Salgath Trod nodded. “It would delay things, at least. And if Our Mutual Friend can keep properly covered, I might be able to overturn the Management.” He looked at the screen again. “That old fool of a Nanthav is just getting started; it’ll be an hour before I could get recognized. Plenty of time to get a speech together. Something short and vicious⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You’ll have to be careful. It won’t do, with your political record, to try to play down these stories of a gigantic criminal conspiracy. That’s too close to the Management line. And at the same time, you want to avoid saying anything that would get Verkan Vall and Tortha Karf started off on any new lines of investigation.”</p>
				<p>Salgath Trod nodded. “Just depend on me; I’ll handle it.”</p>
				<p>After the stranger had gone, he shut off the sound reception, relying on visual dumb-show to keep him informed of what was going on on the Council floor. He didn’t like the situation. It was too easy to say the wrong thing. If only he knew more about the shadowy figures whose messengers used his private door⁠—</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Coru-hin-Irigod held his aching head in both hands, as though he were afraid it would fall apart, and blinked in the sunlight from the window. Lord Safar, how much of that sweet brandy had he drunk, last night? He sat on the edge of the bed for a moment, trying to think. Then, suddenly apprehensive, he thrust his hand under his pillow. The heavy four-barreled pistols were there, all right, but⁠—<em>The money!</em></p>
				<p>He rummaged frantically among the bedding, and among his clothes, piled on the floor, but the leather bag was nowhere to be found. Two thousand gold <i xml:lang="und">obus</i>, the price of a hundred slaves. He snatched up one of the pistols, his headache forgotten. Then he laughed and tossed the pistol down again. Of course! He’d given the bag to the plantation manager, what was his outlandish name, Dosu Golan, to keep for him before the drinking bout had begun. It was safely waiting for him in the plantation strong box. Well, nothing like a good scare to make a man forget a brandy head, anyhow. And there was something else, something very nice⁠—</p>
				<p>Oh, yes, there it was, beside the bed. He picked up the beautiful gleaming repeater, pulled down the lever far enough to draw the cartridge halfway out of the chamber, and closed it again, lowering the hammer. Those two Jeseru traders from the North, what were their names? Ganadara and Atarazola. That was a stroke of luck, meeting them here. They’d given him this lovely rifle, and they were going to accompany him and his men back to Careba; they had a hundred such rifles, and two hundred six-shot revolvers, and they wanted to trade for slaves. The Lord Safar bless them both, wouldn’t they be welcome at Careba!</p>
				<p>He looked at the sunlight falling through the window on the still recumbent form of his companion, Faru-hin-Obaran. Outside, he could hear the sounds of the plantation coming to life⁠—an ax thudding on wood, the clatter of pans from the kitchens. Crossing to Faru-hin-Obaran’s bed, he grasped the sleeper by the ankle, tugging.</p>
				<p>“Waken, Faru!” he shouted. “Get up and clear the fumes from your head! We start back to Careba today!”</p>
				<p>Faru swore groggily and pushed himself into a sitting position, fumbling on the floor for his trousers.</p>
				<p>“What day’s this?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“The day after we went to bed, ninny!” Then Coru-hin-Irigod wrinkled his brow. He could remember, clearly enough, the sale of the slaves, but after that⁠—Oh, well, he’d been drinking; it would all come back to him, after a while.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Verkan Vall rubbed his hand over his face wearily, started to light another cigarette, and threw it across the room in disgust. What he needed was a drink⁠—a long drink of cool, tart white wine, laced with brandy⁠—and then he needed to sleep.</p>
				<p>“We’re absolutely nowhere!” Ranthar Jard said. “Of course they’re operating on timelines we’ve never penetrated. The fact that they’re supplying the Croutha with guns proves that; there isn’t a firearm on any of the timelines our people are legitimately exploiting. And there are only about three billion timelines on this belt of the Croutha invasion⁠—”</p>
				<p>“If we could think of a way to reduce it to some specific area of paratime⁠—” one of Ranthar Jard’s deputies began.</p>
				<p>“That’s precisely what we’ve been trying to do, Klav,” Vall said. “We haven’t done it.”</p>
				<p>Dalla, who had withdrawn from the discussion and was on a couch at the side of the room, surrounded by reports and abstracts and summaries, looked up.</p>
				<p>“I took hours and hours of hypno-mech on Kholghoor Sector religions, before I went out on that wild-goose chase for psychokinesis and precognition data,” she said. “About six or eight hundred years ago, there were religious wars and heresies and religious schisms all over the Kharanda country. No matter how uniform the Kholghoor Sector may be otherwise, there are dozens and dozens of small belts and sub-sectors of different religions or sects or god-cults.”</p>
				<p>“That’s right,” Ranthar Jard agreed, brightening. “We have hagiologists who know all that stuff; we’ll have a couple of them interrogate those slaves. I don’t know how much they can get out of them⁠—lot of peasants, won’t be up on the theological niceties⁠—but a synthesis of what we get from the lot of them⁠—”</p>
				<p>“That’s an idea,” Vall agreed. “About the first idea we’ve had, here⁠—Oh, how about politics, too? Check on who’s the king, what the stories about the royal family are, that sort of thing.”</p>
				<p>Ranthar Jard looked at the map on the wall. “The Croutha have only gotten halfway to Nharkan, here. Say we transpose detectives in at night on some of these timelines we think are promising, and check up at the tax-collection offices on a big landowner north of Jhirda named Ghromdour? That might get us something.”</p>
				<p>“Well, I don’t want you to think we’re trying to get out of work, Chief’s Assistant,” one of the deputies said, “but is there any real necessity for our trying to locate the Wizard Trader timelines? If you can get them from the Esaron Sector, it’ll be the same, won’t it?”</p>
				<p>“Marv, in this business you never depend on just one lead,” Ranthar Jard told him. “And beside, when Skordran Kirv’s gang hits the base of operations in North America, there’s no guarantee that they may not have time to send off a radio warning to the crowd at the base here in India. We have to hit both places at once.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that, too,” Vall said. “But the main thing is to get these Wizard Trader camps on the Kholghoor Sector cleaned out. How are you fixed for men and equipment, for a big raid, Jard?”</p>
				<p>Ranthar Jard shrugged. “I can get about five hundred men with conveyers, including a couple of two-hundred-footers to carry airboats,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Not enough. Skordran Kirv has one complete armored brigade, one airborne infantry brigade, and an air cavalry regiment, with Ghaldron-Hesthor equipment for a simultaneous transposition,” Vall said.</p>
				<p>“Where in blazes did he get them all?” Ranthar Jard demanded.</p>
				<p>“They’re guard troops, from Service Sector and Industrial Sector. We’ll get you the same sort of a force. I only hope we don’t have another Prole insurrection while they’re away⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Well, don’t think I’m trying to argue policy with you,” Ranthar Jard said, “but that could raise a dreadful stink on Home Timeline. Especially on top of this news-break about the slave trade.”</p>
				<p>“We’ll have to take a chance on that,” Vall said. “If you’re worried about what the book says, forget it. We’re throwing the book away, on this operation. Do you realize that this thing is a threat to the whole Paratime Civilization?”</p>
				<p>“Of course I do,” Ranthar Jard said. “I know the doctrine of Paratime Security as well as you or anybody else. The question is, does the public realize it?”</p>
				<p>A buzzer sounded. Ranthar Jard pressed a switch on the intercom-box in front of him and said: “Ranthar here. Well?”</p>
				<p>“Visiphone call, top urgency, just came in for Chief’s Assistant Verkan, from Novilan Equivalent. Where can I put it through, sir?”</p>
				<p>“Here; booth seven.” Ranthar Jard pointed across the room, nodding to Vall. “In just a moment.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Gathon Dard and Antrath Alv⁠—temporary local aliases, Ganadara and Atarazola⁠—sat relaxed in their saddles, swaying to the motion of their horses. They wore the rust-brown hooded cloaks of the northern Jeseru people, in sober contrast to the red and yellow and blue striped robes and sunbonnets of the Caleras in whose company they rode. They carried short repeating carbines in saddle scabbards, and heavy revolvers and long knives on their belts, and each led six heavily-laden packhorses.</p>
				<p>Coru-hin-Irigod, riding beside Ganadara, pointed up the trail ahead.</p>
				<p>“From up there,” he said, speaking in Acalan, the lingua franca of the North American West Coast on that sector, “we can see across the valley to Careba. It will be an hour, as we ride, with the packhorses. Then we will rest, and drink wine, and feast.”</p>
				<p>Ganadara nodded. “It was the guidance of our gods⁠—and yours, Coru-hin-Irigod⁠—that we met. Such slaves as you sold at the outlanders’ plantation would bring a fine price in the North. The men are strong, and have the look of good fieldworkers; the women are comely and well-formed. Though I fear that my wife would little relish it did I bring home such handmaidens.”</p>
				<p>Coru-hin-Irigod laughed. “For your wife, I will give you one of our riding whips.” He leaned to the side, slashing at a cactus with his quirt. “We in Careba have no trouble with our wives, about handmaidens or anything else.”</p>
				<p>“By Safar, if you doubt your welcome at Careba, wait till you show your wares,” another Calera said. “Rifles and revolvers like those come to our country seldom, and then old and battered, sold or stolen many times before we see them. Rifles that fire seven times without taking butt from shoulder!” He invoked the name of the Great Lord Safar again.</p>
				<p>The trail widened and leveled; they all came up abreast, with the packhorses strung out behind, and sat looking across the valley to the adobe walls of the town that perched on the opposite ridge. After a while, riders began dismounting and checking and tightening saddle-girths; a couple of Caleras helped Ganadara and Atarazola inspect their packhorses. When they remounted, Atarazola bowed his head, lifting his left sleeve to cover his mouth, and muttered into it at some length. The Caleras looked at him curiously, and Coru-hin-Irigod inquired of Ganadara what he did.</p>
				<p>“He prays,” Ganadara said. “He thanks our gods that we have lived to see your town, and asks that we be spared to bring many more trains of rifles and ammunition up this trail.”</p>
				<p>The slaver nodded understandingly. The Caleras were a pious people, too, who believed in keeping on friendly terms with the gods.</p>
				<p>“May Safar’s hand work with the hands of your gods for it,” he said, making what, to a non-Calera, would have been an extremely ribald sign.</p>
				<p>“The gods watch over us,” Atarazola said, lifting his head. “They are near us even now; they have spoken words of comfort in my ear.”</p>
				<p>Ganadara nodded. The gods to whom his partner prayed were a couple of paratime policemen, crouching over a radio a mile or so down the ridge.</p>
				<p>“My brother,” he told Coru-hin-Irigod, “is much favored by our gods. Many people come to him to pray for them.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. So you told me, now that I think on it.” That detail had been included in the pseudo-memories he had been given under hypnosis. “I serve Safar, as do all Caleras, but I have heard that the Jeserus’ gods are good gods, dealing honestly with their servants.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>An hour later, under the walls of the town, Coru-hin-Irigod drew one of his pistols and fired all four barrels in rapid succession into the air, shouting, “Open! Open for Coru-hin-Irigod, and for the Jeseru traders, Ganadara and Atarazola, who are with him!”</p>
				<p>A head, black-bearded and sun-bonneted, appeared between the brick merlons of the wall above the gate, shouted down a welcome, and then turned away to bawl orders. The gate slid aside, and, after the caravan had passed through, naked slaves pushed the massive thing shut again. Although they were familiar with the interior of the town, from photographs taken with boomerang-balls⁠—automatic-return transposition spheres like message-balls⁠—they looked around curiously. The central square was thronged⁠—Caleras in striped robes, people from the south and east in baggy trousers and embroidered shirts, mountaineers in deerskins. A slave market was in progress, and some hundred-odd items of human merchandise were assembled in little groups, guarded by their owners and inspected by prospective buyers. They seemed to be all natives of that geographic and paratemporal area.</p>
				<p>“Don’t even look at those,” Coru-hin-Irigod advised. “They are but culls; the market is almost over. We’ll go to the house of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, where all the considerable men gather, and you will find those who will be able to trade slaves worthy of the goods you have with you. Meanwhile, let my people take your horses and packs to my house; you shall be my guests while you stay in Careba.”</p>
				<p>It was perfectly safe to trust Coru-hin-Irigod. He was a murderer and a brigand and a slaver, but he would never incur the scorn of men and the curse of the gods by dealing foully with a guest. The horses and packs were led away by his retainers; Ganadara and Atarazola pushed their horses after his and Faru-hin-Obaran’s through the crowd.</p>
				<p>The house of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, like every other building in Careba, was flat-roofed, adobe-walled and windowless except for narrow rifle-slits. The wide double-gate stood open, and five or six heavily armed Caleras lounged just inside. They greeted Coru and Faru by name, and the strangers by their assumed nationality. The four rode through, into what appeared to be the stables, turning their horses over to slaves, who took them away. There were between fifty and sixty other horses in the place.</p>
				<p>Divesting themselves of their weapons in an anteroom at the head of a flight of steps, they passed under an arch and into a wide, shady patio, where thirty or forty men stood about or squatted on piles of cushions, smoking cheroots, drinking from silver cups, talking in a continuous babel. Most of them were in Calera dress, though there were men of other communities and nations, in other garb. As they moved across the patio, Gathon Dard caught snatches of conversations about deals in slaves, and horse trades, about bandit raids and blood feuds, about women and horses and weapons.</p>
				<p>An old man with a white beard and an unusually clean robe came over to intercept them.</p>
				<p>“Ha, lord of my daughter, you’re back at last. We had begun to fear for you,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Nothing to fear, father of my wife,” Coru-hin-Irigod replied. “We sold the slaves for a good price, and tarried the night feasting in good company. Such good company that we brought some of it with us⁠—Atarazola and Ganadara, men of the Jeseru; Cavu-hin-Avoran, whose daughter mothered my sons.” He took his father-in-law by the sleeve and pulled him aside, motioning Gathon Dard and Antrath Alv to follow.</p>
				<p>“They brought weapons; they want outland slaves, of the sort I took to sell in the Big Valley country,” he whispered. “The weapons are repeating rifles from across the ocean, and six-shot revolvers. They also have much ammunition.”</p>
				<p>“Oh, Safar bless you!” the white-beard cried, his eyes brightening. “Name your own price; satisfy yourselves that we have dealt fairly with you; go, and return often again! Come, lord of my daughter; let us make them known to Nebu-hin-Abenoz. But not a word about the kind of weapons you have, strangers, until we can speak privately. Say only that you have rifles to trade.”</p>
				<p>Gathon Dard nodded. Evidently there was some sort of power-struggle going on in Careba; Coru-hin-Irigod and his wife’s father were of the party of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, and wanted the repeaters and six-shooters for themselves.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Nebu-hin-Abenoz, swarthy, hook-nosed, with a square-cut graying beard, lounged in a low chair across the patio; near him four or five other Caleras sat or squatted or reclined, all smoking the rank black tobacco of the country and drinking wine or brandy. Their conversation ceased as Cavu-hin-Avoran and the others approached. The chief of Careba listened to the introduction, then heaved himself to his feet and clapped the newcomers on the shoulders.</p>
				<p>“Good, good!” he said. “We know you Jeseru people; you’re honest traders. You come this far into our mountains too seldom. We can trade with you. We need weapons. As for the sort of slaves you want, we have none too many now, but in eight days we will have plenty. If you stay with us that long⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Careba is a pleasant place to be,” Ganadara said. “We can wait.”</p>
				<p>“What sort of weapons have you?” the chief asked.</p>
				<p>“Pistols and rifles, lord of my father’s sister,” Coru-hin-Irigod answered for them. “The packs have been taken to my house, where our friends will stay. We can bring a few to show you, the hour after evening prayers.”</p>
				<p>Nebu-hin-Abenoz shot a keen glance at his brother-in-law’s son and nodded. “Or, better, I will come to your house then; thus I can see the whole load. How will that be?”</p>
				<p>“Better; I will be there, too,” Cavu-hin-Avoran said, then turned to Gathon Dard and Antrath Alv. “You have been long on the road; come, let us drink cool wine, and then we will eat,” he said. “Until this evening, Nebu-hin-Abenoz.”</p>
				<p>He led his son-in-law and the traders to one side, where several kegs stood on trestles with cups and flagons beside them. They filled a flagon, took a cup apiece, and went over to a pile of cushions at one side.</p>
				<p>As they did, three men came pushing through the crowd toward Nebu-hin-Abenoz’s seat. They wore a costume unfamiliar to Gathon Dard⁠—little round caps with red and green streamers behind, and long, wide-sleeved white gowns⁠—and one of them had gold rings in his ears.</p>
				<p>“Nebu-hin-Abenoz?” one of them said, bowing. “We are three men of the Usasu cities. We have gold <i xml:lang="und">obus</i> to spend; we seek a beautiful girl, to be first concubine to our king’s son, who is now come to the estate of manhood.”</p>
				<p>Nebu-hin-Abenoz picked up the silver-mounted pipe he had laid aside, and relighted it, frowning.</p>
				<p>“Men of the Usasu, you have a heavy responsibility,” he said. “You have the responsibility for the future of your kingdom, for a boy’s character is more shaped by his first concubine than by his teachers. How old is the boy?”</p>
				<p>“Sixteen, Nebu-hin-Abenoz; the age of manhood among us.”</p>
				<p>“Then you want a girl older, but not much older. She should be versed in the arts of love, but innocent of heart. She should be wise, but teachable; gentle and loving, but with a will of her own⁠—”</p>
				<p>The three men in white gowns were fidgeting. Then, suddenly, like three marionettes on a single string, they put their right hands to their mouths and then plunged them into the left sleeves of their gowns, whipping out knives and then sprang as one upon Nebu-hin-Abenoz, slashing and stabbing.</p>
				<p>Gathon Dard was on his feet at once; he hurled the wine flagon at the three murderers and leaped across the room. Antrath Alv went bounding after him, and by this time three or four of the group around Nebu-hin-Abenoz’s chair had recovered their wits and jumped to their feet. One of the three assailants turned and slashed with his knife, almost disemboweling a Calera who had tried to grapple with him. Before he could free the blade, another Calera brought a brandy bottle down on his head. Gathon Dard sprang upon the back of a second assassin, hooking his left elbow under the fellow’s chin and grabbing the wrist of his knife-hand with his right; the man struggled for an instant, then went limp and fell forward. The third of the trio of murderers was still slashing at the fallen chieftain when Antrath Alv chopped him along the side of the neck with the edge of his hand; he simply dropped and lay still.</p>
				<p>Nebu-hin-Abenoz was dead. He had been slashed and cut and stabbed in twenty places; his throat had been cut at least three times, and he had almost been decapitated. The wounded Calera wasn’t dead yet; however, even if he had been at the moment on the operating table of a First Level Home Timeline hospital, it was doubtful if he could have been saved, and under the circumstances, his life-expectancy could be measured in seconds. Some cushions were placed under his head, and women called to attend him, but he died before they arrived.</p>
				<p>The three assassins were also dead. Except for a few cuts on the scalp of the one who had been felled with the bottle, there was not a mark on any of them. Cavu-hin-Avoran kicked one of them in the face and cursed.</p>
				<p>“We killed the skunks too quickly!” he cried. “We should have overcome them alive, and then taken our time about dealing with them as they deserved.” He went on to specify the nature of their deserts. “Such infamy!”</p>
				<p>“Well, I’ll swear I didn’t think a little tap like I gave that one would kill him,” the bottle-wielder excused himself. “Of course, I was thinking only of Nebu-hin-Abenoz, Safar receive him⁠—”</p>
				<p>Antrath Alv bent over the one he had hand-chopped.</p>
				<p>“I didn’t kill this one,” he said. “The way I hit him, if I had, his neck would be broken, and it’s not. See?” He twisted at the dead man’s neck. “I think they took poison before they drew their knives.”</p>
				<p>“I saw all of them put their hands to their mouths!” a Calera exclaimed. “And look; see how their jaws are clenched.” He picked up one of the knives and used it to pry the dead man’s jaws apart, sniffing at his lips and looking into his mouth. “Look, his teeth and his tongue are discolored; there is a strange smell, too.”</p>
				<p>Antrath Alv sniffed, then turned to his partner. “Halatane,” he whispered. Gathon Dard nodded. That was a First Level poison; paratimers often carried halatane capsules on the more barbaric timelines, as a last insurance against torture.</p>
				<p>“But, Holy Name of Safar, what manner of men were these?” Coru-hin-Irigod demanded. “There are those I would risk my life to kill, but I would not throw it away thus.”</p>
				<p>“They came knowing that we would kill them, and took the poison that they might die quickly and without pain,” a Calera said.</p>
				<p>“Or that your tortures would not wring from them the names and nation of those who sent them,” an elderly man in the dress of a rancher from the southeast added. “If I were you, I would try to find out who these enemies are, and the sooner the better.”</p>
				<p>Gathon Dard was examining one of the knives⁠—a folding knife with a broad single-edged blade, locked open with a spring; the handle was of tortoise shell, bolstered with brass.</p>
				<p>“In all my travels,” he said, “I never saw a knife of this workmanship before. Tell me, Coru-hin-Irigod, do you know from what country these outland slaves of Nebu-hin-Abenoz’s come?”</p>
				<p>“You think that might have something to do with it?” the Calera asked.</p>
				<p>“It could. I think that these people might not have been born slaves, but people taken captive. Suppose, at some time, there had been sold to Nebu-hin-Abenoz, and sold elsewhere by him, one who was a person of consequence⁠—the son of a king, or the priest of some god,” Gathon Dard suggested.</p>
				<p>“By Safar, yes! And now that nation, wherever it is, is at blood-feud with us,” Cavu-hin-Avoran said. “This must be thought about; it is an ill thing to have unknown enemies.”</p>
				<p>“Look!” a Calera who had begun to strip the three dead men cried. “These are not of the Usasu cities, or any other people of this land. See, they are uncircumcised!”</p>
				<p>“Many of the slaves whom Nebu-hin-Abenoz brought to Careba from the hills have been uncircumcised,” Coru-hin-Irigod said. “Jeseru, I think you have your sights on the heart of it.” He frowned. “Now, think you, will those who had this done be satisfied, or will they carry on their hatred against all of us?”</p>
				<p>“A hard question,” Antrath Alv said. “You Caleras do not serve our gods, but you are our friends. Suffer me to go apart and pray; I would take counsel with the gods, that they may aid us all in this.”</p>

				<h3 epub:type="z3998:roman ordinal">II</h3>
				<p>It was full daylight, but the sun was hidden; a thin rain fell on the landing around at Police Terminal Dhergabar Equivalent when Vall and Dalla left the rocket. Across the black lavalike pavement, they could see the bulky form of Tortha Karf, hunched under a long cloak, with his flat cap pulled down over his brow. He shook hands with Vall and kissed cheeks with Dalla when they joined him.</p>
				<p>“Car’s over here,” he said, nodding toward the waiting vehicle. “Yesterday wasn’t one of our better days, was it?”</p>
				<p>“No. It wasn’t.” Vall agreed. They climbed into the car, and the driver lifted straight up to two thousand feet and turned, soaring down to land on the Chief’s Headquarters Building, a mile away. “We’re not completely stopped, sir. Ranthar Jard is working on a few ideas that may lead him to the Kholghoor timelines where the Wizard Traders are operating. If we can’t get them through their output, we may nail them at the intake.”</p>
				<p>“Unless they’ve gotten the wind up and closed down all their operations,” Tortha Karf said.</p>
				<p>“I doubt if they’ve done that, Chief,” Vall replied. “We don’t know who these people are, of course, and it’s hard to judge their reactions, but they’re willing to take chances for big gains. I believe they think they’re safe, now that they’ve closed out the compromised timeline and killed the only witness against them.”</p>
				<p>“Well, what’s Ranthar Jard doing?”</p>
				<p>“Trying to locate the sub-sector and probability belt from what the slaves can tell him about their religious beliefs, about the local king, and the prince of Jhirda, and the noble families of the neighborhood,” Vall said. “When he has it localized as closely as he can, he’s going to start pelting the whole paratemporal area with photographic auto-return balls dropped from aircars on Police Terminal over the spatial equivalents of a couple of Croutha-conquered cities. As soon as he gets a photo that shows Croutha with firearms, he’ll have a Wizard Trader timeline.”</p>
				<p>“Sounds simple,” the Chief said. The car landed, and he helped Dalla out. “I suppose both you and he know how many chances against one he has of finding anything.” They went over to an antigrav-shaft and floated down to the floor on which Tortha Karf had a duplicate of the office in the Paratime Building on Home Timeline. “It’s the only chance we have, though.”</p>
				<p>“There’s one thing that bothers me,” Dalla said, as they entered the office and went back behind the horseshoe-shaped desk. “I understand that the news about this didn’t break on Home Timeline till the late morning of One-Six-One Day. Nebu-hin-Abenoz was murdered at about 1700 local time, which would be 0100 this morning Dhergabar time. That would give this gang fourteen hours to hear the news, transmit it to their base, and get these three men hypno-conditioned, disguised, transposed to this Esaron Sector timeline, and into Careba.” She shook her head. “That’s pretty fast work.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf looked sidewise at Verkan Vall. “Your girl has the makings of a cop, Vall,” he commented.</p>
				<p>“She’s been a big help, on Esaron and Kholghoor Sectors,” Vall said. “She wants to stay with it and help me; I’ll be very glad to have her with me.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf nodded. He knew, too, that Dalla wouldn’t want to have to go back to Home Timeline and wait the long investigation out.</p>
				<p>“Of course; we can use all the help we can get. I think we can get a lot from Dalla. Fix her up with some kind of a title and police status⁠—technical-expert, assistant, or something like that.” He clasped hands, man-fashion, with her. “Glad to have you on the cops with us, Dalla,” he said. Then he turned to Vall. “There was almost twenty-four hours between the time I heard about this and when this blasted Yandar Yadd got hold of the story. Of all the infernal, irresponsible⁠—” He almost choked with indignation. “And it was another fourteen hours between the time Skordran sent in his report and I heard about it.”</p>
				<p>“Golzan Doth sent in a report to his company about the same time Skordran Kirv made his first report to his Sector-Regional Subchief.” Vall mentioned.</p>
				<p>“That might be it,” Tortha Karf considered. “I wish there were another explanation, because that implies a very extensive intelligence network, which means a big organization. But I’m afraid that’s it. I wish I could pull in everybody in Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs who handled that report, and narco-hypnotize them. Of course, we can’t do things like that on Home Timeline, and with the political situation what it is now⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Why, what’s been happening, Chief?”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf swore with weary bitterness. “Salgath Trod’s what’s been happening. At first, after Yandar Yadd broke the story on the air, there was just a lot of unorganized Opposition sniping in Council; Salgath waited till the middle of the afternoon, when the Management members were beginning to rally, and took the floor. The Centrists and Right Moderates were trying the appeal-to-reason approach; that did as much good as trying to put out a Fifth Level forest fire with a hand-extinguisher. Finally. Salgath got a motion of censure against the Management recognized. That means a confidence vote in ten days. Salgath has a rabble of Leftists and dissident Centrists with him; I doubt if he can muster enough votes to overturn the Management, but it’s going to make things rough for us.”</p>
				<p>“Which may be just the reason Salgath started this uproar,” Vall suggested.</p>
				<p>“That,” Tortha Karf said, “is being considered; there is a discreet inquiry being made into Salgath Trod’s associates, his sources of income, and so on. Nothing has turned up as yet, but we have hopes.”</p>
				<p>“I believe,” Vall said, “that we have a better chance right on Home Timeline than outtime.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf looked up sharply. “So?” he asked.</p>
				<p>Vall was stuffing tobacco into a pipe. “Yes. Chief. We have a big criminal organization⁠—let’s call it the Slave Trust, for a convenience-label. The people who run it aren’t stupid. The fact that they’ve been shipping slaves to the Esaron Sector for ten years before we found out about it proves that. So does the speed with which they got rid of this Nebu-hin-Abenoz, right in front of a pair of our detectives. For that matter, so does the speed with which they moved in to exploit this Croutha invasion of Kholghoor Sector India.</p>
				<p>“Well, I’ve studied illegal and subversive organizations all over paratime, and among the really successful ones, there are a few uniform principles. One is cellular organization⁠—small groups, acting in isolation from one another, cooperating with other cells but ignorant of their composition. Another is the principle of no upward contact⁠—leaders contacting their subordinates through contact-blocks and ignorant intermediaries. And another is a willingness to kill off anybody who looks like a potential betrayer or forced witness. The late Nebu-hin-Abenoz, for instance.</p>
				<p>“I’ll be willing to bet that if we pick up some of these Wizard Traders, say, or a gang that’s selling slaves to some Nebu-hin-Abenoz personality on some other timeline, and narco-hypnotize them, all they’ll be able to do will be name a few immediate associates, and the group leader will know that he’s contacted from time to time by some stranger with orders, and that he can make emergency contacts only through some blind accommodation-address. The men who are running this are right on Home Timeline, many of them in positions of prominence, and if we can catch one of them and narco-hyp him, we can start a chain-reaction of disclosures all through this Slave Trust.”</p>
				<p>“How are we going to get at these top men?” Tortha Karf wanted to know. “Advertise for them on telecast?”</p>
				<p>“They’ll leave traces; they won’t be able to avoid it. I think, right now, that Salgath Trod is one of them. I think there are other prominent politicians, and business people. Look for irregularities and peculiarities in outtime currency-exchange transactions. For instance, to sections in Esaron Sector <i xml:lang="und">obus</i>. Or big gold bullion transactions.”</p>
				<p>“Yes. And if they have any really elaborate outtime bases, they’ll need equipment that can only be gotten on Home Timeline,” Tortha Karf added. “Paratemporal conveyer parts, and field-conductor mesh. You can’t just walk into a hardware store and buy that sort of thing.”</p>
				<p>Dalla leaned forward to drop her cigarette ash into a tray.</p>
				<p>“Try looking into the Bureau of Psychological Hygiene,” she suggested. “That’s where you’ll really strike it rich.”</p>
				<p>Vall and Tortha Karf both turned abruptly and looked at her for an instant.</p>
				<p>“Go on,” Tortha Karf encouraged. “This sounds interesting.”</p>
				<p>“The people back of this,” Dalla said, “are definitely classifiable as criminals. They may never perform a criminal act themselves, but they give orders for and profit from such acts, and they must possess the motivation and psychology of criminals. We define people as criminals when they suffer from psychological aberrations of an antisocial character, usually paranoid⁠—excessive egoism, disregard for the rights of others, inability to recognize the social necessity for mutual cooperation and confidence. On Home Timeline, we have universal psychological testing, for the purpose of detecting and eliminating such characteristics.”</p>
				<p>“It seems to have failed in this case,” Tortha Karf began, then snapped his fingers. “Of course! How blasted silly can I get, when I’m not trying?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, of course,” Verkan Vall agreed. “Find out how these people missed being spotted by psychotesting; that’ll lead us to <em>who</em> missed being tested adequately, and also who got into the Bureau of Psychological Hygiene who didn’t belong there.”</p>
				<p>“I think you ought to give an investigation of the whole <abbr>BuPsychHyg</abbr> setup very high priority,” Dalla said. “A psychotest is only as good as the people who give it, and if we have criminals administering these tests⁠—”</p>
				<p>“We have our friends on Executive Council,” Tortha Karf said. “I’ll see that that point is raised when Council reconvenes.” He looked at the clock. “That’ll be in three hours, by the way. If it doesn’t accomplish another thing, it’ll put Salgath Trod in the middle. He can’t demand an investigation of the Paratime Police out of one side of his mouth and oppose an investigation of Psychological Hygiene out of the other. Now what else have we to talk about?”</p>
				<p>“Those hundred slaves we got off the Esaron Sector,” Vall said. “What are we going to do with them? And if we locate the timeline the slavers have their bases on, we’ll have hundreds, probably thousands, more.”</p>
				<p>“We can’t sort them out and send them back to their own timelines, even if that would be desirable,” Tortha Karf decided. “Why, settle them somewhere on the Service Sector. I know, the Paratime Transposition Code limits the Service Sector to natives of timelines below second-order barbarism, but the Paratime Transposition Code has been so badly battered by this business that a few more minor literal infractions here and there won’t make any difference. Where are they now?”</p>
				<p>“Police Terminal, Nharkan Equivalent.”</p>
				<p>“Better hold them there, for the time being. We may have to open a new ServSec timeline to take care of all the slaves we find, if we can locate the outtime base line these people are using⁠—Vall, this thing’s too big to handle as a routine operation, along with our other work. You take charge of it. Set up your headquarters here, and help yourself to anything in the way of personnel and equipment you need. And bear in mind that this confidence vote is coming up in ten days⁠—on the morning of One-Seven-Two Day. I’m not asking for any miracles, but if we don’t get this thing cleared up by then, we’re in for trouble.”</p>
				<p>“I realize that, sir. Dalla, you’d better go back to Home Timeline, with the Chief,” he said. “There’s nothing you can do to help me, here, at present. Get some rest, and then try to wangle an invitation for the two of us to dinner at Thalvan Dras’ apartments this evening.” He turned back to Tortha Karf. “Even if he never pays any attention to business, Dras still owns Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs,” he said. “He might be able to find out, or help us find out, how the story about those slaves leaked out of his company.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that won’t take much doing,” Dalla said. “If there’s as much excitement on Home Timeline as I think, Dras would turn somersaults and jump through hoops to get us to one of his dinners, right now.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Salgath Trod pushed the litter of papers and record-tape spools to one side impatiently.</p>
				<p>“Well, what else did you expect?” he demanded. “This was the logical next move. <abbr>BuPsychHyg</abbr> is supposed to detect anybody who believes in looking out for his own interests first, and condition him into a pious law-abiding sucker. Well, the sacred Bureau of Sucker-Makers slipped up on a lot of us. It’s a natural alibi for Tortha Karf.”</p>
				<p>“It’s also a lot of grief for all of us,” the young man in the wraparound tunic added. “I don’t want my psychotests reviewed by some duty-struck bigot who can’t be reasoned with, and neither do you.”</p>
				<p>“I’m getting something organized to counter that,” Salgath Trod said. “I’m going to attack the whole scientific basis of psychotesting. There’s <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Frasthor Klav; he’s always contended that what are called criminal tendencies are the result of the individual’s total environment, and that psychotesting and personality-analysis are valueless, because the total environment changes from day to day, even from hour to hour⁠—”</p>
				<p>“That won’t do,” the nameless young man who was the messenger of somebody equally nameless retorted. “Frasthor’s a crackpot; no reputable psychologist or psychist gives his opinions a moment’s consideration. And besides, we don’t want to attack Psychological Hygiene. The people in it with whom we can do business are our safeguard; they’ve given all of us a clean bill of mental health, and we have papers to prove it. What we have to do is to make it appear that that incident on the Esaron Sector is all there is to this, and also involve the Paratime Police themselves. The slavers are all paracops. It isn’t the fault of <abbr>BuPsychHyg</abbr>, because the Paratime Police have their own psychotesting staff. That’s where the trouble is; the paracops haven’t been adequately testing their own personnel.”</p>
				<p>“Now how are you going to do that?” Salgath Trod asked disdainfully.</p>
				<p>“You’ll take the floor, the first thing tomorrow, and utilize these new revelations about the Wizard Traders. You’ll accuse the Paratime Police of being the Wizard Traders themselves. Why not? They have their own paratemporal transposition equipment shops on Police Terminal, they have facilities for manufacturing duplicates of any kind of outtime items, like the firearms, for instance, and they know which timelines on which sectors are being exploited by legitimate paratime traders and which aren’t. What’s to prevent a gang of unscrupulous paracops from moving in on a few unexploited Kholghoor timelines, buying captives from the Croutha, and shipping them to the Esaron Sector?”</p>
				<p>“Then why would they let a thing like this get out?” Salgath Trod inquired.</p>
				<p>“Somebody slipped up and moved a lot of slaves onto an exploited Esaron timeline. Or, rather, Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs established a plantation on a timeline they were shipping slaves to. Parenthetically, that’s what really did happen; the mistake our people made was in not closing out that timeline as soon as Consolidated Foodstuffs moved in,” the young man said.</p>
				<p>“So, this Skordran Kirv, who is a dumb boy who doesn’t know what the score is, found these slaves and blatted about it to this Golzan Doth, and Golzan reported it to his company, and it couldn’t be hushed up, so now Tortha Karf is trying to scare the public with ghost stories about a gigantic paratemporal conspiracy, to get more appropriations and more power.”</p>
				<p>“How long do you think I’d get away with that?” Salgath Trod demanded. “I can only stretch parliamentary immunity so far. Sooner or later, I’d have to make formal charges to a special judicial committee, and that would mean narco-hypnosis, and then it would all come out.”</p>
				<p>“You’ll have proof,” the young man said. “We’ll produce a couple of these Kharandas whom Verkan Vall didn’t get hold of. Under narco-hypnosis, they’ll testify that they saw a couple of Wizard Traders take their robes off. Under the robes were Paratime Police uniforms. Do you follow me?”</p>
				<p>Salgath Trod made a noise of angry disgust.</p>
				<p>“That’s ridiculous! I suppose these Kharandas will be given what is deludedly known as memory obliteration, and a set of pseudo-memories; how long do you think that would last? About three ten-days. There is no such thing as memory obliteration; there’s memory-suppression, and pseudo-memory overlay. You can’t get behind that with any quickie narco-hypnosis in the back room of any police post, I’ll admit that,” he said. “But a skilled psychist can discover, inside of five minutes, when a narco-hypnotized subject is carrying a load of false memories, and in time, and not too much time, all that top layer of false memories and blockages can be peeled off. And then where would we be?”</p>
				<p>“Now wait a minute, Councilman. This isn’t just something I dreamed up,” the visitor said. “This was decided upon at the top. At the very top.”</p>
				<p>“I don’t care whose idea it was,” Salgath Trod snapped. “The whole thing is idiotic, and I won’t have anything to do with it.”</p>
				<p>The visitor’s face froze. All the respect vanished from his manner and tone; his voice was like ice cakes grating together in a winter river.</p>
				<p>“Look, Salgath; this is an Organization order,” he said. “You don’t refuse to obey Organization orders, and you don’t quit the Organization. Now get smart, big boy; do what you’re told to.” He took a spool of record tape from his pocket and laid it on the desk. “Outline for your speech; put it in your own words, but follow it exactly.” He stood watching Salgath Trod for a moment. “I won’t bother telling you what’ll happen to you if you don’t,” he added. “You can figure that out for yourself.”</p>
				<p>With that, he turned and went out the private door. For a while, Salgath Trod sat staring after him. Once he put his hand out toward the spool, then jerked it back as though the thing were radioactive. Once he looked at the clock; it was just 1600.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The green aircar settled onto the landing stage; Verkan Vall, on the front seat beside the driver, opened the door.</p>
				<p>“Want me to call for you later, Assistant Verkan?” the driver asked.</p>
				<p>“No thank you, Drenth. My wife and I are going to a dinner-party, and we’ll probably go night-clubbing afterward. Tomorrow morning, all the anti-Management commentators will be yakking about my carousing around when I ought to be battling the Slave Trust. No use advertising myself with an official car, and giving them a chance to add, ‘at public expense.’ ”</p>
				<p>“Well, have some fun while you can,” the driver advised, reaching for the car-radio phone. “Want me to check you in here, sir?”</p>
				<p>“Yes, if you will. Thank you. Drenth.”</p>
				<p>Kandagro, his human servant, admitted him to the apartment six floors down.</p>
				<p>“Mistress Dalla is dressing,” he said. “She asked me to tell you that you are invited to dinner, this evening, with Thalvan Dras at his apartment.”</p>
				<p>Vall nodded. “Ill talk to her about it now,” he said. “Lay out my dress uniform: short jacket, boots and breeches, and needler.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, master: I’ll go lay out your things and get your bath ready.”</p>
				<p>The servant turned and went into the alcove which gave access to the dressing rooms, turning right into Vall’s. Vall followed him, turning left into his wife’s.</p>
				<p>“Oh, Dalla!” he called.</p>
				<p>“In here!” her voice came out of her bathroom.</p>
				<p>He passed through the dressing room, to find her stretched on a plastic-sheeted couch, while her maid, Rendarra, was rubbing her body vigorously with some pungent-smelling stuff about the consistency of machine-grease. Her face was masked in the stuff, and her hair was covered with an elastic cap. He had always suspected that beauty was the real feminine religion, from the willingness of its devotees to submit to martyrdom for it. She wiggled a hand at him in greeting.</p>
				<p>“How did it go?” she asked.</p>
				<p>“So-so. I organized myself a sort of miniature police force within a police force and I have liaison officers in every organization down to Sector Regional so that I can be informed promptly in case anything new turns up anywhere. What’s been happening on Home Timeline? I picked up a news-summary at Paratime Police Headquarters; it seems that a lot more stuff has leaked out. Kholghoor Sector, Wizard Traders and all. How’d it happen?”</p>
				<p>Dalla rolled over to allow Rendarra to rub the blue-green grease on her back.</p>
				<p>“Consolidated Outtime Foodstuffs let a gang of reporters in, today. I think they’re afraid somebody will accuse them of complicity, and they want to get their side of it before the public. All our crowd are off that Time line except a couple of detectives at the plantation.”</p>
				<p>“I know.” He smiled; Dalla was thinking of the Paratime Police as “our crowd” now. “How about this dinner at Dras’ place?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, that was easy.” She shifted position again. “I just called Dras up and told him that our vacation was off, and he invited us before I could begin hinting. What are you going to wear?”</p>
				<p>“Short-jacket greens; I can carry a needler with that uniform, even wear it at the table. I don’t think it’s smart for me to run around unarmed, even on Home Timeline. Especially on Home Timeline,” he amended. “When’s this affair going to start, and how long will Rendarra take to get that goo off you?”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Salgath Trod left his aircar at the top landing stage of his apartment building and sent it away to the hangars under robot control; he glanced about him as he went toward the antigrav shaft. There were a dozen vehicles in the air above; any of them might have followed him from the Paratime Building. He had no doubt that he had been under constant surveillance from the moment the nameless messenger had delivered the Organization’s ultimatum. Until he delivered that speech, the next morning, or manifested an intention of refusing to do so, however, he would be safe. After that⁠—</p>
				<p>Alone in his office, he had reviewed the situation point by point, and then gone back and reviewed it again; the conclusion was inescapable. The Organization had ordered him to make an accusation which he himself knew to be false; that was the first premise. The conclusion was that he would be killed as soon as he had made it. That was the trouble with being mixed up with that kind of people⁠—you were expendable, and sooner or later, they would decide that they would have to expend you. And what could you do?</p>
				<p>To begin with, an accusation of criminal malfeasance made against a Management or Paratime Commission agency on the floor of Executive Council was tantamount to an accusation made in court; automatically, the accuser became a criminal prosecutor, and would have to repeat his accusation under narco-hypnosis. Then the whole story would come out, bit by bit, back to its beginning in that first illegal deal in Indo-Turanian opium, diverted from trade with the Khiftan Sector and sold on Second Level Luvarian Empire Sector, and the deals in radioactive poisons, and the slave trade. He would be able to name few names⁠—the Organization kept its activities too well compartmented for that⁠—but he could talk of things that had happened, and when, and where, and on what paratemporal areas.</p>
				<p>No. The Organization wouldn’t let that happen, and the only way it could be prevented would be by the death of Salgath Trod, as soon as he had made his speech. All the talk of providing him with corroborative evidence was silly; it had been intended to lead him more trustingly to the slaughter. They’d kill him, of course, in some way that would be calculated to substantiate the story he would no longer be able to repudiate. The killer, who would be promptly rayed dead by somebody else, would wear a Paratime Police uniform, or something like that. That was of no importance, however; by then, he’d be beyond caring.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>One of his three ServSec Prole servants⁠—the slim brown girl who was his housekeeper and hostess, and also his mistress⁠—admitted him to the apartment. He kissed her perfunctorily and closed the door behind him.</p>
				<p>“You’re tired,” she said. “Let me call Nindrandigro and have him bring you chilled wine; lie down and rest until dinner.”</p>
				<p>“No, no; I want brandy.” He went to a cellaret and got out a decanter and goblet, pouring himself a drink. “How soon will dinner be ready?”</p>
				<p>The brown girl squeezed a little golden globe that hung on a chain around her neck; a tiny voice, inside it, repeated: “Eighteen twenty-three ten, eighteen twenty-three eleven, eighteen twenty-three twelve⁠—”</p>
				<p>“In half an hour. It’s still in the robo-chef,” she told him.</p>
				<p>He downed half the goblet-full, set it down, and went to a painting, a brutal scarlet and apple-green abstraction, that hung on the wall. Swinging it aside and revealing the safe behind it, he used his identity-sigil, took out a wad of Paratemporal Exchange Bank notes and gave them to the girl.</p>
				<p>“Here, Zinganna; take these, and take Nindrandigro and Calilla out for the evening. Go where you can all have a good time, and don’t come back till after midnight. There will be some business transacted here, and I want them out of this. Get them out of here as soon as you can; I’ll see to the dinner myself. Spend all of that you want to.”</p>
				<p>The girl riffled through the wad of banknotes. “Why, <em>thank</em> you, Trod!” She threw her arms around his neck and kissed him enthusiastically. “I’ll go tell them at once.”</p>
				<p>“And have a good time, Zinganna; have the best time you possibly can,” he told her, embracing and kissing her. “Now, get out of here; I have to keep my mind on business.”</p>
				<p>When she had gone, he finished his drink and poured another. He drew and checked his needler. Then, after checking the window-shielding and activating the outside viewscreens, he lit a cheroot and sat down at the desk, his goblet and his needler in front of him, to wait until the servants were gone.</p>
				<p>There was only one way out alive. He knew that, and yet he needed brandy, and a great deal of mental effort, to steel himself for it. Psycho-rehabilitation was a dreadful thing to face. There would be almost a year of unremitting agony, physical and mental, worse than a Khiftan torture rack. There would be the shame of having his innermost secrets poured out of him by the psychotherapists, and, at the end, there would emerge someone who would not be Salgath Trod, or anybody like Salgath Trod, and he would have to learn to know this stranger, and build a new life for him.</p>
				<p>In one of the viewscreens, he saw the door to the service hallway open. Zinganna, in a black evening gown and a black velvet cloak, and Calilla, the housemaid, in what she believed to be a reasonable facsimile of fashionable First Level dress, and Nindrandigro, in one of his master’s evening suits, emerged. Salgath Trod waited until they had gone down the hall to the antigrav shaft, and then he turned on the visiphone, checked the security, set it for sealed beam communication, and punched out a combination.</p>
				<p>A girl in a green tunic looked out of the screen.</p>
				<p>“Paratime Police,” she said. “Office of Chief Tortha.”</p>
				<p>“I am Executive Councilman Salgath Trod,” he told her. “I am, and for the past fifteen years have been, criminally involved with the organization responsible for the slave trade which recently came to light on Third Level Esaron. I give myself up unconditionally; I am willing to make full confession under narco-hypnosis, and will accept whatever disposition of my case is lawfully judged fit. You’ll have to send an escort for me; I might start from my apartment alone, but I’d be killed before I got to your headquarters⁠—”</p>
				<p>The girl, who had begun to listen in the bored manner of public servants phone girls, was staring wide-eyed.</p>
				<p>“Just a moment, Councilman Salgath; I’ll put you through to Chief Tortha.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The dinner lacked a half hour of being served; Thalvan Dras’ guests loitered about the drawing room, sampling appetizers and chilled drinks and chatting in groups. It wasn’t the artistic crowd usual at Thalvan Dras’ dinners; most of the guests seemed to be business or political people. Thalvan Dras had gotten Vall and Dalla into the small group around him, along with pudgy, infantile-faced Brogoth Zaln, his confidential secretary, and Javrath Brend, his financial attorney.</p>
				<p>“I don’t see why they’re making such a fuss about it,” one of the Banking Cartel people was saying. “Causing a lot of public excitement all out of proportion to the importance of the affair. After all, those people were slaves on their own timeline, and if anything, they’re much better off on the Esaron Sector than they would be as captives of the Croutha. As far as that goes, what’s the difference between that and the way we drag these Fourth Level Primitive Sector-Complex people off to Fifth Level Service Sector to work for us?”</p>
				<p>“Oh, there’s a big difference, Farn,” Javrath Brend said. “We recruit those Fourth Level Primitives out of probability worlds of Stone Age savagery, and transpose them to our own Fifth Level timelines, practically outtime extensions of the Home Timeline. There’s absolutely no question of the Paratime Secret being compromised.”</p>
				<p>“Beside, we need a certain amount of human labor, for tasks requiring original thought and decision that are beyond the ability of robots, and most of it is work our Citizens simply wouldn’t perform,” Thalvan Dras added.</p>
				<p>“Well, from a moral standpoint, wouldn’t these Esaron Sector people who buy the slaves justify slavery in the same terms?” a woman whom Vall had identified as a Left Moderate Council Member asked.</p>
				<p>“There’s still a big difference,” Dalla told her. “The ServSec Proles aren’t beaten or tortured or chained; we don’t break up families or separate friends. When we recruit Fourth Level Primitives, we take whole tribes, and they come willingly. And⁠—”</p>
				<p>One of Thalvan Dras’ black-liveried human servants, of the class under discussion, approached Vall.</p>
				<p>“A visiphone call for your lordship,” he whispered. “Chief Tortha Karf calling. If your lordship will come this way⁠—”</p>
				<p>In a screen-booth outside, Vall found Tortha Karf looking out of the screen; he was seated at his desk, fiddling with a gold multicolor pen.</p>
				<p>“Oh, Vall; something interesting has just come up.” He spoke in a voice of forced calmness. “I can’t go into it now, but you’ll want to hear about it. I’m sending a car for you. Better bring Dalla along; she’ll want in on it, too.”</p>
				<p>“Right; we’ll be on the top southwest landing stage in a few minutes.”</p>
				<p>Dalla was still heatedly repudiating any resemblance between the normal First Level methods of labor-recruitment and the activities of the Wizard Traders; she had just finished the story of the woman whose child had been brained when Vall rejoined the group.</p>
				<p>“Dras, I’m awfully sorry,” he said. “This is the second time in succession that Dalla and I have had to bolt away from here, but policemen are like doctors⁠—always on call, and consequently unreliable guests. While you’re feasting, think commiseratingly of Dalla and me; we’ll probably be having a sandwich and a cup of coffee somewhere.”</p>
				<p>“I’m terribly sorry.” Thalvan Dras replied. “We had all been looking forward⁠—Well! Brogoth, have a car called for Vall and Dalla.”</p>
				<p>“Police car coming for us; it’s probably on the landing stage now,” Vall said. “Well, goodbye, everybody. Coming, Dalla?”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>They had a few minutes to wait, under the marquee, before the green police aircar landed and came rolling across the rain-wet surface of the landing stage. Crossing to it and opening the rear door, he put Dalla in and climbed in after her, slamming the door. It was only then that he saw Tortha Karf hunched down in the rear seat. He motioned them to silence, and did not speak until the car was rising above the building.</p>
				<p>“I wanted to fill you in on this, as soon as possible,” he said. “Your hunch about Salgath Trod was good; just a few minutes before I called you, he called me. He says this slave trade is the work of something he calls the Organization; says he’s been taking orders from them for years. His attack on the Management and motion for a censure-vote were dictated from Organization top echelon. Now he’s convinced that they’re going to force him to make false accusations against the Paratime Police and then kill him before he’s compelled to repeat his charges under narco-hypnosis. So he’s offered to surrender and trade information for protection.”</p>
				<p>“How much does he know?” Vall asked.</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf shook his head. “Not as much as he claims to, I suppose; he wouldn’t want to reduce his own trade-in value. But he’s been involved in this thing for the last fifteen years, and with his political prominence, he’d know quite a lot.”</p>
				<p>“We can protect him from his own gang; can we protect him from psycho-rehabilitation?”</p>
				<p>“No, and he knows it. He’s willing to accept that. He seems to think that death at the hands of his own associates is the only other alternative. Probably right, too.”</p>
				<p>The floodlighted green towers of the Paratime Building were wheeling under them as they circled down.</p>
				<p>“Why would they sacrifice a valuable accomplice like Salgath Trod, in order to make a transparently false accusation against us?” Vall wondered.</p>
				<p>“Ha, that’s our new rookie cop’s idea!” Tortha Karf chuckled, nodding toward Dalla. “We got Zortan Harn to introduce an urgent-business motion to appoint a committee to investigate <abbr>BuPsychHyg</abbr>, this morning. The motion passed, and this is the reaction to it. The Organization’s scared. Just as Dalla predicted, they don’t want us finding out how people with potentially criminal characteristics missed being spotted by psychotesting. Salgath Trod is being sacrificed to block or delay that.”</p>
				<p>Vall nodded as the wheels bumped on the landing stage and the antigrav field went off. That was the sort of thing that happened when you started on a really fruitful line of investigation. They got out and hurried over under the marquee, the car lifting and moving off toward the hangars. This was the real break; no matter how this Organization might be compartmented, a man like Salgath Trod would know a great deal. He would name names, and the bearers of those names, arrested and narco-hypnotized, would name other names, in a perfect chain reaction of confessions and betrayals.</p>
				<p>Another police car had landed just ahead of them, and three men were climbing out; two were in Paratime Police green, and the third, handcuffed, was in Service Sector Proletarian garb. At first, Vall though that Salgath Trod had been brought in disguised as a Prole prisoner, and then he saw that the prisoner was short and stocky, not at all like the slender and elegant politician. The two officers who had brought him in were talking to a lieutenant, Sothran Barth, outside the antigrav shaft kiosk. As Vall and Tortha Karf and Dalla walked over, the car which had brought them lifted out.</p>
				<p>“Something that just came in from Industrial Twenty-four, Chief,” Lieutenant Sothran said in answer to Tortha Karf’s question. “May be for Assistant Verkan’s desk.”</p>
				<p>“He’s a Prole named Yandragno, sir,” one of the policemen said. “Industrial Sector Constabulary grabbed him peddling Martian hellweed cigarettes to the girls in a textile mill at Kangabar Equivalent. Captain Jamzar thinks he may have gotten them from somebody in the Organization.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>A little warning bell began ringing in the back of Verkan Vall’s mind, but at first he could not consciously identify the cause of his suspicions. He looked the two policemen and their prisoner over carefully, but could see nothing visibly wrong with them. Then another car came in for a landing and rolled over under the marquee; the door opened, and a police officer got out, followed by an elegantly dressed civilian whom he recognized at once as Salgath Trod. A second policeman was emerging from the car when Vall suddenly realized what it was that had disturbed him.</p>
				<p>It had been Salgath Trod, himself, less than half an hour ago, who had introduced the term, “the Organization,” to the Paratime Police. At that time, if these people were what they claimed to be, they would have been in transposition from Industrial Twenty-four, on the Fifth Level. Immediately, he reached for his needler. He was clearing it of the holster when things began happening.</p>
				<p>The handcuffs fell from the “prisoner’s” wrists; he jerked a neutron-disruption blaster from under his jacket. Vall, his needler already drawn, rayed the fellow dead before he could aim it, then saw that the two pseudo-policemen had drawn their needlers and were aiming in the direction of Salgath Trod. There were no flashes or reports; only the spot of light that had winked on and off under Vall’s rear sight had told him that his weapon had been activated. He saw it appear again as the sights centered on one of the “policemen.” Then he saw the other imposter’s needler aimed at himself. That was the last thing he expected ever to see, in that life; he tried to shift his own weapon, and time seemed frozen, with his arm barely moving. Then there was a white blur as Dalla’s cloak moved in front of him, and the needler dropped from the fingers of the disguised murderer. Time went back to normal for him; he safetied his own weapon and dropped it, jumping forward.</p>
				<p>He grabbed the fellow in the green uniform by the nose with his left hand, and punched him hard in the pit of the stomach with his right fist. The man’s mouth flew open, and a green capsule, the size and shape of a small bean, flew out. Pushing Dalla aside before she would step on it, he kicked the murderer in the stomach, doubling him over, and chopped him on the base of the skull with the edge of his hand. The pseudo-policeman dropped senseless.</p>
				<p>With a handful of handkerchief-tissue from his pocket, he picked up the disgorged capsule, wrapping it carefully after making sure that it was unbroken. Then he looked around. The other two assassins were dead. Tortha Karf, who had been looking at the man in Proletarian dress whom Vall had killed first, turned, looked in another direction, and then cursed. Vall followed his eyes, and cursed also. One of the two policemen who had gotten out of the aircar was dead, too, and so was the all-important witness, Salgath Trod⁠—as dead as Nebu-hin-Abenoz, a hundred thousand parayears away.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The whole thing had ended within thirty seconds; for about half as long, everybody waited, poised in a sort of action-vacuum, for something else to happen. Dalla had dropped the shoulder-bag with which she had clubbed the prisoner’s needler out of his hand, and caught up the fallen weapon. When she saw that the man was down and motionless, she laid it aside and began picking up the glittering or silken trifles that had spilled from the burst bag. Vall retrieved his own weapon, glanced over it, and holstered it. Sothran Barth, the lieutenant in charge of the landing stage, was bawling orders, and men were coming out of the ready-room and piling into vehicles to pursue the aircar which had brought the assassins.</p>
				<p>“Barth!” Vall called. “Have you a hypodermic and a sleep-drug ampoule? Well, give this boy a shot; he’s only impact-stunned. Be careful of him; he’s important.” He glanced around the landing-stage. “Fact is, he’s all we have to show for this business.”</p>
				<p>Then he stooped to help Dalla gather her things, picking up a few of them⁠—a lighter, a tiny crystal perfume flask, miraculously unbroken, a face-powder box which had sprung open and spilled half its contents. He handed them to her, while Sothran Barth bent over the prisoner and gave him an injection, then went to the body of the other pseudo-policeman, forcing open his mouth. In his cheek, still unbroken, was a second capsule, which he added to the first. Tortha Karf was watching him.</p>
				<p>“Same gang that killed that Carera slaver on Esaron Sector?” he asked. “Of course, exactly the same general procedure. Let’s have a look at the other one.”</p>
				<p>The man in Proletarian dress must have had his capsule between his molars when he had been killed; it was broken, and there was a brownish discoloration and chemical odor in his mouth.</p>
				<p>“Second time we’ve had a witness killed off under our noses,” Tortha Karf said. “We’re going to have to smarten up in a hurry.”</p>
				<p>“Here’s one of us who doesn’t have to, much,” Vall said, nodding toward Dalla. “She knocked a needler out of one man’s hand, and we took him alive. The Force owes her a new shoulder-bag: she spoiled that one using it for a club.”</p>
				<p>“Best shoulder-bag we can find you, Dalla,” Tortha Karf promised. “You’re promoted, herewith, to Special Chief’s Assistant’s Special Assistant⁠—You know, this Organization murder-section is good; they could kill anybody. It won’t be long before they assign a squad to us. Blast it, I don’t want to have to go around bodyguarded like a Fourth Level dictator, but⁠—”</p>
				<p>A detective came out of the control room and approached.</p>
				<p>“Screen call for you, sir,” he told Tortha Karf. “One of the news services wants a comment on a story they’ve just picked up that we’ve illegally arrested Councilman Salgath and are holding him incommunicado and searching his apartment.”</p>
				<p>“That’s the Organization,” Vall said. “They don’t know how their boys made out; they’re hoping we’ll tell them.”</p>
				<p>“No comment,” Tortha Karf said. “Call the girl on my switchboard and tell her to answer any other news-service calls. We have nothing to say at this time, but there will be a public statement at⁠ ⁠… at 2330,” he decided after a glance at his watch. “That’ll give us time to agree on a publicity line to adopt. Lieutenant Sothran! Take charge up here. Get all these bodies out of sight somewhere, including those of Councilman Salgath and Detective Malthor. Don’t let anybody talk about this; put a blackout on the whole story. Vall, you and Dalla and⁠ ⁠… oh, you, over there; take the prisoner down to my office. Sothran, any reports from any of the cars that were chasing that fake police car?”</p>
				<p>Verkan Vall and Dalla were sitting behind Tortha Karf’s desk; Vall was issuing orders over the intercom and talking to the detectives who had remained at Salgath Trod’s apartment by visiscreen; Dalla was sorting over the things she had spilled when her bag had burst. They both looked up as Tortha Karf came in and joined them.</p>
				<p>“The prisoner’s still under the drug,” the Chief said. “He’ll be out for a couple of hours; the psych-techs want to let him come out of it naturally and sleep naturally for a while before they give him a hypno. He’s not a ServSec Prole; uncircumcised, never had any syntho-enzyme shots or immunizations, and none of the longevity operations or grafts. Same thing for the two stiffs. And no identity records on any of the three.”</p>
				<p>“The men at Salgath’s apartment say that his housekeeper and his two servants checked out through the house conveyer for ServSec One-Six-Five, at about 1830,” Vall said. “There’s a Prole entertainment center on that timeline. I suppose Salgath gave them the evening off before he called you.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf nodded. “I suppose you ordered them picked up. The news services are going wild about this. I had to make a preliminary statement, to the effect that Salgath Trod was not arrested, came to Headquarters of his own volition, and is under no restraint whatever.”</p>
				<p>“Except, of course, a slight case of rigor mortis,” Dalla added. “Did you mention that, Chief?”</p>
				<p>“No, I didn’t.” Tortha Karf looked as though he had quinine in his mouth. “Vall, how in blazes are we going to handle this?”</p>
				<p>“We ought to keep Salgath’s death hushed up, as long as we can,” Vall said. “The Organization doesn’t know positively what happened here; that’s why they’re handing out tips to the news services. Let’s try to make them believe he’s still alive and talking.”</p>
				<p>“How can we do it?”</p>
				<p>“There ought to be somebody on the Force close enough to Salgath Trod’s anthropometric specifications that our cosmeticians could work him over into a passable impersonation. Our story is that Salgath is on PolTerm, undergoing narco-hypnosis. We will produce an audiovisual of him as soon as he is out of narco-hyp. That will give us time to fix up an impersonator; We’ll need a lot of sound-recordings of Salgath Trod’s voice, of course⁠—”</p>
				<p>“I’ll take care of the Home Timeline end of it; as soon as we get you an impersonator, you go to work with him. Now, let’s see whom we can depend on to help us with this. Lovranth Rolk, of course; Home Timeline section of the Paratime Code Enforcement Division. And⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Verkan Vall and Dalla and Tortha Karf and four or five others looked across the desk and to the end of the room as the telecast screen broke into a shifting light-pattern and then cleared. The face of the announcer appeared; a young woman.</p>
				<p>“And now, we bring you the statement which Chief Tortha of the Paratime Police has promised for this time. This portion of the program was audiovisually recorded at Paratime Police Headquarters earlier this evening.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf’s face appeared on the screen. His voice began an announcement of how Executive Councilman Salgath Trod had called him by visiphone, admitting to complicity in the recently-discovered paratemporal slave-trade.</p>
				<p>“Here is a recording of Councilman Salgath’s call to me from his apartment to my office at 1945 this evening.”</p>
				<p>The screen-image shattered into light-shards and rebuilt itself: Salgath Trod, at his desk in the library of his apartment, the brandy-goblet and the needler within reach, appeared. He began to speak: from time to time the voice of Tortha Karf interrupted, questioning or prompting him.</p>
				<p>“You understand that this confession renders you liable to psycho-rehabilitation?” Tortha Karf asked.</p>
				<p>Yes, Councilman Salgath understood that.</p>
				<p>“And you agree to come voluntarily to Paratime Police Headquarters, and you will voluntarily undergo narco-hypnotic interrogation?”</p>
				<p>Yes, Salgath Trod agreed to that.</p>
				<p>“I am now terminating the playback of Councilman Salgath’s call to me,” Tortha Karf said, reappearing on the screen. “At this point Councilman Salgath began making a statement about his criminal activities, which we have on record. Because he named a number of his criminal associates, whom we have no intention of warning, this portion of Councilman Salgath’s call cannot at this time be made public. We have no intention of having any of these suspects escape, or of giving their associates an opportunity to murder them to prevent their furnishing us with additional information. Incidentally, there was an attempt, made on the landing stage of Paratime Police Headquarters, to murder Councilman Salgath, when he was brought here guarded by Paratime Police officers⁠—”</p>
				<p>He went on to give a colorful and, as far as possible, truthful, account of the attack by the two pseudo-policemen and their pseudo-prisoner. As he told it, however, all three had been killed before they could accomplish their purpose, one of them by Salgath Trod himself.</p>
				<p>The image of Tortha Karf was replaced by a view of the three assassins lying on the landing stage. They all looked dead, even the one who wasn’t; there was nothing to indicate that he was merely drugged. Then, one after another, their faces were shown in closeup, while Tortha Karf asked for close attention and memorization.</p>
				<p>“We believe that these men were Fifth Level Proles; we think that they were under hypnotic influence or obeying posthypnotic commands when they made their suicidal attack. If any of you have ever seen any of these men before, it is your duty to inform the Paratime Police.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>That ended it. Tortha Karf pressed a button in front of him and the screen went dark. The spectators relaxed.</p>
				<p>“Well! Nothing like being sincere with the public, is there?” Della commented. “I’ll remember this the next time I tune in a Management public statement.”</p>
				<p>“In about five minutes,” one of the bureau-chiefs, said, “all hell is going to break loose. I think the whole thing is crazy!”</p>
				<p>“I hope you have somebody who can give a convincing impersonation,” Lovranth Rolk said.</p>
				<p>“Yes. A field agent named Kostran Galth,” Tortha Karf said. “We ran the personal description cards for the whole Force through the machine; Kostran checked to within one-twentieth of one percent; he’s on Police Terminal, now, coming by rocket from Ravvanan Equivalent. We ought to have the whole thing ready for telecast by 1730 tomorrow.”</p>
				<p>“He can’t learn to imitate Salgath’s voice convincingly in that time, with all the work the cosmeticians’ll have to be doing on him,” Dalla said.</p>
				<p>“Make up a tape of Salgath’s own voice, out of that pile of recordings we got at his apartment, and what we can get out of the news file.” Vall said. “We have phoneticists who can split syllables and splice them together. Kostran will deliver his speech in dumb-show, and we’ll dub the sound in and telecast them as one. I’ve messaged PolTerm to get to work on that; they can start as soon as we have the speech written.”</p>
				<p>“The more it succeeds now, the worse the blowup will be when we finally have to admit that Salgath was killed here tonight,” the Chief Inter-officer Coordinator, Zostha Olv said. “We’d better have something to show the public to justify that.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, we had,” Tortha Karf agreed. “Vall, how about the Kholghoor Sector operation. How far’s Ranthar Jard gotten toward locating one of those Wizard Trader timelines?”</p>
				<p>“Not very far,” Vall admitted. “He has it pinned down to the sub-sector, but the belt seems to be one we haven’t any information at all for. Never been any legitimate penetration by paratimers. He has his own hagiologists, and a couple borrowed from Outtime Religious Institute; they’ve gotten everything the slaves can give them on that. About the only thing to do is start random observation with boomerang-balls.”</p>
				<p>“Over about a hundred thousand timelines,” Zostha Olv scoffed. He was an old man, even for his long-lived race; he had a thin nose and a narrow, bitter, mouth. “And what will he look for?”</p>
				<p>“Croutha with guns.” Tortha Karf told him, then turned to Vall. “Can’t he narrow it more than that? What have his experts been getting out of those slaves?”</p>
				<p>“That I don’t know, to date.” Vall looked at the clock. “I’ll find out, though; I’ll transpose to Police Terminal and call him up. And Skordran Kirv. No. Vulthor Tharn; it’d hurt the old fellow’s feelings if I bypassed him and went to one of his subordinates. Half an hour each way, and at most another hour talking to Ranthar and Vulthor; there won’t be anything doing here for two hours.” He rose. “See you when I get back.”</p>
				<p>Dalla had turned on the telescreen again; after tuning out a dance orchestra and a comedy show, she got the image of an angry-faced man in evening clothes.</p>
				<p>“… And I’m going to demand a full investigation, as soon as Council convenes tomorrow morning!” he was shouting. “This whole story is a preposterous insult to the integrity of the entire Executive Council, your elected representatives, and it shows the criminal lengths to which this would-be dictator, Tortha Karf, and his jackal Verkan Vall will go⁠—”</p>
				<p>“So long, jackal.” Dalla called to him as he went out.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>He spent the half-hour transposition to Police Terminal sleeping. Paratime-transpositions and rocket-flights seemed to be his only chance to get any sleep. He was still sleepy when he sat down in front of the radio telescreen behind his duplicate of Tortha Karf’s desk and put through a call to Nharkan Equivalent. It was 0600 in India; the Sector Regional Deputy Subchief who was holding down Ranthar Jard’s desk looked equally sleepy; he had a mug of coffee in front of him, and a brown-paper cigarette in his mouth.</p>
				<p>“Oh, hello, Assistant Verkan. Want me to call Subchief Ranthar?”</p>
				<p>“Is he sleeping? Then for mercy’s sake don’t. What’s the present status of the investigation?”</p>
				<p>“Well, we were dropping boomerang balls yesterday, while we had sun to mask the return-flashes. Nothing. The Croutha have taken the city of Sohram, just below the big bend of the river. Tomorrow, when we have sunlight, we’re going to start boomerang-balling the central square. We may get something.”</p>
				<p>“The Wizard Traders’ll be moving in near there, about now,” Vall said. “The Croutha ought to have plenty of merchandise for them. Have you gotten anything more done on narrowing down the possible area?”</p>
				<p>The deputy bit back a yawn and reached for his coffee mug.</p>
				<p>“The experts have just about pumped these slaves empty,” he said. “The local religion is a mess. Seems to have started out as a Great Mother cult; then it picked up a lot of gods borrowed from other peoples; then it turned into a dualistic monotheism; then it picked up a lot of minor gods and devils⁠—new devils usually gods of the older pantheon. And we got a lot of gossip about the feudal wars and faction-fights among the nobility, and so on, all garbled, because these people are peasants who only knew what went on on the estate of their own lord.”</p>
				<p>“What did go on there?” Vall asked. “Ask them about recent improvements, new buildings, new fields cleared, new paddies flooded, that sort of thing. And pick out a few of the highest <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.Q.</abbr>’s from both timelines, and have them locate this estate on a large-scale map, and draw plans showing the location of buildings, fields and other visible features. If you have to, teach them mapping and sketching by hypno-mech. And then drop about five hundred to a thousand boomerang balls, at regular intervals, over the whole paratemporal area. When you locate a timeline that gives you a picture to correspond to their description, boomerang the main square in Sohram over the whole belt around it, to find Croutha with firearms.”</p>
				<p>The deputy looked at him for a moment then gulped more coffee.</p>
				<p>“Can do, Assistant Verkan. I think I’ll send somebody to wake up Subchief Ranthar, right now. Want to talk to him.”</p>
				<p>“Won’t be necessary. You’re recording this call, of course? Then play it back to him. And get cracking with the slaves; you want enough information out of them to enable you to start boomerang balling as soon as the sun’s high enough.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>He broke off the connection and sent out for coffee for himself. Then he put through a call to Novilan Equivalent, in western North America.</p>
				<p>It was 1530, there, when he got Vulthor Tharn on the screen.</p>
				<p>“Good afternoon. Assistant Verkan. I suppose you’re calling about the slave business. I’ve turned the entire matter over to Field Agent Skordran; gave him a temporary rank of Deputy Subchief. That’s subject to your approval and Chief Tortha’s, of course⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Make the appointment permanent,” Vall said. “I’ll have a confirmation along from Chief Tortha directly. And let me talk to him now, if you please. Subchief Vulthor.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, sir. Switching you over now.” The screen went into a beautiful burst of abstract art, and cleared, after a while, with Skordran Kirv looking out of it.</p>
				<p>“Hello, Deputy Skordran, and congratulations. What’s come up since we had Nebu-hin-Abenoz cut out from under us?”</p>
				<p>“We went in on that timeline, that same night, with an airboat and made a recon in the hills back of Careba. Scared the fear of Safar into a party of Caleras while we were working at low altitude, by the way. We found the conveyer-head site: hundred-foot circle with all the grass and loose dirt transposed off it and a pole pen, very unsanitary where about two-three hundred slaves would be kept at a time. No indications of use in the last ten days. We did some pretty thorough boomeranging on that spatial equivalent over a couple of thousand timelines and found thirty more of them. I believe the slavers have closed out the whole Esaron Sector operation, at least temporarily.”</p>
				<p>That was what he’d been afraid of; he hoped they wouldn’t do the same thing on the Kholghoor Sector.</p>
				<p>“Let me have the designations of the timelines on which you found conveyer heads,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Just a moment, Chief’s Assistant; I’ll photoprint them to you. Set for reception?”</p>
				<p>Vall opened a slide under the screen and saw that the photoprint film was in place, then closed it again, nodding. Skordran Kirv fed a sheet of paper into his screen cabinet and his arm moved forward out of the picture.</p>
				<p>“On, sir,” he said. He and Vall counted ten seconds together, and then Skordran Kirv said: “Through to you.” Vall pressed a lever under his screen, and a rectangle of microcopy print popped out.</p>
				<p>“That’s about all I have, sir. Want me to keep my troops ready here, or shall I send them somewhere else?”</p>
				<p>“Keep them ready, Kirv,” Vall told him. “You may need them before long. Call you later.”</p>
				<p>He put the microcopy in an enlarger, and carried the enlarged print with him to the conveyer room. There was something odd about the list of timeline designations. They were expressed numerically, in First Level notation; extremely short groups of symbols capable of exact expression of almost inconceivably enormous numbers. Vall had only a general-education smattering of mathematics⁠—enough to qualify him for the chair of Higher Mathematics at any university on, say, the Fourth Level Europo-American Sector⁠—and he could not identify the peculiarity, but he could recognize that there existed some sort of pattern. Shoving in the starting lever, he relaxed in one of the chairs, waiting for the transposition field to build up around him, and fell asleep before the mesh dome of the conveyer had vanished. He woke, the list of timeline designations in his hand, when the conveyor rematerialized on Home Timeline. Putting it in his pocket, he hurried to an antigrav shaft and floated up to the floor on which Tortha Karf’s office was.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Tortha Karf was asleep in his chair; Dalla was eating a dinner that had been brought in to her⁠—something better than the sandwich and mug of coffee Vall had mentioned to Thalvan Dras. Several of the bureau chiefs who had been there when he had gone out had left, and the psychist who had taken charge of the prisoner was there.</p>
				<p>“I think he’s coming out of the drug, now,” he reported. “Still asleep, though. We want him to waken naturally before we start on him. They’ll call me as soon as he shows signs of stirring.”</p>
				<p>“The Opposition’s claiming, now, that we drugged and hypnotized Salgath into making that visiscreen confession,” Dalla said. “Can you think of any way you could do that without making the subject incapable of lying?”</p>
				<p>“Pseudo-memories,” the psychist said. “It would take about three times as long as the time between Salgath Trod’s departure from his apartment and the time of the telecast, though⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You know much higher math?” Vall asked the psychist.</p>
				<p>“Well, enough to handle my job. Neuron-synapse interrelations, memory-and-association patterns, that kind of thing, all have to be expressed mathematically.”</p>
				<p>Vall nodded and handed him the timeline designation list.</p>
				<p>“See any kind of a pattern there?” he asked.</p>
				<p>The psychist looked at the paper and blanked his face as he drew on hypnotically-acquired information.</p>
				<p>“Yes. I’d say that all the numbers are related in some kind of a series to some other number. Simplified down to kindergarten level, say the difference between A and B is, maybe, one-decillionth of the difference between X and A, and the difference between B and C is one-decillionth of the difference between X and B, and so on⁠—”</p>
				<p>A voice came out of one of the communication boxes:</p>
				<p>“<abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Nentrov; the patient’s out of the drug, and he’s beginning to stir about.”</p>
				<p>“That’s it,” the psychist said. “I have to run.” He handed the sheet back to Vall, took a last drink from his coffee cup, and bolted out of the room.</p>
				<p>Dalla picked up the sheet of paper and looked at it. Vall told her what it was.</p>
				<p>“If those timelines are in regular series, they relate to the base line of operations,” she said. “Maybe you can have that worked out. I can see how it would be; a stated interval between the Esaron Sector lines, to simplify transposition control settings.”</p>
				<p>“That was what I was thinking. It’s not quite as simple as <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Nentrov expressed it, but that could be the general idea. We might be able to work out the location of the base line from that. There seems to be a break in the number sequence in here; that would be the timeline Skordran Kirv found those slaves on.” He reached for the pipe he had left on the desk when he had gone to Police Terminal and began filling it.</p>
				<p>A little later, a buzzer sounded and a light came on on one of the communication boxes. He flipped the switch and said, “Verkan Vall here.” Sothran Barth’s voice came cut of the box.</p>
				<p>“They’ve just brought in Salgath Trod’s servants. Picked them up as they came out of the house conveyer at the apartment building. I don’t believe they know what’s happened.”</p>
				<p>Vall flipped a switch and twiddled a dial; a viewscreen lit up, showing the landing stage. The police car had just landed: one detective had gotten out, and was helping the girl, Zinganna, who had been Salgath Trod’s housekeeper and mistress, to descend. She was really beautiful. Vall thought: rather tall, slender, with dark eyes and a creamy light-brown skin. She wore a black cloak, and, under it, a black and silver evening gown. A single jewel twinkled in her black hair. She could have very easily passed for a woman of his own race.</p>
				<p>The housemaid and the butler were a couple of entirely different articles. Both were about four or five generations from Fourth Level Primitive savagery. The maid, in garishly cheap finery, was big-boned and heavy-bodied, with red-brown hair; she looked like a member of one of the northern European reindeer-herding peoples who had barely managed to progress as far as the bow and arrow. The butler was probably a mixture of half a dozen primitive races; he was wearing one of his late master’s evening suits, a bright mellow-pink, which was distinctly unflattering to his complexion.</p>
				<p>The sound-pickup was too far away to give him what they were saying, but the butler and maid were waving their arms and protesting vehemently. One of the detectives took the woman by the arm; she jerked it loose and aimed a backhand slap at him. He blocked it on his forearm. Immediately, the girl in black turned and said something to her, and she subsided. Vall said, into the box:</p>
				<p>“Barth, have the girl in the black cloak brought down to Number Four Interview Room. Put the other two in separate detention cubicles; we’ll talk to them later.” He broke the connection and got to his feet. “Come on, Dalla. I want you to help me with the girl.”</p>
				<p>“Just try and stop me,” Dalla told him. “Any interviews you have with that little item, I want to sit in on.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The Proletarian girl, still guarded by a detective, had already been placed in the interview room. The detective nodded to Vall, tried to suppress a grin when he saw Dalla behind him, and went out. Vall saw his wife and the prisoner seated, and produced his cigarette case, handing it around.</p>
				<p>“You’re Zinganna; you’re of the household of Councilman Salgath Trod, aren’t you?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Housekeeper and hostess,” the girl replied. “I am also his mistress.”</p>
				<p>Vall nodded, smiling. “Which confirms my long-standing respect for Councilman Salgath’s exquisite taste.”</p>
				<p>“Why, thank you,” she said. “But I doubt if I was brought here to receive compliments. Or was I?”</p>
				<p>“No, I’m afraid not. Have you heard the newscasts of the past few hours concerning Councilman Salgath?”</p>
				<p>She straightened in her seat, looking at him seriously.</p>
				<p>“No. I and Nindrandigro and Calilla spent the evening on ServSec One-Six-Five. Councilman Salgath told me that he had some business and wanted them out of the apartment, and wanted me to keep an eye on them. We didn’t hear any news at all.” She hesitated. “Has anything⁠ ⁠… serious⁠ ⁠… happened?”</p>
				<p>Vall studied her for a moment, then glanced at Dalla. There existed between himself and his wife a sort of vague, semitelepathic, rapport; they had never been able to transmit definite and exact thoughts, but they could clearly prehend one another’s feelings and emotions. He was conscious, now, of Dalla’s sympathy for the Proletarian girl.</p>
				<p>“Zinganna, I’m going to tell you something that is being kept from the public,” he said. “By doing so, I will make it necessary for us to detain you, at least for a few days. I hope you will forgive me, but I think you would forgive me less if I didn’t tell you.”</p>
				<p>“Something’s happened to him,” she said, her eyes widening and her body tensing.</p>
				<p>“Yes, Zinganna. At about 2010, this evening,” he said, “Councilman Salgath was murdered.”</p>
				<p>“Oh!” She leaned back in the chair, closing her eyes. “He’s dead?” Then, again, statement instead of question: “He’s dead!”</p>
				<p>For a long moment, she lay back in the chair, as though trying to reorient her mind to the fact of Salgath Trod’s death, while Vall and Dalla sat watching her. Then she stirred, opened her eyes, looked at the cigarette in her fingers as though she had never seen it before, and leaned forward to stuff it into an ash receiver.</p>
				<p>“Who did it?” she asked, the Stone Age savage who had been her ancestor not ten generations ago peeping out of her eyes.</p>
				<p>“The men who actually used the needlers are dead,” Vall told her. “I killed a couple of them myself. We still have to find the men who planned it. I’d hoped you’d want to help us do that, Zinganna.”</p>
				<p>He side-glanced to Dalla again; she nodded. The relationship between Zinganna and Salgath Trod hadn’t been purely business with her; there had been some real affection. He told her what had happened, and when he reached the point at which Salgath Trod had called Tortha Karf to confess complicity in the slave trade, her lips tightened and she nodded.</p>
				<p>“I was afraid it was something like that,” she said. “For the last few days, well, ever since the news about the slave trade got out, he’s been worried about something. I’ve always thought somebody had some kind of a hold over him. Different times in the past, he’s done things so far against his own political best interests that I’ve had to believe he was being forced into them. Well, this time they tried to force him too far. What then?”</p>
				<p>Vall continued the story. “So we’re keeping this hushed up, for a while. The way we’re letting it out, Salgath Trod is still alive, on Police Terminal, talking under narco-hypnosis.”</p>
				<p>She smiled savagely. “And they’ll get frightened, and frightened men do foolish things,” she finished. She hadn’t been a politician’s mistress for nothing. “What can I do to help?”</p>
				<p>“Tell us everything you can,” he said. “Maybe we can be able to take such actions as we would have taken if Salgath Trod had lived to talk to us.”</p>
				<p>“Yes, of course.” She got another cigarette from the case Vall had laid on the table. “I think, though, that you’d better give me a narco-hypnosis. You want to be able to depend on what I’m going to tell you, and I want to be able to remember things exactly.”</p>
				<p>Vall nodded approvingly and turned to Dalla.</p>
				<p>“Can you handle this, yourself?” he asked. “There’s an audiovisual recorder on now; here’s everything you need.” He opened the drawers in the table to show her the narco-hypnotic equipment. “And the phone has a whisper mouthpiece; you can call out without worrying about your message getting into Zinganna’s subconscious. Well, I’ll see you when you’re through; you bring Zinganna to Police Terminal; I’ll probably be there.”</p>
				<p>He went out, closing the door behind him, and went down the hall, meeting the officer who had taken charge of the butler and housemaid.</p>
				<p>“We’re having trouble with them, sir,” he said. “Hostile. Yelling about their rights, and demanding to see a representative of Proletarian Protective League.”</p>
				<p>Vall mentioned the Proletarian Protective League with unflattering vulgarity.</p>
				<p>“If they don’t cooperate, drag them out and inject them and question them anyhow,” he said.</p>
				<p>The detective-lieutenant looked worried. “We’ve been taking a pretty high hand with them as it is,” he protested. “It’s safer to kill a Citizen than bloody a Prole’s nose; they have all sorts of laws to protect them.”</p>
				<p>“There are all sorts of laws to protect the Paratime Secret,” Vall replied. “And I think there are one or two laws against murdering members of the Executive Council. In case <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.P.L.</abbr> makes any trouble, they aren’t here; they have faithfully joined their beloved master in his refuge on PolTerm. But one or both of them work for the Organization.”</p>
				<p>“You’re sure of that?”</p>
				<p>“The Organization is too thorough not to have had a spy in Salgath’s household. It wasn’t Zinganna, because she’s volunteered to talk to us under narco-hyp. So who does that leave?”</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s different; that makes them suspects.” The lieutenant seemed relieved. “We’ll pump that pair out right away.”</p>
				<p>When he got back to Tortha Karf’s office, the Chief was awake, and doodling on his notepad with his multicolor pen. Vall looked at the pad and winced; the Chief was doodling bugs again⁠—red ants with black legs, and blue-and-green beetles. Then he saw that the psychist, Nentrov Dard, was drinking straight 150-proof palm-rum.</p>
				<p>“Well, tell me the worst,” he said.</p>
				<p>“Our boy’s memory-obliterated,” Nentrov Dard said, draining his glass and filling it again. “And he’s plastered with pseudo-memories a foot thick. It’ll be five or six ten-days before we can get all that stuff peeled off and get him unblocked. I put him to sleep and had him transposed to Police Terminal. I’m going there, myself, tomorrow morning, after I’ve had some sleep, and get to work on him. If you’re hoping to get anything useful out of him in time to head off this Council crisis that’s building up, just forget it.”</p>
				<p>“And that leaves us right back with our old friends, the Wizard Traders,” Tortha Karf added. “And if they’ve decided to suspend activities on the Kholghoor Sector, too⁠—” He began drawing a big blue and black spider in the middle of the pad.</p>
				<p>Nentrov Dard crushed out his cigar, drank his rum, and got to his feet.</p>
				<p>“Well, good night, Chief; Vall. If you decide to wake me up before 1000, send somebody you want to get rid of in a hurry.” He walked around the deck and out the side door.</p>
				<p>“I hope they don’t,” Vall said to Tortha Karf. “Really, though, I doubt if they do. This is their chance to pick up a lot of slaves cheaply; the Croutha are too busy to bother haggling. I’m going through to PolTerm, now; when Dalla and Zinganna get through, tell them to join me there.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>On Police Terminal, he found Kostran Galth, the agent who had been selected to impersonate Salgath Trod. After calling Zulthran Torv, the mathematician in charge of the Computer Office and giving him the Esaron timeline designations and Nentrov Dard’s ideas about them, he spent about an hour briefing Kostran Galth on the role he was to play. Finally, he undressed and went to bed on a couch in the rest room behind the office.</p>
				<p>It was noon when he woke. After showering, shaving and dressing hastily, he went out to the desk for breakfast, which arrived while he was putting a call through to Ranthar Jard, at Nharkan Equivalent.</p>
				<p>“Your idea paid off, Chief’s Assistant,” the Kholghoor SecReg Subchief told him. “The slaves gave us a lot of physical description data on the estate, and told us about new fields that had been cleared, and a dam this Lord Ghromdour was building to flood some new rice-paddies. We located a belt of about five parayears where these improvements had been made: we started boomeranging the whole belt, timeline by timeline. So far, we have ten or fifteen pictures of the main square at Sohram showing Croutha with firearms, and pictures of Wizard Trader camps and conveyer heads on the same timelines. Here, let me show you; this is from an airboat over the forest outside the equivalent of Sohram.”</p>
				<p>There was no jungle visible when the view changed; nothing but clusters of steel towers and platforms and buildings that marked conveyer heads, and a large rectangle of red-and-white antigrav-buoys moored to warn air traffic out of the area being boomeranged. The pickup seemed to be pointed downward from the bow of an airboat circling at about ten thousand feet.</p>
				<p>“Balls ready to go,” a voice called, and then repeated a string of timeline designations. “Estimated return, 1820, give or take four minutes.”</p>
				<p>“Varth,” Ranthar Jard said, evidently out of the boat’s radio. “Your telecast is being beamed on Dhergabar Equivalent; Chief’s Assistant Verkan is watching. When do you estimate your next return?”</p>
				<p>“Any moment, now, sir; we’re holding this drop till they rematerialize.”</p>
				<p>Vall watched unblinkingly, his fork poised halfway to his mouth. Suddenly, about a thousand feet below the eye of the pickup, there was a series of blue flashes, and, an instant later, a blossoming of red-and-white parachutes, ejected from the photo-reconnaissance balls that had returned from the Kholghoor Sector.</p>
				<p>“All right; drop away,” the boat captain called. There was a gush, from underneath, of eight-inch spheres, their conductor-mesh twinkling golden-bright in the sunlight. They dropped in a tight cluster for a thousand or so feet and then flashed and vanished. From the ground, six or eight aircars rose to meet the descending parachutes and catch them.</p>
				<p>The screen went cubist for a moment, and then Ranthar Jard’s swarthy, wide-jawed face looked out of it again. He took his pipe from his mouth.</p>
				<p>“We’ll probably get a positive out of the batch you just saw coming in,” he said. “We get one out of about every two drops.”</p>
				<p>“Message a list of the timeline designations you’ve gotten so far to Zulthran Torv, at Computer Office here,” Vall said. “He’s working on the Esaron Sector dope; we think a pattern can be established. I’ll be seeing you in about five hours; I’m rocketing out of here as soon as I get a few more things cleared up here.”</p>
				<p>Zulthran Torv, normally cautious to the degree of pessimism, was jubilant when Vall called him.</p>
				<p>“We have something, Vall,” he said. “It is, roughly, what <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Nentrov suggested⁠—each of the intervals between the designations is a very minute but very exact fraction of the difference between lesser designation and the baseline designation.”</p>
				<p>“You have the baseline designation?” Vall demanded.</p>
				<p>“Oh, yes. That’s what I was telling you. We worked that out from the designations you gave me.” He recited it. “All the designations you gave me are⁠—”</p>
				<p>Vall wasn’t listening to him. He frowned in puzzlement.</p>
				<p>“That’s not a Fifth Level designation,” he said. “That’s First Level!”</p>
				<p>“That’s correct. First Level Abzar Sector.”</p>
				<p>“Now why in blazes didn’t anybody think of that before?” he marveled, and as he did, he knew the answer. Nobody ever thought of the Abzar sector.</p>
				<p>Twelve millennia ago, the world of the First Level had been exhausted; having used up the resources of their home planet, Mars, a hundred thousand years before, the descendants of the population that had migrated across space had repeated on the third planet the devastation of the fourth. The ancestors of Verkan Vall’s people had discovered the principle of paratime transposition and had begun to exploit an infinity of worlds on other lines of probability. The people of the First Level Dwarma Sector, reduced by sheer starvation to a tiny handful, had abandoned their cities and renounced their technologies and created for themselves a farm-and-village culture without progress or change or curiosity or struggle or ambition, and a way of life in which every day was like every other day that had been or that would come.</p>
				<p>The Abzar people had done neither. They had wasted their resources to the last, fighting bitterly over the ultimate crumbs, with fission bombs, and with muskets, and with swords, and with spears and clubs, and finally they had died out, leaving a planet of almost uniform desert dotted with vast empty cities which even twelve thousand years had hardly begun to obliterate.</p>
				<p>So nobody on the Paratime Sector went to the Abzar Sector. There was nothing there⁠—except a hiding-place.</p>
				<p>“Well, message that to Subchief Ranthar Jard, Kholghoor Sector at Nharkan Equivalent, and to Subchief Vulthor, Esaron Sector, Novilan Equivalent,” Vall said. “And be sure to mark what you send Vulthor, ‘Immediate attention Deputy Subchief Skordran.’ ”</p>
				<p>That reminded him of something; as soon as he was through with Zulthran, he got out an order in the name of Tortha Karf authorizing Skordran Kirv’s promotion on a permanent basis and messaged it out. Something was going to have to be done with Vulthor Tharn, too. A promotion of course⁠—say Deputy Bureau Chief. Hypno-Mech Tape Library at Dhergabar Home Timeline; there Vulthor’s passion for procedure and his caution would be assets instead of liabilities. He called Vlasthor Arph, the Chief’s Deputy assigned to him as adjutant.</p>
				<p>“I want more troops from ServSec and IndSec,” he said. “Go over the <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">T.O.</abbr>’s and see what can be spared from where; don’t strip any timeline, but get a force of the order of about three divisions. And locate all the big antigrav-equipped ship transposition docks on Commercial and Passenger Sectors, and a list of freighters and passenger ships that can be commandeered in a hurry. We think we’ve spotted the timeline the Organization’s using as a base. As soon as we raid a couple of places near Nharkan and Novilan Equivalents, we’re going to move in for a planetwide cleanup.”</p>
				<p>“I get it, Chief’s Assistant. I do everything I can to get ready for a big move, without letting anything leak out. After you strike the first blow, there won’t be any security problem, and the lid will be off. In the meantime, I make up a general plan, and alert all our own people. Right?”</p>
				<p>“Right. And for your information, the base isn’t Fifth Level; it’s First Level Abzar.” He gave the designation.</p>
				<p>Vlasthor Arph chuckled. “Well, think of that! I’d even forgotten there was an Abzar Sector. Shall I tell the reporters that?”</p>
				<p>“Fangs of Fasif, no!” Vall fairly howled. Then, curiously: “What reporters? How’d they get onto PolTerm?”</p>
				<p>“About fifty or sixty news-service people Chief Tortha sent down here, this morning, with orders to prevent them from filing any stories from here but to let them cover the raids, when they come off. We were instructed to furnish them weapons and audiovisual equipment and vocowriters and anything else they needed, and⁠—”</p>
				<p>Vall grinned. “That was one I’d never thought of,” he admitted. “The old fox is still the old fox. No, tell them nothing; we’ll just take them along and show them. Oh, and where are <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hadron Dalla and that girl of Salgath Trod’s?”</p>
				<p>“They’re sleeping, now. Rest Room Eighteen.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Dalla and Zinganna were asleep on a big mound of silk cushions in one corner, their glossy black heads close together and Zinganna’s brown arm around Dalla’s white shoulder. Their faces were calmly beautiful in repose, and they smiled slightly, as though they were wandering through a happy dream. For a little while, Vall stood looking at them, then he began whistling softly. On the third or fourth bar, Dalla woke and sat up, waking Zinganna, and blinked at him perplexedly.</p>
				<p>“What time is it?” she asked.</p>
				<p>“About 1245,” he told her.</p>
				<p>“Ohhh! We just got to sleep,” she said. “We’re both bushed!”</p>
				<p>“You had a hard time. Feel all right after your narco-hyp, Zinganna?”</p>
				<p>“It wasn’t so bad, and I had a nice sleep. And Dalla.⁠ ⁠… <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Hadron, I mean⁠—”</p>
				<p>“Dalla,” Vall’s wife corrected. “Remember what I told you?”</p>
				<p>“Dalla, then,” Zinganna smiled. “Dalla gave me some hypno-treatment, too. I don’t feel so badly about Trod, any more.”</p>
				<p>“Well, look, Zinganna. We’re going to have a man impersonate Councilman Salgath on a telecast. The cosmeticians are making him over now. Would you find it too painful to meet him, and talk to him?”</p>
				<p>“No, I wouldn’t mind. I can criticize the impersonation; remember, I knew Trod very well. You know, I was his hostess, too. I met many of the people with whom he was associated, and they know me. Would things look more convincing if I appeared on the telecast with your man?”</p>
				<p>“It certainly would; it would be a great help!” he told her enthusiastically. “Maybe you girls ought to get up, now. The telecast isn’t till 1930, but there’s a lot to be done getting ready.”</p>
				<p>Dalla yawned. “What I get, trying to be a cop,” she said, then caught the other girl’s hands and rose, pulling her up. “Come on, Zinna; we have to get to work!”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Vall rose from behind the reading-screen in Ranthar Jard’s office, stretching his arms over his head. For almost an hour, he had sat there pushing buttons and twiddling selector and magnification-adjustment knobs, looking at the pictures the Kholghoor-Nharkan cops had taken with auto-return balls dropped over the spatial equivalent of Sohram. One set of pictures, taken at two thousand feet, showed the central square of the city. The effects of the Croutha sack were plainly visible; so were the captives herded together under guard like cattle. By increasing magnification, he looked at groups of the barbarian conquerors, big men with blond or reddish-brown hair, in loose shirts and baggy trousers and rough cowhide buskins. Many of them wore bowl-shaped helmets, some had shirts of ring-mail, all of them carried long straight swords with cross-hilts, and about half of them had pistols thrust through their belts or muskets slung from their shoulders.</p>
				<p>The other set of pictures showed the Wizard Trader camps and conveyer heads. In each case, a wide oval had been burned out in the jungle, probably with heavy-duty heat guns. The camps were surrounded with stout wire-mesh fence: in each there were a number of metal prefab-huts, and an inner fenced slave-pen. A trail had been cut from each to a similarly cleared circle farther back in the forest, and in the centers of one or two of these circles he saw the actual conveyer domes. There was a great deal of activity in all of them, and he screwed the magnification-adjustment to the limit to scrutinize each human figure in turn. A few of the men, he was sure, were First Level Citizens; more were either Proles or outtimers. Quite a few of them were of a dark, heavy-featured, black-bearded type.</p>
				<p>“Some of these fellows look like Second Level Khiftans,” he said. “Rush an individual picture of each one, maximum magnification consistent with clarity, to Dhergabar Equivalent to be transposed to Home Timeline. You get all the dope from Zulthran Torv?”</p>
				<p>“Yes; Abzar Sector,” Ranthar Jard said. “I’d never have thought of that. Wonder why they used that series system, though. I’d have tried to spot my operations as completely at random as possible.”</p>
				<p>“Only thing they could have done,” Vall said. “When we get hold of one of their conveyers, we’re going to find the control panel’s just a mess of arbitrary symbols, and there’ll be something like a computer-machine built into the control cabinet, to select the right timeline whenever a dial’s set or a button pushed, and the only way that could be done would be by establishing some kind of a numerical series. And we were trustingly expecting to locate their base from one of their conveyers! Why, if we give all those people in the pictures narco-hyps, we won’t learn the baseline designation; none of them will know it. They just go where the conveyers take them.”</p>
				<p>“Well, we’re all set now,” Ranthar Jard said. “I have a plan of attack worked out; subject to your approval, I’m ready to start implementing it now.” He glanced at his watch. “The Salgath telecast is over, on Home Timeline, and in a little while, a transcript will be on this timeline. Want to watch it here, sir?”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The telecast screen in the living room of Tortha Karf’s town apartment was still on; in it, a girl with bright red hair danced slowly to soft music against a background of shifting color. The four men who sat in a semicircle facing it sipped their drinks and watched idly.</p>
				<p>“Ought to be getting some sort of public reaction soon,” Tortha Karf said, glancing at his watch.</p>
				<p>“Well, I’ll have to admit, it was done convincingly,” Zostha Olv, the Chief Interoffice Coordinator, admitted grudgingly. “I’d have believed it, if I hadn’t known the real facts.”</p>
				<p>“Shooting it against the background of those wide windows was smart,” Lovranth Rolk said. “Every schoolchild would recognize that view of the rocketport as being on Police Terminal. And including that girl Zinganna; that was a real masterpiece!”</p>
				<p>“I’ve met her, a few times,” Elbraz Vark, the Political Liaison Assistant, said. “Isn’t she lovely!”</p>
				<p>“Good actress, too,” Tortha Karf said. “It’s not easy to impersonate yourself.”</p>
				<p>“Well, Kostran Galth did a fine job of acting, too,” Lovranth Rolk said. “That was done to perfection⁠—the distinguished politician, supported by his loyal mistress, bravely facing the disgraceful end of his public career.”</p>
				<p>“You know, I believe I could get that girl a booking with one of the big theatrical companies. Now that Salgath’s dead, she’ll need somebody to look after her.”</p>
				<p>“What sharp, furry ears you have, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Elbraz!” Zostha Olv grunted.</p>
				<p>The music stopped as though cut off with a knife, and the slim girl with the red hair vanished in a shatter of many colors. When the screen cleared, one of the announcers was looking out of it.</p>
				<p>“We interrupt the program for an important newscast of a sensational development in the Salgath affair,” he said. “Your next speaker will be Yandar Yadd⁠—”</p>
				<p>“I thought you’d managed to get that blabbermouth transposed to PolTerm,” Zostha said.</p>
				<p>“He wouldn’t go.” Tortha Karf replied. “Said it was just a trick to get him off Home Timeline during the Council crisis.”</p>
				<p>Yandar Yadd had appeared on the screen as the pickup swung about.</p>
				<p>“… Recording ostensibly made by Councilman Salgath on Police Terminal Timeline, and telecast on Home Timeline an hour ago. Well, I don’t know who he was, but I now have positive proof that he definitely was not Salgath Trod!”</p>
				<p>“We’re sunk!” Zostha Olv grunted. “He’d never make a statement like that unless he could prove it.”</p>
				<p>“… Something suspicious about the whole thing, from the beginning,” the newsman was saying. “So I checked. If you recall, the actor impersonating Salgath gestured rather freely with his hands, in imitation of a well-known mannerism of the real Salgath Trod; at one point, the ball of his right thumb was presented directly to the pickup. Here’s a still of that scene.”</p>
				<p>He stepped aside, revealing a viewscreen behind him; when he pressed a button, the screen lighted; on it was a stationary picture of Kostran Galth as Salgath Trod, his right hand raised in front of him.</p>
				<p>“Now watch this. I’m going to step up the magnification, slowly, so that you can be sure there’s no substitution. Camera a little closer, Trath!”</p>
				<p>The screen in the background seemed to advance, until it filled the entire screen. Yandar Yadd was still talking, out of the picture; a metal-tipped pointer came into the picture, touching the right thumb, which grew larger and larger until it was the only thing visible.</p>
				<p>“Now here,” Yandar Yadd’s voice continued. “Any of you who are familiar with the ancient science of dactyloscopy will recognize this thumb as having the ridge-pattern known as a ‘twin loop.’ Even with the high degree of magnification possible with the microgrid screen, we can’t bring out the individual ridges, but the pattern is unmistakable. I ask you to memorize that image, while I show you another right thumb print, this time a certified photocopy of the thumb print of the real Salgath Trod.” The magnification was reduced a little, a card was moved into the picture, and it was stepped up again. “See, this thumb print is of the type known as a ‘tented arch.’ Observe the difference.”</p>
				<p>“That does it!” Zostha Olv cried. “Karf, for the first and last time, let me remind you that I opposed this lunacy from the beginning. Now, what are we going to do next?”</p>
				<p>“I suggest that we get to Headquarters as soon as we can,” Tortha Karf said. “If we wait too long, we may not be able to get in.”</p>
				<p>Yandar Yadd was back on the screen, denouncing Tortha Karf passionately. Tortha went over and snapped it off.</p>
				<p>“I suggest we transpose to PolTerm,” Lovranth Rolk said. “It won’t be so easy for them to serve a summons on us there.”</p>
				<p>“You can go to PolTerm if you want to,” Tortha Karf retorted. “I’m going to stay here and fight back, and if they try to serve me with a summons, they’d better send a robot for a process server.”</p>
				<p>“Fight back!” Zostha Olv echoed. “You can’t fight the Council and the whole Management! They’ll tear you into inch bits!”</p>
				<p>“I can hold them off till Vall’s able to raid those Abzar Sector bases,” Tortha Karf said. He thought for a moment. “Maybe this is all for the best, after all. If it distracts the Organization’s attention⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“I wish we could have made a boomerang-ball reconnaissance,” Ranthar Jard was saying, watching one of the viewscreens, in which a film, taken from an airboat transposed to an adjoining Abzar sector timeline, was being shown. The boat had circled over the Ganges, a mere trickle between wide, deeply cut banks, and was crossing a gullied plain, sparsely grown with thornbush. “The base ought to be about there, but we have no idea what sort of changes this gang has made.”</p>
				<p>“Well, we couldn’t: we didn’t dare take the chance of it being spotted. This has to be a complete surprise. It’ll be about like the other place, the one the slaves described. There won’t be any permanent buildings. This operation only started a few months ago, with the Croutha invasion; it may go on for four or five months, till the Croutha have all their surplus captives sold off. That country,” he added, gesturing at the screen, “will be flooded out when the rains come. See how it’s suffered from flood-erosion. There won’t be a thing there that can’t be knocked down and transposed out in a day or so.”</p>
				<p>“I wish you’d let me go along,” Ranthar Jard worried.</p>
				<p>“We can’t do that, either,” Vall said. “Somebody’s got to be in charge here, and you know your own people better than I do. Beside, this won’t be the last operation like this. Next time, I’ll have to stay on Police Terminal and command from a desk; I want firsthand experience with the outtime end of the job, and this is the only way I can get it.”</p>
				<p>He watched the four police-girls who were working at the big terrain board showing the area of the Police Terminal timeline around them. They had covered the miniature buildings and platforms and towers with a fine mesh, at a scale-equivalent of fifty feet; each intersection marked the location of a three-foot conveyer ball, loaded with a sleep-gas bomb and rigged with an automatic detonator which would explode it and release the gas as soon as it rematerialized on the Abzar Sector. Higher, on stiff wires that raised them to what represented three thousand feet, were the disks that stood for ten hundred-foot conveyers; they would carry squads of Paratime Police in aircars and thirty-foot air boats. There was a ring of big two-hundred-foot conveyers a mile out; they would carry the armor and the airborne infantry and the little two-man scooters of the air-cavalry, from the Service and Industrial Sectors. Directly over the spatial equivalent of the Kholghoor Sector Wizard Traders’ conveyers was the single disk of Verkan Vall’s command conveyer, at a represented five thousand feet, and in a half-mile circle around it were the five news service conveyers.</p>
				<p>“Where’s the ship-conveyer?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Actually it’s on antigrav about five miles north of here,” one of the girls said. “Representationally, about where Subchief Ranthar’s standing.”</p>
				<p>Another girl added a few more bits to the network that represented the sleep-gas bombs and stepped back, taking off her earphones.</p>
				<p>“Everything’s in place, now, Assistant Verkan,” she told him.</p>
				<p>“Good. I’m going aboard, now,” he said. “You can have it, Jard.”</p>
				<p>He shook hands with Ranthar Jard, who moved to the switch which would activate all the conveyers simultaneously, and accepted the good wishes of the girls at the terrain board. Then he walked to the mesh-covered dome of the hundred-foot conveyer, with the five news service conveyers surrounding it in as regular a circle as the buildings and towers of the regular conveyer heads would permit. The members of his own detail, smoking and chatting outside, saw him and started moving inside; so did the news people. A public-address speaker began yelping, in a hundred voices all over the area, warning those who were going with the conveyers to get aboard. He went in through a door, between two aircars, and on to the central control-desks, going up to a visiscreen over which somebody had crayoned “Novilan <abbr class="eoc" epub:type="z3998:initialism">E.Q.</abbr>” It gave him a view, over the shoulder of a man in the uniform of a field agent third class, of the interior of a conveyer like his own.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“Hello, Assistant Verkan,” a voice came out of the speaker under the screen, as the man moved his lips. “Deputy Skordran! Here’s Chief’s Assistant Verkan, now!”</p>
				<p>Skordran Kirv moved in front of the screen as the operator got up from his stool.</p>
				<p>“Hello, Vall; we’re all set to move out as soon as you give the word,” he said. “We’re all in position on antigrav.”</p>
				<p>“That’s smart work. We’ve just finished our gas-bomb net,” Vall said. “Going on antigrav now,” he added, as he felt the dome lift. “I hope you won’t be too disappointed if you draw a blank on your end.”</p>
				<p>“We realize that they’ve closed out the whole Esaron Sector,” Skordran Kirv, eight thousand odd miles away, replied. “We’re taking in a couple of ships; we’re going to make a survey all up the coast. There are a lot of other sectors where slaves can be sold in this area.”</p>
				<p>In the outside viewscreen, tuned to a slowly rotating pickup on the top of a tower spatially equivalent with a room in a tall building on Second Level Triplanetary Empire Sector, he could see his own conveyer rising vertically, with the news conveyers following, and the troop conveyers, several miles away, coming into position. Finally, they were all placed; he reported the fact to Skordran Kirv and then picked up a handphone.</p>
				<p>“Everybody ready for transposition?” he called. “On my count. Thirty seconds.⁠ ⁠… Twenty seconds.⁠ ⁠… Fifteen seconds.⁠ ⁠… Five seconds.⁠ ⁠… Four seconds.⁠ ⁠… Three seconds.⁠ ⁠… Two seconds.⁠ ⁠… One second, <em>out</em>!”</p>
				<p>All the screens went gray. The inside of the dome passed into another space-time continuum, even into another kind of space-time. The transposition would take half an hour; that seemed to be the time needed to build up and collapse the transposition field, regardless of the paratemporal distance covered. The dome above and around them vanished; the bare, tower-forested, building-dotted world of Police Terminal vanished, too, into the uniform green of the uninhabited Fifth Level. A planet could take pretty good care of itself, he thought, if people would only leave it alone. Then he began to see the fields and villages of Fourth Level. Cities appeared and vanished, growing higher and vaster as they went across the more civilized Third Level. One was under air attack⁠—there was almost never a paratemporal transposition which did not run through some scene of battle.</p>
				<p>He unbuckled his belt and took off his boots and tunic; all around him, the others were doing the same. Sleep-gas didn’t have to be breathed; it could enter the nervous system by any orifice or lesion, even a pore or a scratch. A spacesuit was the only protection. One of the detectives helped him on with his metal and plastic armor; before sealing his gauntlets, he reciprocated the assistance, then checked the needler and blaster and the long batonlike ultrasonic paralyzer on his belt and made sure that the radio and sound-phones in his helmet were working. He hoped that the frantic efforts to gather several thousand spacesuits onto Police Terminal from the Industrial and Commercial and Interplanetary Sectors hadn’t started rumors which had gotten to the ears of some of the Organization’s ubiquitous agents.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The country below was already turning to the parched browns and yellows of the Abzar Sector. There was not another of the conveyers in sight, but electronic and mechanical lag in the individual controls and even the distance-difference between them and the central radio control would have prevented them from going into transposition at the same fractional microsecond. The recon-details began piling into their cars. Then the red light overhead winked to green, and the dome flickered and solidified into cold, inert metal. The screens lighted up again, and Vall could see Skordran Kirv, across Asia and the Pacific, getting into his helmet. A dot of light in the center of the underview screen widened as the mesh under the conveyer irised open around the pickup.</p>
				<p>Below, the Organization base⁠—big rectangles of fenced slave pens, with metal barracks inside; the huge circle of the Kholghoor Sector conveyer-head building, and a smaller structure that must house conveyers to other Abzar Sector timelines; the workshops and living quarters and hangars and warehouses and docks⁠—was wreathed in white-green mist. The ring of conveyers at three thousand feet were opening and spewing out aircars and airboats, farther away, the greater ring of heavy conveyers were unloading armored and shielded combat-craft. An aircar which must have been above the reach of the gas was streaking away toward the west, with three police cars after it. As he watched, the air around it fairly sizzled blue with the rays of neutron disruption blasters, and then it blew apart. The three police cars turned and came back more slowly. The three-thousand-ton passenger ship which had been hastily fitted with armament was circling about; the great dock conveyer which had brought it was gone, transposed back to Police Terminal to pick up another ship.</p>
				<p>He recorded a message announcing the arrival of the task-force, pulled out the tape and sealed it in a capsule, and put the capsule in a mesh message ball, attaching it to a couple of wires and flipping a switch. The ball flashed and vanished, leaving the wires cleanly sheared off. When it got back to Police Terminal, half an hour later, it would rematerialize, eject a parachute, and turn on a whistle to call attention to itself. Then he sealed on his helmet, climbed into an aircar, and turned on his helmet-radio to speak to the driver. The car lifted a few inches, floated out an open port, and dived downward.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>He landed at the big conveyer-head building. There were spaces for fifty conveyers around it, and all but eight of them were in place. One must have arrived since the gas bombs burst; it was crammed with senseless Kharanda slaves. A couple of Paratime Police officers were towing a tank of sleep-gas around on an antigrav-lifter, maintaining the proper concentration in case any more came in. At the smaller conveyer building, there were no conveyers, only a number of redlined fifty-foot circles around a central two-hundred-foot circle. The Organization personnel there had been dragged outside, and a group of paracops were sealing it up, installing robot watchmen, and preparing to flood it with gas. At the slave pens, a string of two-hundred-foot conveyers, having unloaded soldiers and fighting-gear, were coming in to take on unconscious slaves for transposition to Police Terminal. Aircars and airboats were bringing in gassed slavers; they were being shackled and dumped into the slave barracks; as soon as the gas cleared and they could be brought back to consciousness, they would be narco-hypnotized and questioned.</p>
				<p>He had finished a tour of the warehouses, looking at the kegs of gunpowder and the casks of brandy, the piles of pig lead, the stacks of cases containing muskets. These must have all come from some low-order handcraft timeline. Then there were swords and hatchets and knives that had been made on Industrial Sector⁠—the Organization must be getting them through some legitimate trading company⁠—and mirrors and perfumes and synthetic fiber textiles and cheap jewelry, of similar provenance. It looked as though this stuff had been brought in by ship from somewhere else on this timeline; the warehouses were too far from the conveyers and right beside the ship dock⁠—</p>
				<p>There was a tremendous explosion somewhere. Vall and the men with him ran outside, looking about, the sound-phones of their helmets giving them no idea of the source of the sound. One of the policemen pointed, and Vall’s eyes followed his arm. The ship that had been transposed in in the big conveyer was falling, blown in half; as he looked, both sections hit the ground several miles away. A strange ship, a freighter, was coming in fast, and as he watched, a blue spark winked from her bow as a heavy-duty blaster was activated. There was another explosion, overhead; they all ran for shelter as Vall’s command-conveyer disintegrated into falling scrap-metal. At once, all the other conveyers which were on antigrav began flashing and vanishing. That was the right, the only, thing to do, he knew. But it was leaving him and his men isolated and under attack.</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>“So that was it,” Dalgroth Sorn, the Paratime Commissioner for Security said, relieved when Tortha Karf had finished.</p>
				<p>“Yes, and I’ll repeat it under narco-hyp, too,” Tortha Karf added.</p>
				<p>“Oh, don’t talk that way, Karf,” Dalgroth Sorn scolded. He was at least a century Tortha Karf’s senior; he had the face of an elderly and sore-toothed lion. “You wanted to keep this prisoner under wraps till you could mind-pump him, and you wanted the Organization to think Salgath was alive and talking. I approve both. But⁠—”</p>
				<p>He gestured to the viewscreen across the room, tuned to a pickup back of the Speaker’s chair in the Council Chamber. Tortha Karf turned a knob to bring the sound volume up.</p>
				<p>“Well. I’m raising this point,” a member from the Management seats in the center was saying, “because these earlier charges of illegal arrest and illegal detention are part and parcel with the charges growing out of the telecast last evening.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that telecast was a fake; that’s been established,” somebody on the left heckled.</p>
				<p>“Councilman Salgath’s confession on the evening of One-Six-Two Day wasn’t a fake, the Management supporter, Nanthav Skov, retorted.</p>
				<p>“Well, then why was it necessary to fake the second one?”</p>
				<p>A light began winking on the big panel in front of the Speaker, Asthar Varn.</p>
				<p>“I recognize Councilman Hasthor Flan,” Asthar said.</p>
				<p>“I believe I can construct a theory that will explain that,” Hasthor Flan said. “I suggest that when the Paratime Police were questioning Councilman Salgath under narco-hypnosis, he made statements incriminating either the Paratime Police as a whole or some member of the Paratime Police whom Tortha Karf had to protect⁠—say somebody like Assistant Verkan. So they just killed him, and made up this impostor⁠—”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf began, alphabetically, to blaspheme every god he had ever heard of. He had only gotten as far as a Fourth Level deity named Allah when a red light began flashing in front of Asthar Varn, and the voice of a page-robot, amplified, roared:</p>
				<p>“Point of special urgency! Point of special urgency! It has been requested that the news telecast screen be activated at once, with playback to 1107. An important bulletin has just come in from Nagorabar, Home Timeline, on the Indian subcontinent⁠—”</p>
				<p>“You can stop swearing, now, Karf,” Dalgroth Sorn grinned. “I think this is it.”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Kostran Galth sat on the edge of the couch, with one arm around Zinganna’s waist; on the other side of him, Hadron Dalla lay at full length, her elbows propped and her chin in her hands. The screen in front of them showed a fading sunset, although it was only a little past noon at Dhergabar Equivalent. A dark ship was coming slowly in against the red sky; in the center of a wire-fenced compound a hundred-foot conveyer hung on antigrav twenty feet from the ground, and beyond, a long metal prefab-shed was spilling light from open doors and windows.</p>
				<p>“That crowd that was just taken in won’t be finished for a couple of hours,” a voice was saying. “I don’t know how much they’ll be able to tell; the psychists say they’re all telling about the same stories. What those stories are, of course, I’m not able to repeat. After the trouble caused by a certain news commentator who shall be nameless⁠—he’s not connected with this news service, I’m happy to say⁠—we’re all leaning over backward to keep from breaking Paratime Police security.</p>
				<p>“One thing; shortly after the arrival of the second ship from Police Terminal⁠—and believe me, that ship came in just in the nick of time!⁠—the dead Abzar city which the criminals were using as their main base for this timeline, and from which they launched the air attack against us, was located, and now word has come in that it is entirely in the hands of the Paratime Police. Personally, I doubt if a great deal of information has been gotten from any prisoners taken there. The lengths to which this Organization went to keep their own people in ignorance is simply unbelievable.”</p>
				<p>A man appeared for a moment in the lighted doorway of the shed, then stepped outside.</p>
				<p>“Look!” Dalla cried. “There’s Vall!”</p>
				<p>“There’s Assistant Verkan, now,” the commentator agreed. “Chief’s Assistant, would you mind saying a few words, here? I know you’re a busy man, sir, but you are also the public hero of Home Timeline, and everybody will be glad if you say something to them⁠—”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Tortha Karf sealed the door of the apartment behind them, then activated one of the robot servants and sent it gliding out of the room for drinks. Verkan Vall took off his belt and holster and laid them aside, then dropped into a deep chair with a sigh of relief. Dalla advanced to the middle of the room and stood looking about in surprised delight.</p>
				<p>“Didn’t expect this, from the mess outside?” Vall asked. “You know, you really are on the paracops, now. Nobody off the Force knows about this hideout of the Chief’s.”</p>
				<p>“You’d better find a place like this, too,” Tortha Karf advised. “From now on, you’ll have about as much privacy at that apartment in Turquoise Towers as you’d enjoy on the stage of Dhergabar Opera House.”</p>
				<p>“Just what is my new position?” Vall asked, hunting his cigarette case out of his tunic. “Duplicate Chief of Paratime Police?”</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>The robot came back with three tall glasses and a refrigerated decanter on its top. It stopped in front of Tortha Karf and slewed around on its treads; he filled a glass and sent it to the chair where Dalla had seated herself; when she got a drink, she sent it to Vall. Vall sent if back to Tortha Karf, who turned it off.</p>
				<p>“No; you have the modifier in the wrong place. You’re Chief of Duplicate Paratime Police. You take the setup you have now, and expand it; continue the present lines of investigation, and be ready to exploit anything new that comes up. You won’t bother with any of this routine flying-saucer-scare stuff; just handle the Organization business. That’ll keep you busy for a long time, I’m afraid.”</p>
				<p>“I notice you slammed down on the first Council member who began shouting about how you’d wiped out the Great Paratemporal Crime-Ring,” Vall said.</p>
				<p>“Yes. It isn’t wiped out, and it won’t be wiped out for a long time. I shall be unspeakably delighted if, when I turn my job over to you, you have it wiped out. And even then, there’ll be a loose end to pick up every now and then till you retire.”</p>
				<p>“We have Council and the Management with us, now,” Vall said. “This was the first secret session of Executive Council in over two thousand years. And I thought I’d drop dead when they passed that motion to submit themselves to narco-hypnosis.”</p>
				<p>“A few Councilmen are going to drop dead before they can be narco-hypped,” Dalla prophesied over the rim of her glass.</p>
				<p>“A few have already. I have a list of about a dozen of them who have had fatal accidents or committed suicide, or just died or vanished since the news of your raid broke. Four of them I saw, in the screen, jump up and run out as soon as the news came in, on One-Six-Five Day. And a lot of other people; our friend Yandar Yadd’s dropped out of sight, for one. You heard what we got out of those servants of Salgath Trod’s?”</p>
				<p>“I didn’t,” Dalla said. “What?”</p>
				<p>“Both spies for the Organization. They reported to a woman named Farilla, who ran a fortune-telling parlor in the Prole district. Her occult powers didn’t warn her before we sent a squad of plain-clothes men for her. That was an entirely illegal arrest, by the way, but it netted us a list of about three hundred prominent political, business and social persons whose servants have been reporting to her. She thought she was working for a telecast gossipist.”</p>
				<p>“That’s why we have a new butler, darling,” Vall interrupted. “Kandagro was reporting on us.”</p>
				<p>“Who did she pass the reports on to?” Dalla asked.</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf beamed. “She thinks more like a cop every time I talk to her,” he told Vall. “You better appoint her your Special Assistant. Why, about 1800 every day, some Prole would come in, give the recognition sign, and get the day’s accumulation. We only got one of them, a fourteen-year-old girl. We’re having some trouble getting her deconditioned to a point where she can be hypnotized into talking; by the time we do, they’ll have everything closed out, I suppose. What’s the latest from Abzar Sector? I missed the last report in the rush to get to this Council session.”</p>
				<p>“All stalled. We’re still boomeranging the sector, but it’s about five billion timelines deep, and the pattern for the Kholghoor and Esaron Sectors doesn’t seem to apply. I think they have a lot of these Abzar timelines close together, and they get from one to another via some terminal on Fifth Level.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf nodded. It was impossible to make a transposition of less than ten parayears⁠—a hundred thousand timelines. It was impossible that the field could build and collapse that soon.</p>
				<p>“We also think that this Abzar timeline was only used for the Croutha-Wizard Trader operation. Nothing we found there was more than a couple of months old; nothing since the last rainy season in India, for instance. Everything was cleaned out on Skordran Kirv’s end.”</p>
				<p>“Tell him to try the Mississippi, Missouri and Ohio Valleys,” Tortha Karf said. “A lot of those slaves are sure to have been sold to Second Level Khiftan Sector.”</p>
				<p>“Well, it looks as though our vacation’s out the window for a long time,” Dalla said resignedly.</p>
				<p>“Why don’t you and Vall go to my farm, on Fifth Level Sicily,” Tortha Karf suggested. “I own the whole island, on that timeline, and you can always be reached in a hurry if anything comes up.”</p>
				<p>“We could have as much fun there as on the Dwarma Sector,” Dalla said. “Chief, could we take a couple of friends along?”</p>
				<p>“Well, who?”</p>
				<p>“Zinganna and Kostran Galth,” she replied. “They’ve gotten interested in one another; they’re talking about a tentative marriage.”</p>
				<p>“It’ll have to be mighty tentative,” Vall said. “Kostran Galth can’t marry a Prole.”</p>
				<p>“She won’t be a Prole very long. I’m going to adopt her as my sister.”</p>
				<p>Tortha Karf looked at her sharply. “You sure you know what you’re doing, Dalla?” he asked.</p>
				<p>“Of course I’m sure. I know that girl better than she knows herself. I narco-hypped her, remember. Zinna’s the kind of a sister I’ve always wished I’d had.”</p>
				<p>“Well, that’s all right then. But about this marriage. She was in love with Salgath Trod,” Tortha Karf said. “Now, she’s identifying Agent Kostran with him⁠—”</p>
				<p>“She was in love with the kind of man Salgath could have been if he hadn’t gotten into this Organization filth,” Dalla replied. “Galth is that kind of a man. They’ll get along all right.”</p>
				<p>“Well, she’ll qualify on <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">I.Q.</abbr> and general psych rating for Citizenship. I’ll say that. And she’s the kind of girl I like to see my boys take up with. Like you, Dalla. Yes, of course; take them along with you. Sicily’s big enough that two couples won’t get in each others’ way.”</p>
				<p>A phone-robot, its slender metal stem topped by a metal globe, slid into the room on its ball-rollers, moving falteringly, like a blind man. It could sense Tortha Karf’s electro-encephalic wave-patterns, but it was having trouble locating the source. They all sat motionless, waiting; finally it came over to Tortha Karf’s chair and stopped. He unhooked the phone and held a lengthy whispered conversation with somebody before replacing it.</p>
				<p>“Now, there,” he explained to Dalla. “That’s a sample of why we have to set up this duplicate organization. Revolution just broke out at Ftanna, on Third Level Tsorshay Sector; a lot of our people, mostly tourists and students, are cut off from their conveyers by street fighting. Going to be a pretty bloody business getting them out.” He finished his drink and got to his feet. “Sit still; I just have to make a few screen-calls. Send the robot for something to eat, Vall. I’ll be right back.”</p>
