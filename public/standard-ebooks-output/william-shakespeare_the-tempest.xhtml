									<br/>
									<span>From Milan did supplant good Prospero;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They have bereft; and do pronounce by me</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lingering perdition, worse than any death</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Can be at once, shall step by step attend</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Upon your heads⁠—is nothing but heart-sorrow</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And a clear life ensuing.</span>
