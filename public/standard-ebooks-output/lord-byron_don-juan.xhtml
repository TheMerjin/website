Obedience to nature is the only virtue.” It is possible that Byron traced his own lineaments in this too lifelike portraiture, and at the same time conceived the possibility of a new Don Juan, “made up” after his own likeness.

All that I have ever written on that subject has been done since his decline;⁠—I never ‘met him in the hour of his success.’ I have considered his character at different periods, in its strength and in its weakness: by his zealots I am accused of injustice⁠—by his enemies as his warmest partisan, in many publications, both English and foreign.</p>

During one of these, he read and translated the lines alluding to Bonaparte, in the Third Canto of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Childe Harold</i>.

							<p>Note to the Annexed Stanzas on Brougham</p>
						</header>
						<p>“Distrusted by the Democracy, disliked by the Whigs, and detested by the Tories, too much of a lawyer for the people, and too much of a demagogue for Parliament, a contestor of counties, and a Candidate for cities, the refuse of half the Electors of England, and representative at last upon sufferance of the proprietor of some rotten borough, which it would have been more independent to have purchased, a speaker upon all questions, and the outcast of all parties, his support has become alike formidable to all his enemies (for he has no friends), and his vote can be only valuable when accompanied by his Silence. A disappointed man with a bad temper, he is endowed with considerable but not first-rate abilities, and has blundered on through life, remarkable only for a fluency, in which he has many rivals at the bar and in the Senate, and an eloquence in which he has several Superiors. ‘Willing to wound and <em>not</em> afraid to strike, until he receives a blow in return, he has not yet betrayed any illegal ardour, or Irish alacrity, in accepting the defiances, and resenting the disgraceful terms which his proneness to evil-speaking have (sic) brought upon him. In the cases of Mackinnon and Manners,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1217" id="noteref-1217" epub:type="noteref">1217</a> he sheltered himself behind those parliamentary privileges, which Fox, Pitt, Canning, Castlereagh, Tierney, Adam, Shelburne, Grattan, Corry, Curran, and Clare disdained to adopt as their buckler. The House of Commons became the Asylum of his Slander, as the Churches of Rome were once the Sanctuary of Assassins.</p>
						<p>“His literary reputation (with the exception of one work of his early career) rests upon some anonymous articles imputed to him in a celebrated periodical work; but even these are surpassed by the Essays of others in the same Journal. He has tried everything and succeeded in nothing; and he may perhaps finish as a Lawyer without practice, as he has already been occasionally an orator without an audience, if not soon cut short in his career.</p>
						<p>“The above character is <em>not</em> written impartially, but by one who has had occasion to know some of the baser parts of it, and regards him accordingly with shuddering abhorrence, and just so much fear as he deserves. In him is to be dreaded the crawling of the centipede, not the spring of the tiger⁠—the venom of the reptile, not the strength of the animal⁠—the rancour of the miscreant, not the courage of the Man.</p>
						<p>“In case the prose or verse of the above should be actionable, I put my name, that the man may rather proceed against me than the publisher⁠—not without some faint hope that the brand with which I blast him may induce him, however reluctantly, to a manlier revenge.”</p>

						<p class="continued">but I do not mean them for present publication, because I will not, at this distance, publish <em>that</em> of a Man, for which he has a claim upon another too remote to give him redress.</p>
						<p>“With regard to the Miscreant Brougham, however, it was only long after the fact, and I was made acquainted with the language he had held of me on my leaving England (with regard to the Dss of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">D.</abbr>’s house),<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1218" id="noteref-1218" epub:type="noteref">1218</a> and his letter to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Me.</abbr> de Staël, and various matters for all of which the first time he and I foregather⁠—be it in England, be it on earth⁠—he shall account, and one of the two be carried home.</p>
						<p>“As I have no wish to have mysteries, I merely prohibit the <em>publication</em> of these stanzas in <em>print</em>, for the reasons of fairness mentioned; but I by no means wish <em>him not</em> to <em>know</em> their existence or their tenor, nor my intentions as to himself: he has shown no forbearance, and he shall find none. You may show them to <em>him</em> and to all whom it may concern, with the explanation that the only reason that I have not had satisfaction of this man has been, that I have never had an opportunity since I was aware of the facts, which my friends had carefully concealed from me; and it was only by slow degrees, and by piecemeal, that I got at them. I have not sought him, nor gone out of my way for him; but I will <em>find</em> him, and then we can have it out: he has shown so little courage, that he <em>must</em> fight at last in his absolute necessity to escape utter degradation.</p>
						<p>“I send you the stanzas, which (except the last) have been written nearly two years, merely because I have been lately copying out most of the <abbr>MSS.</abbr> which were in my drawers.”</p>

					<p>Here, and elsewhere in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>, Byron attacked Coleridge fiercely and venomously, because he believed that his protégé had accepted patronage and money, and, notwithstanding, had retailed scandalous statements to the detriment and dishonour of his advocate and benefactor (see letter to Murray, November 24, 1818, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letters</i>, 1900, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 272; and “Introduction to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Vision of Judgment</i>,” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poetical Works</i>, 1901, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 475). Byron does not substantiate his charge of ingratitude, and there is nothing to show whether Coleridge ever knew why a once friendly countenance was changed towards him. He might have asked, with the Courtenays, <i xml:lang="la">Ubi lapsus, quid feci?</i> If Byron had been on his mind or his conscience he would have drawn up an elaborate explanation or apology; but nothing of the kind is extant.

						<p>“Everybody were at their prayers, or were confessing themselves.⁠ ⁠… The private captain of the galley caused, in the greatest height of the danger, <em>his embroidered coat and his red scarf</em> to be brought to him, saying, that a true Spaniard ought to die bearing his King’s Marks of distinction. He sat himself down in a great elbow chair, and with his foot struck a poor Neapolitan in the chops, who, not being able to stand upon the Coursey of the Galley, was crawling along, crying out aloud, ‘<i xml:lang="es">Sennor Don Fernando, por l’amor de Dios, Confession.</i>’ The captain, when he struck him, said to him, ‘<i xml:lang="es">Inimigo de Dios piedes Confession!</i>’ And as I was representing to him, that his inference was not right, he said that that old man gave offence to the whole galley. You can’t imagine the horror of a great storm; you can as little imagine the Ridicule mixed with it. A Sicilian Observantine monk was preaching at the foot of the great mast, that <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis had appeared to him, and had assured him that we should not perish. I should never have done, should I undertake to describe all the ridiculous frights that are seen on these occasions.”</p>

					<p>The first edition of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tully’s Tripoli</i> is entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Narrative of a Ten Years’ Residence in Tripoli In Africa: From the original correspondence in the possession of the Family of the late Richard Tully, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>, the British Consul</i>, 1816, 410. The book is in the form of letters (so says the Preface) written by the Consul’s sister. The description of Haidée’s <em>dress</em> is taken from the account of a visit to Lilla Kebbiera, the wife of the Bashaw (<abbr>p.</abbr> 30); the description of the furniture and refreshments from the account of a visit to “Lilla Amnani,” Hadgi Abderrahmam’s Greek wife (<abbr>pp.</abbr> 132⁠–⁠137). It is evident that the “Chiel” who took <em>these</em> “notes” was the Consul’s <em>sister</em>, not the Consul:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Lilla Aisha, the Bey’s wife, is thought to be very sensible, though rather haughty. Her apartments were grand, and herself superbly habited. Her chemise was covered with gold embroidery at the neck; over it she wore a gold and silver tissue <dfn>jileck</dfn>, or jacket without sleeves, and over that another of purple velvet richly laced with gold, with coral and pearl buttons set quite close together down the front; it had short sleeves finished with a gold band not far below the shoulder, and discovered a wide loose chemise of transparent gauze, with gold, silver, and ribbon strips. She wore round her ancles⁠ ⁠… a sort of fetter made of a thick bar of gold so fine that they bound it round the leg with one hand; it is an inch and a half wide, and as much in thickness: each of these weighs four pounds. Just above this a band three inches wide of gold thread finished the ends of a pair of trousers made of pale yellow and white silk.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Page 132.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“[Lilla] rose to take coffee, which was served in very small china cups, placed in silver filigree cups; and gold filigree cups were put under those presented to the married ladies. They had introduced cloves, cinnamon, and saffron into the coffee, which was abundantly sweetened; but this mixture was very soon changed, and replaced by excellent simple coffee for the European ladies.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Page 133.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Greek then showed us the gala furniture of her own room.⁠ ⁠… The hangings of the room were of tapestry, made in pannels of different coloured velvets, thickly inlaid with flowers of silk damask; a yellow border, of about a foot in depth, finished the tapestry at top and bottom, the upper border being embroidered with Moorish sentences from the Koran in lilac letters. The carpet was of crimson satin, with a deep border of pale blue quilted; this is laid over Indian mats and other carpets. In the best part of the room the sofa is placed, which occupies three sides in an alcove, the floor of which is raised. The sofa and the cushions that lay around were of crimson velvet, the centre cushions were embroidered with a sun in gold of highly embossed work, the rest were of gold and silver tissue. The curtains of the alcove were made to match those before the bed. A number of looking-glasses, and a profusion of fine china and crystal completed the ornaments and furniture of the room, in which were neither tables nor chairs. A small table, about six inches high, is brought in when refreshments are served; it is of ebony, inlaid with mother-of-pearl, tortoiseshell, ivory, gold and silver, of choice woods, or of plain mahogany, according to the circumstances of the proprietor.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Page 136.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“On the tables were placed all sorts of refreshments, and thirty or forty dishes of meat and poultry, dressed different ways; there were no knives nor forks, and only a few spoons of gold, silver, ivory, or coral.⁠ ⁠…”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Page 137.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The beverage was various sherbets, some composed of the juice of boiled raisins, very sweet; some of the juice of pomegranates squeezed through the rind; and others of the pure juice of oranges. These sherbets were copiously supplied in high glass ewers, placed in great numbers on the ground.⁠ ⁠… After the dishes of meat were removed, a dessert of Arabian fruits, confectionaries, and sweetmeats was served; among the latter was the date-bread. This sweetmeat is made in perfection only by the blacks at Fezzan, of the ripe date of the country.⁠ ⁠… They make it in the shape of loaves, weighing from twenty to thirty pounds; the stones of the fruit are taken out, and the dates simply pressed together with great weights; thus preserved, it keeps perfectly good for a year.”</p>

When he calculates that the reader is on the verge of pitying him, he takes care to throw him back the defiance of laughter, as if to let him know that all the Poet’s pathos is but the sentimentalism of the drunkard between his cups, or the relenting softness of the courtesan, who the next moment resumes the bad boldness of her degraded character.

					<p>Coleridge was married to Sarah Fricker, October 5; Southey to her younger sister Edith, November 15, 1795. Their father, Stephen Fricker, who had been an innkeeper, and afterwards a potter at Bristol, migrated to Bath about the year 1780. For the last six years of his life he was owner and manager of a coal wharf. He had inherited a small fortune, and his wife brought him money, but he died bankrupt, and left his family destitute.

					<p>This is a fact. A few years ago a man engaged a company for some foreign theatre, embarked them at an Italian port, and carrying them to Algiers, sold them all.

						<p>“In 1812 a Signor Guariglia induced several young persons of both sexes⁠—none of them exceeding fifteen years of age⁠—to accompany him on an operatic excursion; part to form the opera, and part the ballet. He contrived to get them on board a vessel, which took them to Janina, where he sold them for the basest purposes. Some died from the effect of the climate, and some from suffering. Among the few who returned were a Signor Molinari, and a female dancer named Bonfiglia, who afterwards became the wife of Crespi, the tenor singer. The wretch who so basely sold them was, when Lord Byron resided at Venice, employed as <i xml:lang="it">capo de’ vestarj</i>, or head tailor, at the Fenice.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“So strange, indeed, are the obliquities of admiration, that they whose opinions are much influenced by authority will often be tempted to think that there are no fixed principles in human nature for this art to rest upon.⁠ ⁠… Away, then, with the senseless iteration of the word <em>popular</em>!⁠ ⁠… The voice that issues from this spirit [of human knowledge] is that Vox Populi which the Deity inspires. Foolish must he be who can mistake for this a local acclamation, or a transitory outcry⁠—transitory though it be for years, local though from a Nation. Still more lamentable is his error who can believe that there is anything of divine infallibility in this clamour of that small though loud portion of the community ever governed by factitious influence, which under the name of the <strong>Public</strong>, passes itself upon the unthinking for the <strong>People</strong>.”</p>

					<p>The assassination alluded to took place on the 8th of December, 1820, in the streets of Ravenna, not a hundred paces from the residence of the writer. The circumstances were as described.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>[“December 9, 1820. I open my letter to tell you a fact, which will show the state of this country better than I can. The commandant of the troops is <em>now</em> lying <em>dead</em> in my house. He was shot at a little past eight o’clock, about two hundred paces from my door. I was putting on my great coat to visit Madame la Comtessa <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G.</abbr>, when I heard the shot. On coming into the hall, I found all my servants on the balcony, exclaiming that a man was murdered. I immediately ran down, calling on Tita (the bravest of them) to follow me. The rest wanted to hinder us from going, as it is the custom for everybody here, it seems, to run away from ‘the stricken deer.’⁠ ⁠… we found him lying on his back, almost, if not quite, dead, with five wounds; one in the heart, two in the stomach, one in the finger, and the other in the arm. Some soldiers cocked their guns, and wanted to hinder me from passing. However, we passed, and I found Diego, the adjutant, crying over him like a child⁠—a surgeon, who said nothing of his profession⁠—a priest, sobbing a frightened prayer⁠—and the commandant, all this time, on his back, on the hard, cold pavement, without light or assistance, or anything around him but confusion and dismay. As nobody could, or would, do anything but howl and pray, and as no one would stir a finger to move him, for fear of consequences, I lost my patience⁠—made my servant and a couple of the mob take up the body⁠—sent off two soldiers to the guard⁠—despatched Diego to the Cardinal with the news, and had him carried upstairs into my own quarters. But it was too late⁠—he was gone.⁠ ⁠… I had him partly stripped⁠—made the surgeon examine him, and examined him myself. He had been shot by cut balls or slugs. I felt one of the slugs, which had gone through him, all but the skin.⁠ ⁠… He only said, ‘O Dio!’ and ‘Gesu!’ two or three times, and appeared to have suffered little. Poor fellow! he was a brave officer; but had made himself much disliked by the people.”</p>

His consequence always depended on a woman, and he was always unfaithful to her. Nothing could equal the activity of his mind, nor the indolence of his body. No dangers could appal his courage; no difficulties force him to abandon his projects. But the success of an enterprise always brought on disgust.⁠ ⁠… Everything with him was desultory; business, pleasure, temper, carriage. His presence was a restraint on every company. He was morose to all that stood in awe of him, and caressed all such as accosted him with familiarity.⁠ ⁠… None had read less than he; few people were better informed.⁠ ⁠… One while he formed the project of becoming Duke of Courland; at another he thought of bestowing on himself the crown of Poland. He frequently gave intimations of an intention to make himself a bishop, or even a simple monk. He built a superb palace, and wanted to sell it before it was finished. In his youth he had pleased her [Catherine] by the ardour of his passion, by his valour, and by his masculine beauty.⁠ ⁠… Become the rival of Orloff, he performed for his sovereign whatever the most romantic passion could inspire. He put out his eye, to free it from a blemish which diminished his beauty. Banished by his rival, he ran to meet death in battle, and returned with glory.”</p>

						<p>“L’arrivée du comte Souvorow produisit un grand effet parmi les troupes.⁠ ⁠… La manière d’être plus que simple, puis-qu’il logeait sous une canonnière, et qu’il n’avait pas même de chaises dans sa tente, son affabilité, sa bonhomie lui conciliaient l’affection de tous les individus de son armée. Cet homme singulier qui ressemble plus à un chef de cosaques ou de Tartares, qu’au général d’une armée européenne, est doué d’une intrépidité et d’une hardiesse peu communes.⁠ ⁠… La manière de vivre, de s’habiller et de parler du comte Souvorow, est aussi singulière que ses opinions militaires.⁠ ⁠… Il mangeait dans sa tente assis par terre autour d’une natte sur laquelle il prenait le plus détestable repas. L’après-midi, un semblable repas lui servait de souper, il s’endormait ensuite pendant quelques heures, passait une partie de la nuit à chanter, et à la pointe du jour il sortait presque nu et se roulait sur l’herbe assurant que cet exercice lui était necessaire pour le préserver des rhumatismes.⁠ ⁠… Sa manière de s’exprimer dans toutes les langues est aussi singulière que toute sa façon d’être, ses phrases sont incohérentes, et s’il n’est pas insensé, il dit et fait du moins tout ce qu’il faut pour le paraître; mais il est heureux et cette qualité dont le Cardinal Mazarin faisait tant de cas, est, à bon droit, fort estimée de l’Impératrice et du Prince Potemkin⁠ ⁠… Le moment de l’arrivée du Comte Souvorow fut annoncé par une décharge générale des batteries ou camp et de la flotte.”</p>

					<p>For a detailed account of Suvóroff’s personal characteristics, see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Life of Field-Marshal Souvaroff</i>, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L. M. P.</abbr> Tranchant de Laverne, 1814, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 267⁠–⁠291; and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Suvóroff</i>, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Lieut.</abbr>-Colonel Spalding, 1890, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 222⁠–⁠229.</p>
					<p>Byron’s epithet “buffoon” (line 5) may, perhaps, be traced to the following anecdote recorded by Tranchant de Laverne (<abbr>p.</abbr> 281):</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“During the first war of Poland⁠ ⁠… he published, in the order of the day, that at the first crowing of the cock the troops would march to attack the enemy, and caused the spy to send word that the Russians would be upon them some time after midnight. But about eight o’clock Souvarof ran through the camp, imitating the crowing of a cock.⁠ ⁠… The enemy, completely surprised, lost a great number of men.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>For his “praying” (line 6), vide <abbr>ibid.</abbr>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 272, 273:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“He made a short prayer after each meal, and again when going to bed. He usually performed his devotions before an image of <abbr>St.</abbr> Nicholas, the patron saint of Russia.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>“Half-dirt” (line 5) is, however, a calumny (<abbr>ibid.</abbr> <abbr>p.</abbr> 272):</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“It was his custom to rise at the earliest dawn; several buckets of cold water were thrown over his naked body.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The same writer (<abbr>p.</abbr> 268) repudiates the charges of excessive barbarity and cruelty brought against Suvóroff by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C. F. P.</abbr> Masson, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires Secrets sur la Russie</i> (vide, <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> 1800, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 311):</p>
					<blockquote xml:lang="fr">
						<p>“Souvorow ne scroit que le plus ridicule bouffon, s’il n’étoit pas montré le plus barbare guerrier. C’est un monstre, qui renferme dans le corps d’un singe l’âme d’un chien de boucher. Attila, son compatriote, et don’t il descend, peut-être ne fut ni si heureux, ni si féroce.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Suvóroff did not regard himself as “half-demon.”</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Your pencil,” he reminded the artist Müller, “will delineate the features of my face. These are visible: but my inner man is hidden. I must tell you that I have shed rivers of blood. I tremble, but I love my neighbour. In my whole life I have made no one unhappy; not an insect hath perished by my hand. I was little; I was big. In fortune’s ebb and flow, relying on God, I stood immovable⁠—even as now.”</p>

Following in the steps of another pioneer, John Finley, he left his home in North Carolina in May, 1769, and, after numerous adventures, effected a settlement on the Kentucky river. He constructed a fort, which he named Boonesborough, and carried on a protracted campaign with varying but final success against the Indians. When Kentucky was admitted into the Union, February 4, 1791, he failed to make good his title to his property at Boonesborough, and withdrew to Mount Pleasant, beyond the Ohio. Thence, in 1795, he removed to Missouri, then a Spanish possession. Napoleon wrested Missouri from the Spaniards, only to sell the territory to the United States, with the result that in 1810 he was confirmed in the possession of 850 out of the 8000 acres which he had acquired in 1795.</p>

Just at the close of day the gentle gales retired, and left the place to the disposal of a profound calm. Not a breeze shook the most tremulous leaf. I had gained the summit of a commanding ridge, and, looking round with astonishing delight, beheld the ample plains, the beauteous tracts below. On the other hand, I surveyed the famous river Ohio, that rolled in silent dignity, marking the western boundary of Kentucky with inconceivable grandeur.⁠ ⁠… All things were still. I kindled a fire near a fountain of sweet water, and feasted on the loins of a buck, which a few hours before I had killed.⁠ ⁠… No populous city, with all the varieties of commerce and stately structures, could afford so much pleasure to my mind as the beauties of nature I found here.”</p>

					<p>The story of the attempted assassination (February 11, 1818) of the Duke of Wellington, which is dismissed by Alison in a few words (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Hist.</abbr> of Europe</i> (1815⁠–⁠1852), 1853, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 577, 578), occupies many pages of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Supplementary Despatches</i> (1865, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> 271⁠–⁠546). Byron probably drew his own conclusions as to the Kinnaird-Marinet incident, from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letter to the Duke of Wellington on the Arrest of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">M.</abbr> Marinet</i>, by Lord Kinnaird, 1818. The story, which is full of interest, may be briefly recounted. On January 30, 1818, Lord Kinnaird informed Sir George Murray (Chief of the Staff of the Army of Occupation) that a person, whose name he withheld, had revealed to him the existence of a plot to assassinate the Duke of Wellington. At 12:30 <abbr>a.m.</abbr>, February 11, 1818, the Duke, on returning to his Hotel, was fired at by an unknown person; and then, but not till then, he wrote to urge Lord Clancarty to advise the Prince Regent to take steps to persuade or force Kinnaird to disclose the name of his informant. A <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">G. W.</abbr> Chad, of the Consular Service, was empowered to proceed to Brussels, and to seek an interview with Kinnaird. He carried with him, among other documents, a letter from the Duke to Lord Clancarty, dated February 12, 1818. A postscript contained this intimation:</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“It may be proper to mention to you that the French Government are disposed to go every length in the way of negotiation with the person mentioned by Lord Kinnaird, or others, to discover the plot.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Kinnaird absolutely declined to give up the name of his informant, but, acting on the strength of the postscript, which had been read but not shown to him, started for Paris with “the great unknown.” Some days after their arrival, and while Kinnaird was a guest of the Duke, the man was arrested, and discovered to be one Nicholle or Marinet, who had been appointed <i xml:lang="fr">receveur</i> under the restored government of Louis <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVIII</span>, but during the <i xml:lang="fr">Cent jours</i> had fled to Belgium, retaining the funds he had amassed during his term of office. Kinnaird regarded this action of the French Government as a breach of faith, and in a “Memorial” to the French Chamber of Peers, and his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letter</i>, maintained that the Duke’s postscript implied a promise of a safe conduct for Marinet to and from Paris to Brussels. The Duke, on the other hand, was equally positive (see his letter to Lord Liverpool, May 30, 1818) “that he never intended to have any negotiations with anybody.” Kinnaird was a “dog with a bad name.” He had been accused (see his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Letter to the Earl of Liverpool</i>, 1816, <abbr>p.</abbr> 16) of “the promulgation of dangerous opinions,” and of intimacy “with persons suspected.” The Duke speaks of him as “the friend of Revolutionists”! It is evident that he held the dangerous doctrine that a promise to a rogue <em>is</em> a promise, and that the authorities took a different view of the ethics of the situation. It is clear, too, that the Duke’s postscript was ambiguous, but that it did not warrant the assumption that if Marinet went to Paris he should be protected. The air was full of plots. The great Duke despised and was inclined to ignore the pistol or the dagger of the assassin; but he believed that “mischief was afoot,” and that “great personages” might or might not be responsible. He was beset by difficulties at every turn, and would have been more than mortal if he had put too favourable a construction on the scruples, or condoned the imprudence of a “friend of Revolutionists.” <cite>—⁠Editor</cite> <a href="canto-9.xhtml#noteref-733" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“Catherine had been handsome in her youth, and she preserved a gracefulness and majesty to the last period of her life. She was of a moderate stature, but well proportioned; and as she carried her head very high, she appeared rather tall. She had an open front, an aquiline nose, an agreeable mouth, and her chin, though long, was not misshapen. Her hair was auburn, her eyebrows black and rather thick, and her blue eyes had a gentleness which was often affected, but oftener still a mixture of pride. Her physiognomy was not deficient in expression; but this expression never discovered what was passing in the soul of Catherine, or rather it served her the better to disguise it.”</p>

					<p>Matthew Baillie (1761⁠–⁠1823), the nephew of William Hunter, the brother of Agnes and Joanna Baillie, was a celebrated anatomist. He attended Byron (1799⁠–⁠1802), when an endeavour was made to effect a cure of the muscular contraction of his right leg and foot. He was consulted by Lady Byron, in 1816, with regard to her husband’s supposed derangement, but was not admitted when he called at the house in Piccadilly. He is said to have “avoided technical and learned phrases; to have affected no sentimental tenderness, but expressed what he had to say in the simplest and plainest terms” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Annual Biography</i>, 1824, <abbr>p.</abbr> 319).

					<p>In the Empress Anne’s time, Biren, her favourite, assumed the name and arms of the “Birons” of France; which families are yet extant with that of England.

					<blockquote>
						<p>[“Ernest John Biren was born in Courland [in 1690].

Being of a handsome figure and polite address, he soon gained the good will of the duchess, and became her secretary and chief favourite. On her being declared sovereign of Russia, Anne called Biren to Petersburg, and the secretary soon became Duke of Courland, and first minister or rather despot of Russia. On the death of Anne, which happened in 1740, Biren, being declared regent, continued daily increasing his vexations and cruelties, till he was arrested, on the 18th of December, only twenty days after he had been appointed to the regency; and at the revolution that ensued he was exiled to the frozen shores of the Oby.”</p>

Dangerous characters were let alone and tacitly encouraged to continue their career of crime, until the measure of their iniquity was full, and they “weighed forty.” If Jack was clumsy enough to be detected in a trifling theft, his “blowen” would go over to the enemy, and betray him for the sake of the Government reward (see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Classical Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>, by Francis Grose, 1823, <abbr>art.</abbr> “Weigh forty”).] <a href="canto-11.xhtml#noteref-869" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

The riddle was first read to me by a young and pretty heiress, on my praising the “drapery” of the “untochered” but “pretty virginities” (like <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Anne Page) of the <em>then</em> day, which has now been some years yesterday: she assured me that the thing was common in London; and as her own thousands, and blooming looks, and rich simplicity of array, put any suspicion in her own case out of the question, I confess I gave some credit to the allegation. If necessary, authorities might be cited; in which case I could quote both “drapery” and the wearers.

By the first will he left “all he had to the Queen for her life, Buckingham House to the Duke of Clarence,” <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and as Buckingham House had been twice sold, and the other legatees were dead, a question arose between the King and the Duke of York as to the right of inheritance of their father’s personal property.

					<p>Byron’s description of the place of his inheritance, which was to know him no more, is sketched from memory, but it unites the charm of a picture with the accuracy of a ground-plan. Eight years had gone by since he had looked his last on “venerable arch” and “lucid lake” (see “Epistle to Augusta,” stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> lines 7, 8), but he had not forgotten, he could not forget, that enchanted and enchanting scene.</p>
					<p>Newstead Abbey or Priory was founded by Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, by way of deodand or expiation for the murder of Thomas Becket. Lands which bordered the valley of the Leen, and which had formed part of Sherwood Forest, were assigned for the use and endowment of a chapter of “black canons regular of the order of <abbr>St.</abbr> Augustine,” and on a site, by the riverside to the south of the forest uplands (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LV</span> lines 5⁠–⁠8) the new stede, or place, or station, arose. It was a “Norman Abbey” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LV</span> line 1) which the Black Canons dedicated to Our Lady, and, here and there, in the cloisters, traces of Norman architecture remain, but the enlargement and completion of the monastery was carried out in successive stages and “transition periods,” in a style or styles which, perhaps, more by hap than by cunning, Byron rightly named “mixed Gothic” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LV</span> line 4). To work their mills, and perhaps to drain the marshy valley, the monks dammed the Leen and excavated a chain of lakes⁠—the largest to the northwest, Byron’s “lucid lake;” a second to the south of the Abbey; and a third, now surrounded with woods, and overlooked by the “wicked lord’s” “ragged rock” below the Abbey, half a mile to the southeast. The “cascade,” which flows over and through a stonework sluice, and forms a rocky waterfall, issues from the upper lake, and is in full view of the west front of the Abbey. Almost at right angles to these lakes are three ponds: the Forest Pond to the north of the stone wall, which divides the garden from the forest; the square “Eagle” Pond in the Monks’ Garden; and the narrow stew-pond, bordered on either side with overhanging yews, which drains into the second or Garden Lake. Byron does not enlarge on this double chain of lakes and ponds, and, perhaps for the sake of pictorial unity, converts the second (if a second then existed) and third lakes into a river.</p>
					<p>The Abbey, which, at the dissolution of monasteries in 1539, was handed over by Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> to Sir John Byron, “steward and warden of the forest of Shirewood,” was converted, here and there, more or less, into a baronial “mansion” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXVI</span>). It is, roughly speaking, a square block of buildings, flanking the sides of a grassy quadrangle. Surrounding the quadrangle are two-storied cloisters, and in the centre a “Gothic fountain” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXV</span> line 1) of composite workmanship. The upper portion of the stonework is hexagonal, and is ornamented with a double row of gargoyles (all “monsters” and no “saints,” recalling, perhaps identical with, the “seven deadly sins” gargoyles, still <i xml:lang="la">in situ</i> in the quadrangle of Magdalen College, Oxford); the lower half, which belongs to the seventeenth or eighteenth century, is hollowed into niches of a Roman or classical design. (In Byron’s time the fountain stood in a courtyard in front of the Abbey, but before he composed this canto it had been restored by Colonel Wildman to its original place within the quadrangle. Byron was acquainted with the change, and writes accordingly.) When the Byrons took possession of the Abbey the upper stories of the cloisters were converted, on three sides of the quadrangle, into galleries, and on the fourth, the north side, into a library. Abutting on the cloisters are the monastic buildings proper, in part transformed, but with “much of the monastic” preserved. On the west, the front of the Abbey, the ground floor consists of the entrance hall and Monks’ Parlour, and, above, the Guests’ Refectory or Banqueting-hall, and the Prior’s Parlour. On the south, the Xenodochium or Guesten Hall, and, above, the Monks’ Refectory, or Grand Drawing-room; on the south and east, on the ground floor, the Prior’s Lodgings, the Chapter House (“the exquisite small chapel,” stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXVI</span> line 5), the “slype” or passage between church and Chapter House; and in the upper story, the state bedrooms, named after the kings, Edward <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, who, by the terms of the grant of land to the Prior and Canons, were entitled to free quarters in the Abbey. During Byron’s brief tenure of Newstead, and for long years before, these “huge halls, long galleries, and spacious chambers” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXXVII</span> line 1) were half dismantled, and in a more or less ruinous condition. A few pictures remained on the walls of the Great Drawing-room, of the Prior’s Parlour, and in the apartments of the southeast wing or annex, which dates from the seventeenth century (see the account of a visit to Newstead in 1812, in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Beauties of England and Wales</i>, 1813, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span> 401⁠–⁠405). There are and were portraits, by Lely (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXVIII</span> line 7), of a Lady Byron, of Fanny Jennings, Duchess of Tyrconnel, “loveliness personified,” of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Hughes, and of Nell Gwynne; by Sir Godfrey Kneller, of William and Mary; by unnamed artists, of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> and George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>; and by Ramsay, of George <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>. There are portraits of a fat Prior, William Sandall, with a jewelled reliquary; of “Sir John the Little with the Great Beard,” who ruled in the Prior’s stead; and there is the portrait, a votive tablet of penitence and remorse, “of that Lord Arundel Who struck in heat the child he loved so well” (see “A Picture at Newstead,” by Matthew Arnold, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poetical Works</i>, 1890, <abbr>p.</abbr> 177); but of portraits of judges or bishops, or of pictures by old masters, there is neither trace nor record.</p>
					<p>But the characteristic feature of Newstead Abbey, so familiar that description seems unnecessary, and, yet, never quite accurately described, is the west front of the Priory Church, which is in line with the west front of the Abbey. “Half apart,” the southern portion of this front, which abuts on the windows of the Prior’s Parlour, and the room above, where Byron slept, flanks and conceals the west end of the north cloisters and library; but, with this exception, it is a screen, and nothing more. In the centre is the “mighty window” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXII</span> line 1), shorn of glass and tracery; above are six lancet windows (which Byron seems to have regarded as niches), and, above again, in a “higher niche” (stanza <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXI</span> line 1), is the crowned Virgin with the Babe in her arms, which escaped, as by a miracle, the “fiery darts”⁠—the shot and cannonballs of the Cromwellian troopers. On either side of the central window are “two blank windows containing tracery [‘geometrical decorated’]⁠ ⁠… carved [in relief] on the solid ashlar;” on either side of the window, and at the northern and southern extremities of the front, are buttresses with canopied niches, in each of which a saint or apostle must once have stood. Over the west door there is the mutilated figure of (?) the Saviour, but of twelve saints or twelve niches there is no trace. The “grand arch” is an ivy-clad screen, and nothing more. Behind and beyond, in place of vanished nave, of aisle and transept, is the smooth green turf; and at the east end, on the site of the high altar, stands the urn-crowned masonry of Boatswain’s tomb.</p>
					<p>Newstead Abbey was sold by Lord Byron to his old schoolfellow, Colonel Thomas Wildman, in November, 1817. The house and property were resold in 1861, by his widow, to William Frederick Webb, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Esq.</abbr>, a traveller in many lands, the friend and host of David Livingstone.

					<p>It would have taught him humanity at least. This sentimental savage, whom it is a mode to quote (amongst the novelists) to show their sympathy for innocent sports and old songs, teaches how to sew up frogs, and break their legs by way of experiment, in addition to the art of angling⁠—the cruelest, the coldest, and the stupidest of pretended sports. They may talk about the beauties of nature, but the angler merely thinks of his dish of fish; he has no leisure to take his eyes from off the streams, and a single <em>bite</em> is worth to him more than all the scenery around. Besides, some fish bite best on a rainy day. The whale, the shark, and the tunny fishery have somewhat of noble and perilous in them; even net fishing, trawling, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, are more humane and useful.

					<p>Once upon a time, Tiresias, who was shepherding on Mount Cyllene, wantonly stamped with his heel on a pair of snakes, and was straightway turned into a woman. Seven years later he was led to treat another pair of snakes in like fashion, and, happily or otherwise, was turned back into a man. Hence, when Jupiter and Juno fell to wrangling on the comparative enjoyments of men and women, the question was referred to Tiresias, as a person of unusual experience and authority. He gave it in favour of the woman, and Juno, who was displeased at his answer, struck him with blindness. But Jupiter, to make amends, gave him the “liberty of prophesying” for seven, some say nine, generations.

Both rooms look west, and command a view of the “lake’s billow” and the “cascade.” Moreover, the Guests’ Refectory was never hung with “old pictures.” It would seem that Don Juan (perhaps Byron on an emergency) slept in the Prior’s Parlour, and that in the visionary Newstead the pictures forsook the Grand Drawing-Room for the Hall. Hence the scene! <i xml:lang="es">El Libertado</i> steps out of the Gothic Chamber “forth” into the “gallery,” and lo! “a monk in cowl and beads.” But, <i xml:lang="es">Quien sabe</i>?

					<p>I remember that the mayoress of a provincial town, somewhat surfeited with a similar display from foreign parts, did rather indecorously break through the applauses of an intelligent audience⁠—intelligent, I mean, as to music⁠—for the words, besides being in recondite languages (it was some years before the peace, ere all the world had travelled, and while I was a collegian), were sorely disguised by the performers:⁠—this mayoress, I say, broke out with, “Rot your Italianos! for my part, I loves a simple ballat!” Rossini will go a good way to bring most people to the same opinion some day.

			<h2 epub:type="title">Introduction</h2>
			<p>Byron was a rapid as well as a voluminous writer. His <i epub:type="se:name.publication">Tales</i> were thrown off at lightning speed, and even his dramas were thought out and worked through with unhesitating energy and rapid achievement. Nevertheless, the composition of his two great poems was all but coextensive with his poetical life. He began the first canto of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Childe Harold</i> in the autumn of 1809, and he did not complete the fourth canto till the spring of 1818. He began the first canto of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> in the autumn of 1818, and he was still at work on a seventeenth canto in the spring of 1823. Both poems were issued in parts, and with long intervals of unequal duration between the parts; but the same result was brought about by different causes and produced a dissimilar effect. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Childe Harold</i> consists of three distinct poems descriptive of three successive travels or journeys in foreign lands. The adventures of the hero are but the pretext for the shifting of the diorama; whereas in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> the story is continuous, and the scenery is exhibited as a background for the dramatic evolution of the personality of the hero. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Childe Harold</i> came out at intervals, because there were periods when the author was stationary; but the interruptions in the composition and publication of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> were due to the disapproval and discouragement of friends, and the very natural hesitation and procrastination of the publisher. Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> was written in September, 1818; Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> in December-January, 1818⁠–⁠1819. Both cantos were published on July 15, 1819. Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> were written in the winter of 1819⁠–⁠1820; Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, after an interval of nine months, in October-November, 1820, but the publication of Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> was delayed till August 8, 1821. The next interval was longer still, but it was the last. In June, 1822, Byron began to work at a sixth, and by the end of March, 1823, he had completed a sixteenth canto. But the publication of these later cantos, which had been declined by Murray, and were finally entrusted to John Hunt, was spread over a period of several months. Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>, with a Preface, were published July 15; Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>, August 29; Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIV</span>, December 17, 1823; and, finally, Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span>, March 26, 1824. The composition of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>, considered as a whole, synchronized with the composition of all the dramas (except <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Manfred</i>) and the following poems: <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Prophecy of Dante</i>, (the translation of) <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Morgante Maggiore</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Vision of Judgment</i>, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Age of Bronze</i>, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Island</i>.</p>
			<p>There is little to be said with regard to the “Sources” of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>. Frere’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Whistlecraft</i> had suggested <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Beppo</i>, and, at the same time, had prompted and provoked a sympathetic study of Frere’s Italian models, Berni and Pulci (see “Introduction to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Beppo</i>,” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Poetical Works</i>, 1901, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 155⁠–⁠158; and “Introduction to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">The Morgante Maggiore</i>” ibid., <abbr>pp.</abbr> 279⁠–⁠281); and, again, the success of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Beppo</i>, and, still more, a sense of inspiration and the conviction that he had found the path to excellence, suggested another essay of the <i xml:lang="it">ottava rima</i>, a humorous poem “<i xml:lang="fr">à la Beppo</i>” on a larger and more important scale. If Byron possessed more than a superficial knowledge of the legendary “Don Juan,” he was irresponsive and unimpressed. He speaks (letter to Murray, February 16, 1821) of “the Spanish tradition;” but there is nothing to show that he had read or heard of Tirso de Molina’s (Gabriel Tellez) <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play" xml:lang="es">El Burlador de Sevilla y Convidado de Piedra</i> (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">The Deceiver of Seville and the Stone Guest</i>), 1626, which dramatized the “ower true tale” of the actual Don Juan Tenorio; or that he was acquainted with any of the Italian (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play" xml:lang="it">Convitato di Pietra</i>, del Dottor Giacinto Andrea Cicognini, Fiorentino [see <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">L.</abbr> Allacci <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play" xml:lang="it">Dramaturgia</i>, 1755, 4º, <abbr>p.</abbr> 862]) or French adaptations of the legend (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">e.g.</abbr> <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play" xml:lang="fr">Le Festin de Pierre, ou le fils criminel</i>, Tragi-comédie de De Villiers, 1659; and Molière’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play" xml:lang="fr">Dom Juan, ou Le Festin de Pierre</i>, 1665). He had seen (<i xml:lang="la">vide post</i>, <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24">note 24</a>) Delpini’s pantomime, which was based on Shadwell’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Libertine</i>, and he may have witnessed, at Milan or Venice, a performance of Mozart’s <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">Don Giovanni</i>; but in taking Don Juan for his “hero,” he took the name only, and disregarded the “terrible figure” “of the Titan of embodied evil, the likeness of sin made flesh” (see <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Selections from the Works of Lord Byron</i>, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A. C.</abbr> Swinburne, 1885, <abbr>p.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVI</span>), “as something to his purpose nothing”!</p>
			<p>Why, then, did he choose the name, and what was the scheme or motif of his poem? Something is to be gathered from his own remarks and reflections; but it must be borne in mind that he is on the defensive, and that his half-humorous paradoxes were provoked by advice and opposition. Writing to Moore (September 19, 1818), he says, “I have finished the first canto⁠ ⁠… of a poem in the style and manner of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Beppo</i>, encouraged by the good success of the same. It is⁠ ⁠… meant to be a little quietly facetious upon everything. But I doubt whether it is not⁠—at least as far as it has gone⁠—too free for these very modest days.” The critics before and after publication thought that <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> <em>was</em> “too free,” and, a month after the two first cantos had been issued, he writes to Murray (August 12, 1819), “You ask me for the plan of Donny Johnny; I <em>have</em> no plan⁠—I <em>had</em> no plan; but I had or have materials.⁠ ⁠… You are too earnest and eager about a work never intended to be serious. Do you suppose that I could have any intention but to giggle and make giggle?⁠—a playful satire, with as little poetry as could be helped, was what I meant.” Again, after the completion but before the publication of Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, in a letter to Murray (February 16, 1821), he writes, “The Fifth is so far from being the last of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>, that it is hardly the beginning. I meant to take him the tour of Europe, with a proper mixture of siege, battle, and adventure, and to make him finish as Anacharsis Cloots in the French Revolution.⁠ ⁠… I meant to have made him a <i xml:lang="it">Cavalier Servente</i> in Italy, and a cause for a divorce in England, and a Sentimental ‘Werther-faced’ man in Germany, so as to show the different ridicules of the society in each of these countries, and to have displayed him gradually <i xml:lang="fr">gâté</i> and blasé, as he grew older, as is natural. But I had not quite fixed whether to make him end in Hell, or in an unhappy marriage, not knowing which would be the severest.”</p>
			<p>Byron meant what he said, but he kept back the larger truth. Great works, in which the poet speaks <i xml:lang="la">ex animo</i>, and the man lays bare the very pulse of the machine, are not conceived or composed unconsciously and at haphazard. Byron did not “whistle” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> “for want of thought.” He had found a thing to say, and he meant to make the world listen. He had read with angry disapproval, but he had read, Coleridge’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Critique on <em>[Maturin’s]</em> Bertram</i> (<i xml:lang="la">vide post</i>, <a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11">note 11</a>), and, it may be, had caught an inspiration from one brilliant sentence which depicts the Don Juan of the legend somewhat after the likeness of Childe Harold, if not of Lord Byron: “Rank, fortune, wit, talent, acquired knowledge, and liberal accomplishments, with beauty of person, vigorous health,⁠ ⁠… all these advantages, elevated by the habits and sympathies of noble birth and natural character, are⁠ ⁠… combined in Don Juan, so as to give him the means of carrying into all its practical consequences the doctrine of a godless nature⁠ ⁠… Obedience to nature is the only virtue.” Again, “It is not the wickedness of Don Juan⁠ ⁠… which constitutes the character an abstraction,⁠ ⁠… but the rapid succession of the correspondent acts and incidents, his intellectual superiority, and the splendid accumulation of his gifts and desirable qualities as coexistent with entire wickedness in one and the same person.” Here was at once a suggestion and a challenge.</p>
			<p>Would it not be possible to conceive and to depict an ideal character, gifted, gracious, and delightful, who should “carry into all its practical consequences” the doctrine of a mundane, if not godless doctrine, and, at the same time, retain the charities and virtues of uncelestial but not devilish manhood? In defiance of monition and in spite of resolution, the primrose path is trodden by all sorts and conditions of men, sinners no doubt, but not necessarily abstractions of sin, and to assert the contrary makes for cant and not for righteousness. The form and substance of the poem were due to the compulsion of Genius and the determination of Art, but the argument is a vindication of the natural man. It is Byron’s “criticism of life.” <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> was <em>taboo</em> from the first. The earlier issues of the first five cantos were doubly anonymous. Neither author nor publisher subscribed their names on the title-page. The book was a monster, and, as its maker had foreseen, “all the world” shuddered. Immoral, in the sense that it advocates immoral tenets, or prefers evil to good, it is not, but it is unquestionably a dangerous book, which (to quote Kingsley’s words used in another connection) “the young and innocent will do well to leave altogether unread.” It is dangerous because it ignores resistance and presumes submission to passion; it is dangerous because, as Byron admitted, it is “now and then voluptuous;” and it is dangerous, in a lesser degree, because, here and there, the purport of the quips and allusions is gross and offensive. No one can take up the book without being struck and arrested by these violations of modesty and decorum; but no one can master its contents and become possessed of it as a whole without perceiving that the mirror is held up to nature, that it reflects spots and blemishes which, on a survey of the vast and various orb, dwindle into <em>natural</em> and so comparative insignificance. Byron was under no delusion as to the grossness of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>. His plea or pretence, that he was sheltered by the superior grossness of Ariosto and La Fontaine, of Prior and of Fielding, is <i xml:lang="la">nihil ad rem</i>, if it is not insincere. When Murray (May 3, 1819) charges him with “approximations to indelicacy,” he laughs himself away at the euphemism, but when Hobhouse and “the Zoili of Albemarle Street” talked to him “about morality,” he flames out, “I maintain that it is the most moral of poems.” He looked upon his great work as a whole, and he knew that the “<i xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i> of his song” was not only to celebrate, but, by the white light of truth, to represent and exhibit the great things of the world⁠—Love and War, and Death by sea and land, and Man, half-angel, half-demon⁠—the comedy of his fortunes, and the tragedy of his passions and his fate.</p>
			<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> has won great praise from the great. Sir Walter Scott (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Edinburgh Weekly Journal</i>, May 19, 1824) maintained that its creator “has embraced every topic of human life, and sounded every string of the divine harp, from its slightest to its most powerful and heart-astounding tones.” Goethe (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="de">Kunst und Alterthum</i>, 1821 [<abbr>ed.</abbr> Weimar, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 197, and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="de">Sämmtliche Werke</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span> 637]) described <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i> as “a work of boundless genius.” Shelley (letter to Byron, October 21, 1821), on the receipt of Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, bore testimony to his “wonder and delight:” “This poem carries with it at once the stamp of originality and defiance of imitation. Nothing has ever been written like it in English, nor, if I may venture to prophesy, will there be, unless carrying upon it the mark of a secondary and borrowed light.⁠ ⁠… You are building up a drama,” he adds, “such as England has not yet seen, and the task is sufficiently noble and worthy of you.” Again, of the fifth canto he writes (Shelley’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Prose Works</i>, <abbr>ed.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Buxton Forman, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 219), “Every word has the stamp of immortality.⁠ ⁠… It fulfils, in a certain degree, what I have long preached of producing⁠—something wholly new and relative to the age, and yet surpassingly beautiful.” Finally, a living poet, neither a disciple nor encomiast of Byron, pays eloquent tribute to the strength and splendour of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Don Juan</i>: “Across the stanzas⁠ ⁠… we swim forward as over the ‘broad backs of the sea;’ they break and glitter, hiss and laugh, murmur and move like waves that sound or that subside. There is in them a delicious resistance, an elastic motion, which salt water has and fresh water has not. There is about them a wide wholesome air, full of vivid light and constant wind, which is only felt at sea. Life undulates and Death palpitates in the splendid verse.⁠ ⁠… This gift of life and variety is the supreme quality of Byron’s chief poem” (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">A Selection, <abbr>etc.</abbr></i>, by <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.

			<h2 epub:type="title">Preface to Cantos <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span>, and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span></h2>
			<p>The details of the siege of Ismail in two of the following cantos (<abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">i.e.</abbr> the seventh and eighth) are taken from a French Work, entitled <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Nouvelle Russie</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> Some of the incidents attributed to Don Juan really occurred, particularly the circumstance of his saving the infant, which was the actual case of the late Duc de Richelieu, then a young volunteer in the Russian service, and afterward the founder and benefactor of Odessa, where his name and memory can never cease to be regarded with reverence.</p>
			<p>In the course of these cantos, a stanza or two will be found relative to the late Marquis of Londonderry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a> but written some time before his decease. Had that person’s oligarchy died with him, they would have been suppressed; as it is, I am aware of nothing in the manner of his death or of his life to prevent the free expression of the opinions of all whom his whole existence was consumed in endeavouring to enslave. That he was an amiable man in <em>private</em> life, may or may not be true: but with this the public have nothing to do; and as to lamenting his death, it will be time enough when Ireland has ceased to mourn for his birth. As a minister, I, for one of millions, looked upon him as the most despotic in intention, and the weakest in intellect, that ever tyrannised over a country. It is the first time indeed since the Normans that England has been insulted by a <em>minister</em> (at least) who could not speak English, and that Parliament permitted itself to be dictated to in the language of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Malaprop.</p>
			<p id="preface-p-3">Of the manner of his death little need be said, except that if a poor radical, such as Waddington or Watson,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-3" id="noteref-3" epub:type="noteref">3</a> had cut his throat, he would have been buried in a crossroad, with the usual appurtenances of the stake and mallet. But the minister was an elegant lunatic⁠—a sentimental suicide⁠—he merely cut the “carotid artery,” (blessings on their learning!) and lo! the pageant, and the Abbey! and “the syllables of dolour yelled forth”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a> by the newspapers⁠—and the harangue of the Coroner in a eulogy over the bleeding body of the deceased⁠—(an Anthony worthy of such a Caesar)⁠—and the nauseous and atrocious cant of a degraded crew of conspirators against all that is sincere and honourable. In his death he was necessarily one of two things by the law<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a>⁠—a felon or a madman⁠—and in either case no great subject for panegyric.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> In his life he was⁠—what all the world knows, and half of it will feel for years to come, unless his death prove a “moral lesson” to the surviving Sejani<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a> of Europe. It may at least serve as some consolation to the nations, that their oppressors are not happy, and in some instances judge so justly of their own actions as to anticipate the sentence of mankind. Let us hear no more of this man; and let Ireland remove the ashes of her Grattan from the sanctuary of Westminster. Shall the patriot of humanity repose by the Werther of politics!!!</p>
			<p>With regard to the objections which have been made on another score to the already published cantos of this poem, I shall content myself with two quotations from Voltaire:⁠—“<i xml:lang="fr">La pudeur s’est enfuite des coeurs, et s’est refugiée sur les lèvres.</i>”⁠ ⁠… “<i xml:lang="fr">Plus les moeurs sont dépravés, plus les expressions deviennent mesurées; on croit regagner en langage ce qu’on a perdu en vertu.</i>”</p>
			<p>This is the real fact, as applicable to the degraded and hypocritical mass which leavens the present English generation, and is the only answer they deserve. The hackneyed and lavished title of Blasphemer⁠—which, with Radical, Liberal, Jacobin, Reformer, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, are the changes which the hirelings are daily ringing in the ears of those who will listen⁠—should be welcome to all who recollect on <em>whom</em> it was originally bestowed. Socrates and Jesus Christ were put to death publicly as <em>blasphemers</em>, and so have been and may be many who dare to oppose the most notorious abuses of the name of God and the mind of man. But persecution is not refutation, nor even triumph: the “wretched infidel,” as he is called, is probably happier in his prison than the proudest of his assailants. With his opinions I have nothing to do⁠—they may be right or wrong⁠—but he has suffered for them, and that very suffering for conscience’ sake will make more proselytes to deism than the example of heterodox<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> Prelates to Christianity, suicide statesmen to oppression, or overpensioned homicides to the impious alliance which insults the world with the name of “Holy!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a> I have no wish to trample on the dishonoured or the dead; but it would be well if the adherents to the classes from whence those persons sprung should abate a little of the cant which is the crying sin of this double-dealing and false-speaking time of selfish spoilers, and⁠—but enough for the present.</p>
