									<span>Of hair-breadth scapes i’ the imminent deadly breach,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And portance in my travels’ history:</span>

									<span>Devour up my discourse: which I observing,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:</span>

									<span>’Twas pitiful, ’twas wondrous pitiful:</span>

									<span>She wish’d she had not heard it, yet she wish’d</span>
