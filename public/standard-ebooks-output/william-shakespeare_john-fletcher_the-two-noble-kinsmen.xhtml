									<span>What pushes are we wenches driven to,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When fifteen once has found us! First, I saw him;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I, seeing, thought he was a goodly man;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He has as much to please a woman in him⁠—</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If he please to bestow it so⁠—as ever</span>
									<br/>
									<span>These eyes yet look’d on: next I pitied him;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And so would any young wench, o’ my conscience,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That ever dream’d, or vow’d her maidenhead</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To a young handsome man: then I lov’d him,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Extremely lov’d him, infinitely lov’d him;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And yet he had a cousin, fair as he too;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But in my heart was Palamon, and there,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lord, what a coil he keeps! To hear him</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Sing in an evening, what a heaven it is!</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And yet his songs are sad ones. Fairer spoken</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Was never gentleman: when I come in</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To bring him water in a morning, first</span>
									<br/>
									<span>He bows his noble body, then salutes me thus,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>“Fair, gentle maid, good morrow: may thy goodness</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Get thee a happy husband!” Once he kiss’d me;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I lov’d my lips the better ten days after:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would he would do so every day! He grieves much,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And me as much to see his misery:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>What should I do, to make him know I love him?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For I would fain enjoy him say I ventur’d</span>
									<br/>
									<span>To set him free? what says the law, then? Thus much</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For law, or kindred! I will do it;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And this night or to-morrow he shall love me. <i epub:type="z3998:stage-direction">Exit.</i></span>

									<br/>
									<span>And threaten Love; and what young maid dare cross ’em?</span>

This you must do: confine her to a place where the light may rather seem to steal in than be permitted. Take upon you, young sir, her friend, the name of Palamon; say you come to eat with her, and to commune of love; this will catch her attention, for this her mind beats upon; other objects, that are inserted ’tween her mind and eye, become the pranks and friskins of her madness: sing to her such green songs of love as she says Palamon hath sung in prison; come to her, stuck in as sweet flowers as the season is mistress of, and thereto make an addition of some other compounded odours, which are grateful to the sense; all this shall become Palamon, for Palamon can sing, and Palamon is sweet, and every good thing: desire to eat with her, carve her, drink to her, and still among intermingle your petition of grace and acceptance into her favour: learn what maids have been her companions and play-feres; and let them repair to her with Palamon in their mouths, and appear with tokens, as if they suggested for him. It is a falsehood she is in, which is with falsehoods to be combated. This may bring her to eat, to sleep, and reduce what’s now out of square in her into their former law and regiment: I have seen it approved, how many times I know not; but to make the number more I have great hope in this.

								<span>New plays and maidenheads are near akin;</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Much follow’d both, for both much money gi’en,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>If they stand sound and well: and a good play,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Whose modest scenes blush on his marriage-day,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>And shake to lose his honour, is like her</span>
								<br/>
								<span>That after holy tie and first night’s stir,</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Yet still is modesty, and still retains</span>
								<br/>
								<span>More of the maid to sight than husband’s pains.</span>

								<span>Scenes, though below his art, may yet appear</span>

								<span>Worth two hours’ travel. To his bones sweet sleep!</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Content to you!⁠—If this play do not keep</span>
								<br/>
								<span>A little dull time from us, we perceive</span>
