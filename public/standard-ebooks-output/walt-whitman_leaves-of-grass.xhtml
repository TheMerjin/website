				<p>
					<span>Over the Western sea hither from Niphon come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Courteous, the swart-cheek’d two-sworded envoys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaning back in their open barouches, bare-headed, impassive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ride to-day through Manhattan.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Libertad! I do not know whether others behold what I behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the procession along with the nobles of Niphon, the errand-bearers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bringing up the rear, hovering above, around, or in the ranks marching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will sing you a song of what I behold Libertad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When million-footed Manhattan unpent descends to her pavements,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the thunder-cracking guns arouse me with the proud roar I love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the round-mouth’d guns out of the smoke and smell I love spit their salutes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the fire-flashing guns have fully alerted me, and heaven-clouds canopy my city with a delicate thin haze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When gorgeous the countless straight stems, the forests at the wharves, thicken with colors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When every ship richly drest carries her flag at the peak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When pennants trail and street-festoons hang from the windows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Broadway is entirely given up to foot-passengers and foot-standers, when the mass is densest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the façades of the houses are alive with people, when eyes gaze riveted tens of thousands at a time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the guests from the islands advance, when the pageant moves forward visible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the summons is made, when the answer that waited thousands of years answers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too arising, answering, descend to the pavements, merge with the crowd, and gaze with them.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Superb-faced Manhattan!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Comrade Americanos! to us, then at last the Orient comes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To us, my city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where our tall-topt marble and iron beauties range on opposite sides, to walk in the space between,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To-day our Antipodes comes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The Originatress comes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The nest of languages, the bequeather of poems, the race of eld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Florid with blood, pensive, rapt with musings, hot with passion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sultry with perfume, with ample and flowing garments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sunburnt visage, with intense soul and glittering eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The race of Brahma comes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>See my cantabile! these and more are flashing to us from the procession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it moves changing, a kaleidoscope divine it moves changing before us.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For not the envoys nor the tann’d Japanee from his island only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lithe and silent the Hindu appears, the Asiatic continent itself appears, the past, the dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The murky night-morning of wonder and fable inscrutable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The envelop’d mysteries, the old and unknown hive-bees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The north, the sweltering south, eastern Assyria, the Hebrews, the ancient of ancients,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vast desolated cities, the gliding present, all of these and more are in the pageant-procession.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Geography, the world, is in it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Great Sea, the brood of islands, Polynesia, the coast beyond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The coast you henceforth are facing⁠—you Libertad! from your Western golden shores,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The countries there with their populations, the millions en-masse are curiously here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The swarming market-places, the temples with idols ranged along the sides or at the end, bonze, brahmin, and llama,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mandarin, farmer, merchant, mechanic, and fisherman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The singing-girl and the dancing-girl, the ecstatic persons, the secluded emperors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Confucius himself, the great poets and heroes, the warriors, the castes, all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trooping up, crowding from all directions, from the Altay mountains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Tibet, from the four winding and far-flowing rivers of China,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the southern peninsulas and the demi-continental islands, from Malaysia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These and whatever belongs to them palpable show forth to me, and are seiz’d by me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I am seiz’d by them, and friendlily held by them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till as here them all I chant, Libertad! for themselves and for you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For I too raising my voice join the ranks of this pageant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am the chanter, I chant aloud over the pageant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chant the world on my Western sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chant copious the islands beyond, thick as stars in the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chant the new empire grander than any before, as in a vision it comes to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chant America the mistress, I chant a greater supremacy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chant projected a thousand blooming cities yet in time on those groups of sea-islands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sail-ships and steam-ships threading the archipelagoes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My stars and stripes fluttering in the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commerce opening, the sleep of ages having done its work, races reborn, refresh’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lives, works resumed⁠—the object I know not⁠—but the old, the Asiatic renew’d as it must be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Commencing from this day surrounded by the world.</span>

				<p>
					<span>And you Libertad of the world!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall sit in the middle well-pois’d thousands and thousands of years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to-day from one side the nobles of Asia come to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to-morrow from the other side the queen of England sends her eldest son to you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sign is reversing, the orb is enclosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ring is circled, the journey is done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The box-lid is but perceptibly open’d, nevertheless the perfume pours copiously out of the whole box.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Young Libertad! with the venerable Asia, the all-mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be considerate with her now and ever hot Libertad, for you are all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bend your proud neck to the long-off mother now sending messages over the archipelagoes to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bend your proud neck low for once, young Libertad.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Were the children straying westward so long? so wide the tramping?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were the precedent dim ages debouching westward from Paradise so long?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were the centuries steadily footing it that way, all the while unknown, for you, for reasons?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They are justified, they are accomplish’d, they shall now be turn’d the other way also, to travel toward you thence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shall now also march obediently eastward for your sake Libertad.</span>

				<p>
					<span>A song for occupations!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the labor of engines and trades and the labor of fields I find the developments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And find the eternal meanings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Workmen and Workwomen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were all educations practical and ornamental well display’d out of me, what would it amount to?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were I as the head teacher, charitable proprietor, wise statesman, what would it amount to?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were I to you as the boss employing and paying you, would that satisfy you?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The learn’d, virtuous, benevolent, and the usual terms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man like me and never the usual terms.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Neither a servant nor a master I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I take no sooner a large price than a small price, I will have my own whoever enjoys me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will be even with you and you shall be even with me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If you stand at work in a shop I stand as nigh as the nighest in the same shop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you bestow gifts on your brother or dearest friend I demand as good as your brother or dearest friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If your lover, husband, wife, is welcome by day or night, I must be personally as welcome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you become degraded, criminal, ill, then I become so for your sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you remember your foolish and outlaw’d deeds, do you think I cannot remember my own foolish and outlaw’d deeds?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you carouse at the table I carouse at the opposite side of the table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you meet some stranger in the streets and love him or her, why I often meet strangers in the street and love them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why what have you thought of yourself?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is it you then that thought yourself less?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is it you that thought the President greater than you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the rich better off than you? or the educated wiser than you?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Because you are greasy or pimpled, or were once drunk, or a thief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or that you are diseas’d, or rheumatic, or a prostitute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or from frivolity or impotence, or that you are no scholar and never saw your name in print,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you give in that you are any less immortal?)</span>

				<p>
					<span>Souls of men and women! it is not you I call unseen, unheard, untouchable and untouching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not you I go argue pro and con about, and to settle whether you are alive or no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I own publicly who you are, if nobody else owns.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Grown, half-grown and babe, of this country and every country, in-doors and out-doors, one just as much as the other, I see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all else behind or through them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The wife, and she is not one jot less than the husband,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The daughter, and she is just as good as the son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother, and she is every bit as much as the father.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Offspring of ignorant and poor, boys apprenticed to trades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Young fellows working on farms and old fellows working on farms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sailor-men, merchant-men, coasters, immigrants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All these I see, but nigher and farther the same I see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None shall escape me and none shall wish to escape me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I bring what you much need yet always have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not money, amours, dress, eating, erudition, but as good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I send no agent or medium, offer no representative of value, but offer the value itself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There is something that comes to one now and perpetually,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not what is printed, preach’d, discussed, it eludes discussion and print,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not to be put in a book, it is not in this book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is for you whoever you are, it is no farther from you than your hearing and sight are from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is hinted by nearest, commonest, readiest, it is ever provoked by them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You may read in many languages, yet read nothing about it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You may read the President’s message and read nothing about it there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing in the reports from the State department or Treasury department, or in the daily papers or weekly papers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or in the census or revenue returns, prices current, or any accounts of stock.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The sun and stars that float in the open air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The apple-shaped earth and we upon it, surely the drift of them is something grand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not know what it is except that it is grand, and that it is happiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that the enclosing purport of us here is not a speculation or bon-mot or reconnoissance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that it is not something which by luck may turn out well for us, and without luck must be a failure for us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And not something which may yet be retracted in a certain contingency.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The light and shade, the curious sense of body and identity, the greed that with perfect complaisance devours all things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The endless pride and outstretching of man, unspeakable joys and sorrows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wonder every one sees in every one else he sees, and the wonders that fill each minute of time forever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What have you reckon’d them for, camerado?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have you reckon’d them for your trade or farm-work? or for the profits of your store?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or to achieve yourself a position? or to fill a gentleman’s leisure, or a lady’s leisure?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Have you reckon’d that the landscape took substance and form that it might be painted in a picture?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or men and women that they might be written of, and songs sung?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the attraction of gravity, and the great laws and harmonious combinations and the fluids of the air, as subjects for the savans?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the brown land and the blue sea for maps and charts?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the stars to be put in constellations and named fancy names?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or that the growth of seeds is for agricultural tables, or agriculture itself?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Old institutions, these arts, libraries, legends, collections, and the practice handed along in manufactures, will we rate them so high?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will we rate our cash and business high? I have no objection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I rate them as high as the highest⁠—then a child born of a woman and man I rate beyond all rate.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We thought our Union grand, and our Constitution grand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not say they are not grand and good, for they are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am this day just as much in love with them as you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I am in love with You, and with all my fellows upon the earth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We consider bibles and religions divine⁠—I do not say they are not divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say they have all grown out of you, and may grow out of you still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not they who give the life, it is you who give the life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaves are not more shed from the trees, or trees from the earth, than they are shed out of you.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The sum of all known reverence I add up in you whoever you are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The President is there in the White House for you, it is not you who are here for him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Secretaries act in their bureaus for you, not you here for them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Congress convenes every Twelfth-month for you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Laws, courts, the forming of States, the charters of cities, the going and coming of commerce and mails, are all for you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>List close my scholars dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Doctrines, politics and civilization exurge from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sculpture and monuments and anything inscribed anywhere are tallied in you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gist of histories and statistics as far back as the records reach is in you this hour, and myths and tales the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you were not breathing and walking here, where would they all be?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The most renown’d poems would be ashes, orations and plays would be vacuums.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All architecture is what you do to it when you look upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Did you think it was in the white or gray stone? or the lines of the arches and cornices?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All music is what awakes from you when you are reminded by the instruments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not the violins and the cornets, it is not the oboe nor the beating drums, nor the score of the baritone singer singing his sweet romanza, nor that of the men’s chorus, nor that of the women’s chorus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is nearer and farther than they.</span>

					<span>Happiness, knowledge, not in another place but this place, not for another hour but this hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man in the first you see or touch, always in friend, brother, nighest neighbor⁠—woman in mother, sister, wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The popular tastes and employments taking precedence in poems or anywhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You workwomen and workmen of these States having your own divine and strong life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all else giving place to men and women like you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When the psalm sings instead of the singer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the script preaches instead of the preacher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the pulpit descends and goes instead of the carver that carved the supporting desk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I can touch the body of books by night or by day, and when they touch my body back again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When a university course convinces like a slumbering woman and child convince,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the minted gold in the vault smiles like the night-watchman’s daughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When warrantee deeds loafe in chairs opposite and are my friendly companions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I intend to reach them my hand, and make as much of them as I do of men and women like you.</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Song of Joys</h2>
			<p>
				<span>O to make the most jubilant song!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of music⁠—full of manhood, womanhood, infancy!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Full of common employments⁠—full of grain and trees.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O for the voices of animals⁠—O for the swiftness and balance of fishes!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O for the dropping of raindrops in a song!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O for the sunshine and motion of waves in a song!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the joy of my spirit⁠—it is uncaged⁠—it darts like lightning!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is not enough to have this globe or a certain time,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will have thousands of globes and all time.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the engineer’s joys! to go with a locomotive!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear the hiss of steam, the merry shriek, the steam-whistle, the laughing locomotive!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To push with resistless way and speed off in the distance.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the gleesome saunter over fields and hillsides!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The leaves and flowers of the commonest weeds, the moist fresh stillness of the woods,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The exquisite smell of the earth at daybreak, and all through the forenoon.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the horseman’s and horsewoman’s joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The saddle, the gallop, the pressure upon the seat, the cool gurgling by the ears and hair.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the fireman’s joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the alarm at dead of night,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear bells, shouts! I pass the crowd, I run!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sight of the flames maddens me with pleasure.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the joy of the strong-brawn’d fighter, towering in the arena in perfect condition, conscious of power, thirsting to meet his opponent.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the joy of that vast elemental sympathy which only the human soul is capable of generating and emitting in steady and limitless floods.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the mother’s joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The watching, the endurance, the precious love, the anguish, the patiently yielded life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the joy of increase, growth, recuperation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The joy of soothing and pacifying, the joy of concord and harmony.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to go back to the place where I was born,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear the birds sing once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To ramble about the house and barn and over the fields once more,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And through the orchard and along the old lanes once more.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to have been brought up on bays, lagoons, creeks, or along the coast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To continue and be employ’d there all my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The briny and damp smell, the shore, the salt weeds exposed at low water,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The work of fishermen, the work of the eel-fisher and clam-fisher;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I come with my clam-rake and spade, I come with my eel-spear,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Is the tide out? I join the group of clam-diggers on the flats,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I laugh and work with them, I joke at my work like a mettlesome young man;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In winter I take my eel-basket and eel-spear and travel out on foot on the ice⁠—I have a small axe to cut holes in the ice,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Behold me well-clothed going gayly or returning in the afternoon, my brood of tough boys accompanying me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brood of grown and part-grown boys, who love to be with no one else so well as they love to be with me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By day to work with me, and by night to sleep with me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Another time in warm weather out in a boat, to lift the lobster-pots where they are sunk with heavy stones, (I know the buoys,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O the sweetness of the Fifth-month morning upon the water as I row just before sunrise toward the buoys,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I pull the wicker pots up slantingly, the dark green lobsters are desperate with their claws as I take them out, I insert wooden pegs in the joints of their pincers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I go to all the places one after another, and then row back to the shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There in a huge kettle of boiling water the lobsters shall be boil’d till their color becomes scarlet.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Another time mackerel-taking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Voracious, mad for the hook, near the surface, they seem to fill the water for miles;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another time fishing for rock-fish in Chesapeake Bay, I one of the brown-faced crew;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Another time trailing for blue-fish off Paumanok, I stand with braced body,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My left foot is on the gunwale, my right arm throws far out the coils of slender rope,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In sight around me the quick veering and darting of fifty skiffs, my companions.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O boating on the rivers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voyage down the <abbr>St.</abbr> Lawrence, the superb scenery, the steamers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The ships sailing, the Thousand Islands, the occasional timber-raft and the raftsmen with long-reaching sweep-oars,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The little huts on the rafts, and the stream of smoke when they cook supper at evening.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>(O something pernicious and dread!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something far away from a puny and pious life!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something unproved! something in a trance!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Something escaped from the anchorage and driving free.)</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to work in mines, or forging iron,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Foundry casting, the foundry itself, the rude high roof, the ample and shadow’d space,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The furnace, the hot liquid pour’d out and running.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to resume the joys of the soldier!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To feel the presence of a brave commanding officer⁠—to feel his sympathy!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To behold his calmness⁠—to be warm’d in the rays of his smile!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To go to battle⁠—to hear the bugles play and the drums beat!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To hear the crash of artillery⁠—to see the glittering of the bayonets and musket-barrels in the sun!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To see men fall and die and not complain!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To taste the savage taste of blood⁠—to be so devilish!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To gloat so over the wounds and deaths of the enemy.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the whaleman’s joys! O I cruise my old cruise again!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I feel the ship’s motion under me, I feel the Atlantic breezes fanning me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I hear the cry again sent down from the mast-head, <q>There⁠—she blows!</q></span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again I spring up the rigging to look with the rest⁠—we descend, wild with excitement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I leap in the lower’d boat, we row toward our prey where he lies,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>We approach stealthy and silent, I see the mountainous mass, lethargic, basking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see the harpooner standing up, I see the weapon dart from his vigorous arm;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O swift again far out in the ocean the wounded whale, settling, running to windward, tows me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again I see him rise to breathe, we row close again,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I see a lance driven through his side, press’d deep, turn’d in the wound,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Again we back off, I see him settle again, the life is leaving him fast,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As he rises he spouts blood, I see him swim in circles narrower and narrower, swiftly cutting the water⁠—I see him die,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>He gives one convulsive leap in the centre of the circle, and then falls flat and still in the bloody foam.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the old manhood of me, my noblest joy of all!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My children and grand-children, my white hair and beard,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My largeness, calmness, majesty, out of the long stretch of my life.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O ripen’d joy of womanhood! O happiness at last!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I am more than eighty years of age, I am the most venerable mother,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How clear is my mind⁠—how all people draw nigh to me!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What attractions are these beyond any before? what bloom more than the bloom of youth?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What beauty is this that descends upon me and rises out of me?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the orator’s joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To inflate the chest, to roll the thunder of the voice out from the ribs and throat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To make the people rage, weep, hate, desire, with yourself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To lead America⁠—to quell America with a great tongue.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the joy of my soul leaning pois’d on itself, receiving identity through materials and loving them, observing characters and absorbing them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My soul vibrated back to me from them, from sight, hearing, touch, reason, articulation, comparison, memory, and the like,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The real life of my senses and flesh transcending my senses and flesh,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My body done with materials, my sight done with my material eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Proved to me this day beyond cavil that it is not my material eyes which finally see,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nor my material body which finally loves, walks, laughs, shouts, embraces, procreates.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the farmer’s joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Ohioan’s, Illinoisian’s, Wisconsinese’, Kanadian’s, Iowan’s, Kansian’s, Missourian’s, Oregonese’ joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To rise at peep of day and pass forth nimbly to work,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To plough land in the fall for winter-sown crops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To plough land in the spring for maize,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To train orchards, to graft the trees, to gather apples in the fall.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to bathe in the swimming-bath, or in a good place along shore,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To splash the water! to walk ankle-deep, or race naked along the shore.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to realize space!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The plenteousness of all, that there are no bounds,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To emerge and be of the sky, of the sun and moon and flying clouds, as one with them.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O the joy of a manly self-hood!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be servile to none, to defer to none, not to any tyrant known or unknown,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To walk with erect carriage, a step springy and elastic,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To look with calm gaze or with a flashing eye,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To speak with a full and sonorous voice out of a broad chest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To confront with your personality all the other personalities of the earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Know’st thou the excellent joys of youth?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joys of the dear companions and of the merry word and laughing face?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy of the glad light-beaming day, joy of the wide-breath’d games?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy of sweet music, joy of the lighted ball-room and the dancers?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joy of the plenteous dinner, strong carouse and drinking?</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Yet O my soul supreme!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Know’st thou the joys of pensive thought?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joys of the free and lonesome heart, the tender, gloomy heart?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joys of the solitary walk, the spirit bow’d yet proud, the suffering and the struggle?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The agonistic throes, the ecstasies, joys of the solemn musings day or night?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joys of the thought of Death, the great spheres Time and Space?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Prophetic joys of better, loftier love’s ideals, the divine wife, the sweet, eternal, perfect comrade?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Joys all thine own undying one, joys worthy thee O soul.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O while I live to be the ruler of life, not a slave,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To meet life as a powerful conqueror,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>No fumes, no ennui, no more complaints or scornful criticisms,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To these proud laws of the air, the water and the ground, proving my interior soul impregnable,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And nothing exterior shall ever take command of me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>For not life’s joys alone I sing, repeating⁠—the joy of death!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The beautiful touch of Death, soothing and benumbing a few moments, for reasons,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Myself discharging my excrementitious body to be burn’d, or render’d to powder, or buried,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My real body doubtless left to me for other spheres,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My voided body nothing more to me, returning to the purifications, further offices, eternal uses of the earth.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to attract by more than attraction!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How it is I know not⁠—yet behold! the something which obeys none of the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>It is offensive, never defensive⁠—yet how magnetic it draws.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to struggle against great odds, to meet enemies undaunted!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be entirely alone with them, to find how much one can stand!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To look strife, torture, prison, popular odium, face to face!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To mount the scaffold, to advance to the muzzles of guns with perfect nonchalance!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be indeed a God!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to sail to sea in a ship!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave this steady unendurable land,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave the tiresome sameness of the streets, the sidewalks and the houses,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To leave you O you solid motionless land, and entering a ship,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To sail and sail and sail!</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O to have life henceforth a poem of new joys!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To dance, clap hands, exult, shout, skip, leap, roll on, float on!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>To be a sailor of the world bound for all ports,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A ship itself, (see indeed these sails I spread to the sun and air,)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A swift and swelling ship full of rich words, full of joys.</span>

			<article id="a-song-of-the-rolling-earth-article" epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<section id="a-song-of-the-rolling-earth-1" epub:type="part">
					<h3 epub:type="ordinal">1</h3>
					<p>
						<span>A song of the rolling earth, and of words according,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were you thinking that those were the words, those upright lines? those curves, angles, dots?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No, those are not the words, the substantial words are in the ground and sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They are in the air, they are in you.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Were you thinking that those were the words, those delicious sounds out of your friends’ mouths?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No, the real words are more delicious than they.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Human bodies are words, myriads of words,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(In the best poems re-appears the body, man’s or woman’s, well-shaped, natural, gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Every part able, active, receptive, without shame or the need of shame.)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Air, soil, water, fire⁠—those are words,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I myself am a word with them⁠—my qualities interpenetrate with theirs⁠—my name is nothing to them,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though it were told in the three thousand languages, what would air, soil, water, fire, know of my name?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A healthy presence, a friendly or commanding gesture, are words, sayings, meanings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The charms that go with the mere looks of some men and women, are sayings and meanings also.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The workmanship of souls is by those inaudible words of the earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The masters know the earth’s words and use them more than audible words.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Amelioration is one of the earth’s words,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The earth neither lags nor hastens,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It has all attributes, growths, effects, latent in itself from the jump,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is not half beautiful only, defects and excrescences show just as much as perfections show.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The earth does not withhold, it is generous enough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The truths of the earth continually wait, they are not so conceal’d either,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They are calm, subtle, untransmissible by print,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They are imbued through all things conveying themselves willingly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conveying a sentiment and invitation, I utter and utter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I speak not, yet if you hear me not of what avail am I to you?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bear, to better, lacking these of what avail am I?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(Accouche! accouchez!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will you rot your own fruit in yourself there?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will you squat and stifle there?)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The earth does not argue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is not pathetic, has no arrangements,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Does not scream, haste, persuade, threaten, promise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Makes no discriminations, has no conceivable failures,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Closes nothing, refuses nothing, shuts none out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the powers, objects, states, it notifies, shuts none out.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The earth does not exhibit itself nor refuse to exhibit itself, possesses still underneath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Underneath the ostensible sounds, the august chorus of heroes, the wail of slaves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Persuasions of lovers, curses, gasps of the dying, laughter of young people, accents of bargainers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Underneath these possessing words that never fail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To her children the words of the eloquent dumb great mother never fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The true words do not fail, for motion does not fail and reflection does not fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Also the day and night do not fail, and the voyage we pursue does not fail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Of the interminable sisters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the ceaseless cotillons of sisters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the centripetal and centrifugal sisters, the elder and younger sisters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The beautiful sister we know dances on with the rest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With her ample back towards every beholder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the fascinations of youth and the equal fascinations of age,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sits she whom I too love like the rest, sits undisturb’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Holding up in her hand what has the character of a mirror, while her eyes glance back from it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glance as she sits, inviting none, denying none,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Holding a mirror day and night tirelessly before her own face.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Seen at hand or seen at a distance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Duly the twenty-four appear in public every day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Duly approach and pass with their companions or a companion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looking from no countenances of their own, but from the countenances of those who are with them,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the countenances of children or women or the manly countenance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the open countenances of animals or from inanimate things,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the landscape or waters or from the exquisite apparition of the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From our countenances, mine and yours, faithfully returning them,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Every day in public appearing without fail, but never twice with the same companions.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Embracing man, embracing all, proceed the three hundred and sixty-five resistlessly round the sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Embracing all, soothing, supporting, follow close three hundred and sixty-five offsets of the first, sure and necessary as they.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Tumbling on steadily, nothing dreading,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sunshine, storm, cold, heat, forever withstanding, passing, carrying,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soul’s realization and determination still inheriting,</span>

			<h2 epub:type="title">A Backward Glance O’er Travel’d Roads</h2>
			<p>Perhaps the best of songs heard, or of any and all true love, or life’s fairest episodes, or sailors’, soldiers’ trying scenes on land or sea, is the résumé of them, or any of them, long afterwards, looking at the actualities away back past, with all their practical excitations gone. How the soul loves to float amid such reminiscences!</p>
			<p>So here I sit gossiping in the early candlelight of old age⁠—I and my book⁠—casting backward glances over our travel’d road. After completing, as it were, the journey⁠—(a varied jaunt of years, with many halts and gaps of intervals⁠—or some lengthen’d ship-voyage, wherein more than once the last hour had apparently arrived, and we seem’d certainly going down⁠—yet reaching port in a sufficient way through all discomfitures at last)⁠—After completing my poems, I am curious to review them in the light of their own (at the time unconscious, or mostly unconscious) intentions, with certain unfoldings of the thirty years they seek to embody. These lines, therefore, will probably blend the weft of first purposes and speculations, with the warp of that experience afterwards, always bringing strange developments.</p>
			<p>Result of seven or eight stages and struggles extending through nearly thirty years, (as I nigh my threescore-and-ten I live largely on memory,) I look upon <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, now finish’d to the end of its opportunities and powers, as my definitive <i xml:lang="fr">carte visite</i> to the coming generations of the New World,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a> if I may assume to say so. That I have not gain’d the acceptance of my own time, but have fallen back on fond dreams of the future⁠—anticipations⁠—(“still lives the song, though Regnar dies”)⁠—That from a worldly and business point of view <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> has been worse than a failure⁠—that public criticism on the book and myself as author of it yet shows mark’d anger and contempt more than anything else⁠—(“I find a solid line of enemies to you everywhere,”⁠—letter from <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. S. K.</abbr>, Boston, May 28, 1884)⁠—And that solely for publishing it I have been the object of two or three pretty serious special official buffetings⁠—is all probably no more than I ought to have expected. I had my choice when I commenc’d. I bid neither for soft eulogies, big money returns, nor the approbation of existing schools and conventions. As fulfill’d or partially fulfill’d, the best comfort of the whole business (after a small band of the dearest friends and upholders ever vouchsafed to man or cause⁠—doubtless all the more faithful and uncompromising⁠—this little phalanx!⁠—for being so few) is that, unstopp’d and unwarp’d by any influence outside the soul within me, I have had my say entirely my own way, and put it unerringly on record⁠—the value thereof to be decided by time.</p>
			<p>In calculating that decision, William O’Connor and <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Bucke are far more peremptory than I am. Behind all else that can be said, I consider <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> and its theory experimental⁠—as, in the deepest sense, I consider our American republic itself to be, with its theory. (I think I have at least enough philosophy not to be too absolutely certain of anything, or any results.) In the second place, the volume is a sortie⁠—whether to prove triumphant, and conquer its field of aim and escape and construction, nothing less than a hundred years from now can fully answer. I consider the point that I have positively gain’d a hearing, to far more than make up for any and all other lacks and withholdings. Essentially, <em>that</em> was from the first, and has remain’d throughout, the main object. Now it seems to be achiev’d, I am certainly contented to waive any otherwise momentous drawbacks, as of little account. Candidly and dispassionately reviewing all my intentions, I feel that they were creditable⁠—and I accept the result, whatever it may be.</p>
			<p>After continued personal ambition and effort, as a young fellow, to enter with the rest into competition for the usual rewards, business, political, literary, <abbr>etc.</abbr>⁠—to take part in the great melee, both for victory’s prize itself and to do some good⁠—After years of those aims and pursuits, I found myself remaining possess’d, at the age of thirty-one to thirty-three, with a special desire and conviction. Or rather, to be quite exact, a desire that had been flitting through my previous life, or hovering on the flanks, mostly indefinite hitherto, had steadily advanced to the front, defined itself, and finally dominated everything else. This was a feeling or ambition to articulate and faithfully express in literary or poetic form, and uncompromisingly, my own physical, emotional, moral, intellectual, and aesthetic Personality, in the midst of, and tallying, the momentous spirit and facts of its immediate days, and of current America⁠—and to exploit that Personality, identified with place and date, in a far more candid and comprehensive sense than any hitherto poem or book.</p>
			<p>Perhaps this is in brief, or suggests, all I have sought to do. Given the nineteenth century, with the United States, and what they furnish as area and points of view, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> is, or seeks to be, simply a faithful and doubtless self-will’d record. In the midst of all, it gives one man’s⁠—the author’s⁠—identity, ardors, observations, faiths, and thoughts, color’d hardly at all with any decided coloring from other faiths or other identities. Plenty of songs had been sung⁠—beautiful, matchless songs⁠—adjusted to other lands than these⁠—another spirit and stage of evolution; but I would sing, and leave out or put in, quite solely with reference to America and today. Modern science and democracy seem’d to be throwing out their challenge to poetry to put them in its statements in contradistinction to the songs and myths of the past. As I see it now (perhaps too late,) I have unwittingly taken up that challenge and made an attempt at such statements⁠—which I certainly would not assume to do now, knowing more clearly what it means.</p>
			<p>For grounds for <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, as a poem, I abandon’d the conventional themes, which do not appear in it: none of the stock ornamentation, or choice plots of love or war, or high, exceptional personages of Old-World song; nothing, as I may say, for beauty’s sake⁠—no legend, or myth, or romance, nor euphemism, nor rhyme. But the broadest average of humanity and its identities in the now ripening nineteenth century, and especially in each of their countless examples and practical occupations in the United States today.</p>
			<p>One main contrast of the ideas behind every page of my verses, compared with establish’d poems, is their different relative attitude towards God, towards the objective universe, and still more (by reflection, confession, assumption, <abbr>etc.</abbr>) the quite changed attitude of the ego, the one chanting or talking, towards himself and towards his fellow-humanity. It is certainly time for America, above all, to begin this readjustment in the scope and basic point of view of verse; for everything else has changed. As I write, I see in an article on Wordsworth, in one of the current English magazines, the lines, “A few weeks ago an eminent French critic said that, owing to the special tendency to science and to its all-devouring force, poetry would cease to be read in fifty years.” But I anticipate the very contrary. Only a firmer, vastly broader, new area begins to exist⁠—nay, is already form’d⁠—to which the poetic genius must emigrate. Whatever may have been the case in years gone by, the true use for the imaginative faculty of modern times is to give ultimate vivification to facts, to science, and to common lives, endowing them with the glows and glories and final illustriousness which belong to every real thing, and to real things only. Without that ultimate vivification⁠—which the poet or other artist alone can give⁠—reality would seem incomplete, and science, democracy, and life itself, finally in vain.</p>
			<p>Few appreciate the moral revolutions, our age, which have been profounder far than the material or inventive or war-produced ones. The nineteenth century, now well towards its close (and ripening into fruit the seeds of the two preceding centuries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a>)⁠—the uprisings of national masses and shiftings of boundary-lines⁠—the historical and other prominent facts of the United States⁠—the war of attempted Secession⁠—the stormy rush and haste of nebulous forces⁠—never can future years witness more excitement and din of action⁠—never completer change of army front along the whole line, the whole civilized world. For all these new and evolutionary facts, meanings, purposes, new poetic messages, new forms and expressions, are inevitable.</p>
			<p>My Book and I⁠—what a period we have presumed to span! those thirty years from 1850 to ’80⁠—and America in them! Proud, proud indeed may we be, if we have cull’d enough of that period in its own spirit to worthily waft a few live breaths of it to the future!</p>
			<p>Let me not dare, here or anywhere, for my own purposes, or any purposes, to attempt the definition of Poetry, nor answer the question what it is. Like Religion, Love, Nature, while those terms are indispensable, and we all give a sufficiently accurate meaning to them, in my opinion no definition that has ever been made sufficiently encloses the name Poetry; nor can any rule or convention ever so absolutely obtain but some great exception may arise and disregard and overturn it.</p>
			<p>Also it must be carefully remember’d that first-class literature does not shine by any luminosity of its own; nor do its poems. They grow of circumstances, and are evolutionary. The actual living light is always curiously from elsewhere⁠—follows unaccountable sources, and is lunar and relative at the best. There are, I know, certain controlling themes that seem endlessly appropriated to the poets⁠—as war, in the past⁠—in the Bible, religious rapture and adoration⁠—always love, beauty, some fine plot, or pensive or other emotion. But, strange as it may sound at first, I will say there is something striking far deeper and towering far higher than those themes for the best elements of modern song.</p>
			<p>Just as all the old imaginative works rest, after their kind, on long trains of presuppositions, often entirely unmention’d by themselves, yet supplying the most important bases of them, and without which they could have had no reason for being, so <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, before a line was written, presupposed something different from any other, and, as it stands, is the result of such presupposition. I should say, indeed, it were useless to attempt reading the book without first carefully tallying that preparatory background and quality in the mind. Think of the United States today⁠—the facts of these thirty-eight or forty empires solder’d in one⁠—sixty or seventy millions of equals, with their lives, their passions, their future⁠—these incalculable, modern, American, seething multitudes around us, of which we are inseparable parts! Think, in comparison, of the petty environage and limited area of the poets of past or present Europe, no matter how great their genius. Think of the absence and ignorance in all cases hitherto, of the multitudinousness, vitality, and the unprecedented stimulants of today and here. It almost seems as if a poetry with cosmic and dynamic features of magnitude and limitlessness suitable to the human soul, were never possible before. It is certain that a poetry of absolute faith and equality for the use of the democratic masses never was.</p>
			<p>In estimating first-class song, a sufficient Nationality, or, on the other hand, what may be call’d the negative and lack of it, (as in Goethe’s case, it sometimes seems to me,) is often, if not always, the first element. One needs only a little penetration to see, at more or less removes, the material facts of their country and radius, with the coloring of the moods of humanity at the time, and its gloomy or hopeful prospects, behind all poets and each poet, and forming their birthmarks. I know very well that my <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves</i> could not possibly have emerged or been fashion’d or completed, from any other era than the latter half of the nineteenth century, nor any other land than democratic America, and from the absolute triumph of the National Union arms.</p>
			<p>And whether my friends claim it for me or not, I know well enough, too, that in respect to pictorial talent, dramatic situations, and especially in verbal melody and all the conventional technique of poetry, not only the divine works that today stand ahead in the world’s reading, but dozens more, transcend (some of them immeasurably transcend) all I have done, or could do. But it seem’d to me, as the objects in Nature, the themes of aestheticism, and all special exploitations of the mind and soul, involve not only their own inherent quality, but the quality, just as inherent and important, of <em>their point of view</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a> the time had come to reflect all themes and things, old and new, in the lights thrown on them by the advent of America and democracy⁠—to chant those themes through the utterance of one, not only the grateful and reverent legatee of the past, but the born child of the New World⁠—to illustrate all through the genesis and ensemble of today; and that such illustration and ensemble are the chief demands of America’s prospective imaginative literature. Not to carry out, in the approved style, some choice plot of fortune or misfortune, or fancy, or fine thoughts, or incidents, or courtesies⁠—all of which has been done overwhelmingly and well, probably never to be excell’d⁠—but that while in such aesthetic presentation of objects, passions, plots, thoughts, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, our lands and days do not want, and probably will never have, anything better than they already possess from the bequests of the past, it still remains to be said that there is even towards all those a subjective and contemporary point of view appropriate to ourselves alone, and to our new genius and environments, differing from anything hitherto; and that such conception of current or gone-by life and art is for us the only means of their assimilation consistent with the Western world.</p>
			<p>Indeed, and anyhow, to put it specifically, has not the time arrived when, (if it must be plainly said, for democratic America’s sake, if for no other) there must imperatively come a readjustment of the whole theory and nature of Poetry? The question is important, and I may turn the argument over and repeat it: Does not the best thought of our day and Republic conceive of a birth and spirit of song superior to anything past or present? To the effectual and moral consolidation of our lands (already, as materially establish’d, the greatest factors in known history, and far, far greater through what they prelude and necessitate, and are to be in future)⁠—to conform with and build on the concrete realities and theories of the universe furnish’d by science, and henceforth the only irrefragable basis for anything, verse included⁠—to root both influences in the emotional and imaginative action of the modern time, and dominate all that precedes or opposes them⁠—is not either a radical advance and step forward, or a new verteber of the best song indispensable?</p>
			<p>The New World receives with joy the poems of the antique with European feudalism’s rich fund of epics, plays, ballads⁠—seeks not in the least to deaden or displace those voices from our ear and area⁠—holds them indeed as indispensable studies, influences, records, comparisons. But though the dawn-dazzle of the sun of literature is in those poems for us of today⁠—though perhaps the best parts of current character in nations, social groups, or any man’s or woman’s individuality, Old World or New, are from them⁠—and though if I were ask’d to name the most precious bequest to current American civilization from all the hitherto ages, I am not sure but I would name those old and less old songs ferried hither from east and west⁠—some serious words and debits remain; some acrid considerations demand a hearing. Of the great poems receiv’d from abroad and from the ages, and today enveloping and penetrating America, is there one that is consistent with these United States, or essentially applicable to them as they are and are to be? Is there one whose underlying basis is not a denial and insult to democracy? What a comment it forms, anyhow, on this era of literary fulfilment, with the splendid day-rise of science and resuscitation of history, that our chief religious and poetical works are not our own, nor adapted to our light, but have been furnish’d by far-back ages out of their arrière and darkness, or, at most, twilight dimness! What is there in those works that so imperiously and scornfully dominates all our advanced civilization, and culture?</p>
			<p>Even Shakespeare, who so suffuses current letters and art (which indeed have in most degrees grown out of him,) belongs essentially to the buried past. Only he holds the proud distinction for certain important phases of that past, of being the loftiest of the singers life has yet given voice to. All, however, relate to and rest upon conditions, standards, politics, sociologies, ranges of belief, that have been quite eliminated from the Eastern hemisphere, and never existed at all in the Western. As authoritative types of song they belong in America just about as much as the persons and institutes they depict. True, it may be said, the emotional, moral, and aesthetic natures of humanity have not radically changed⁠—that in these the old poems apply to our times and all times, irrespective of date; and that they are of incalculable value as pictures of the past. I willingly make those admissions, and to their fullest extent; then advance the points herewith as of serious, even paramount importance.</p>
			<p>I have indeed put on record elsewhere my reverence and eulogy for those never-to-be-excell’d poetic bequests, and their indescribable preciousness as heirlooms for America. Another and separate point must now be candidly stated. If I had not stood before those poems with uncover’d head, fully aware of their colossal grandeur and beauty of form and spirit, I could not have written <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>. My verdict and conclusions as illustrated in its pages are arrived at through the temper and inculcation of the old works as much as through anything else⁠—perhaps more than through anything else. As America fully and fairly construed is the legitimate result and evolutionary outcome of the past, so I would dare to claim for my verse. Without stopping to qualify the averment, the Old World has had the poems of myths, fictions, feudalism, conquest, caste, dynastic wars, and splendid exceptional characters and affairs, which have been great; but the New World needs the poems of realities and science and of the democratic average and basic equality, which shall be greater. In the centre of all, and object of all, stands the Human Being, towards whose heroic and spiritual evolution poems and everything directly or indirectly tend, Old World or New.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>Continuing the subject, my friends have more than once suggested⁠—or may be the garrulity of advancing age is possessing me⁠—some further embryonic facts of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, and especially how I enter’d upon them. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Bucke has, in his volume, already fully and fairly described the preparation of my poetic field, with the particular and general plowing, planting, seeding, and occupation of the ground, till everything was fertilized, rooted, and ready to start its own way for good or bad. Not till after all this, did I attempt any serious acquaintance with poetic literature. Along in my sixteenth year I had become possessor of a stout, well-cramm’d one thousand page octavo volume (I have it yet,) containing Walter Scott’s poetry entire⁠—an inexhaustible mine and treasury of poetic forage (especially the endless forests and jungles of notes)⁠—has been so to me for fifty years, and remains so to this day.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></p>
			<p>Later, at intervals, summers and falls, I used to go off, sometimes for a week at a stretch, down in the country, or to Long Island’s seashores⁠—there, in the presence of outdoor influences, I went over thoroughly the Old and New Testaments, and absorb’d (probably to better advantage for me than in any library or indoor room⁠—it makes such difference <em>where</em> you read,) Shakespeare, Ossian, the best translated versions I could get of Homer, Eschylus, Sophocles, the old German Nibelungen, the ancient Hindu poems, and one or two other masterpieces, Dante’s among them. As it happen’d, I read the latter mostly in an old wood. The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> (Buckley’s prose version) I read first thoroughly on the peninsula of Orient, northeast end of Long Island, in a shelter’d hollow of rocks and sand, with the sea on each side. (I have wonder’d since why I was not overwhelm’d by those mighty masters. Likely because I read them, as described, in the full presence of Nature, under the sun, with the far-spreading landscape and vistas, or the sea rolling in.)</p>
			<p>Toward the last I had among much else look’d over Edgar Poe’s poems⁠—of which I was not an admirer, though I always saw that beyond their limited range of melody (like perpetual chimes of music bells, ringing from lower b flat up to g) they were melodious expressions, and perhaps never excell’d ones, of certain pronounc’d phases of human morbidity. (The Poetic area is very spacious⁠—has room for all⁠—has so many mansions!) But I was repaid in Poe’s prose by the idea that (at any rate for our occasions, our day) there can be no such thing as a long poem. The same thought had been haunting my mind before, but Poe’s argument, though short, work’d the sum and proved it to me.</p>
			<p>Another point had an early settlement, clearing the ground greatly. I saw, from the time my enterprise and questionings positively shaped themselves (how best can I express my own distinctive era and surroundings, America, Democracy?) that the trunk and centre whence the answer was to radiate, and to which all should return from straying however far a distance, must be an identical body and soul, a personality⁠—which personality, after many considerations and ponderings I deliberately settled should be myself⁠—indeed could not be any other. I also felt strongly (whether I have shown it or not) that to the true and full estimate of the Present both the Past and the Future are main considerations.</p>
			<p>These, however, and much more might have gone on and come to naught (almost positively would have come to naught,) if a sudden, vast, terrible, direct and indirect stimulus for new and national declamatory expression had not been given to me. It is certain, I say, that, although I had made a start before, only from the occurrence of the Secession War, and what it show’d me as by flashes of lightning, with the emotional depths it sounded and arous’d (of course, I don’t mean in my own heart only, I saw it just as plainly in others, in millions)⁠—that only from the strong flare and provocation of that war’s sights and scenes the final reasons-for-being of an autochthonic and passionate song definitely came forth.</p>
			<p>I went down to the war fields in Virginia (end of 1862), lived thenceforward in camp⁠—saw great battles and the days and nights afterward⁠—partook of all the fluctuations, gloom, despair, hopes again arous’d, courage evoked⁠—death readily risk’d⁠—<em>the cause</em>, too⁠—along and filling those agonistic and lurid following years, 1863⁠–⁠’64⁠–⁠’65⁠—the real parturition years (more than 1776⁠–⁠’83) of this henceforth homogeneous Union. Without those three or four years and the experiences they gave, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> would not now be existing.</p>
			<hr/>
			<p>But I set out with the intention also of indicating or hinting some point-characteristics which I since see (though I did not then, at least not definitely) were bases and object-urgings toward those <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves</i> from the first. The word I myself put primarily for the description of them as they stand at last, is the word Suggestiveness. I round and finish little, if anything; and could not, consistently with my scheme. The reader will always have his or her part to do, just as much as I have had mine. I seek less to state or display any theme or thought, and more to bring you, reader, into the atmosphere of the theme or thought⁠—there to pursue your own flight. Another impetus-word is Comradeship as for all lands, and in a more commanding and acknowledg’d sense than hitherto. Other word signs would be Good Cheer, Content, and Hope.</p>
			<p>The chief trait of any given poet is always the spirit he brings to the observation of Humanity and Nature⁠—the mood out of which he contemplates his subjects. What kind of temper and what amount of faith report these things? Up to how recent a date is the song carried? What the equipment, and special raciness of the singer⁠—what his tinge of coloring? The last value of artistic expressers, past and present⁠—Greek aesthetes, Shakespeare⁠—or in our own day Tennyson, Victor Hugo, Carlyle, Emerson⁠—is certainly involv’d in such questions. I say the profoundest service that poems or any other writings can do for their reader is not merely to satisfy the intellect, or supply something polish’d and interesting, nor even to depict great passions, or persons or events, but to fill him with vigorous and clean manliness, religiousness, and give him <em>good heart</em> as a radical possession and habit. The educated world seems to have been growing more and more ennuyed for ages, leaving to our time the inheritance of it all. Fortunately there is the original inexhaustible fund of buoyancy, normally resident in the race, forever eligible to be appeal’d to and relied on.</p>
			<p>As for native American individuality, though certain to come, and on a large scale, the distinctive and ideal type of Western character (as consistent with the operative political and even moneymaking features of United States’ humanity in the nineteenth century as chosen knights, gentlemen and warriors were the ideals of the centuries of European feudalism) it has not yet appear’d. I have allow’d the stress of my poems from beginning to end to bear upon American individuality and assist it⁠—not only because that is a great lesson in Nature, amid all her generalizing laws, but as counterpoise to the leveling tendencies of Democracy⁠—and for other reasons. Defiant of ostensible literary and other conventions, I avowedly chant “the great pride of man in himself,” and permit it to be more or less a motif of nearly all my verse. I think this pride indispensable to an American. I think it not inconsistent with obedience, humility, deference, and self-questioning.</p>
			<p>Democracy has been so retarded and jeopardized by powerful personalities, that its first instincts are fain to clip, conform, bring in stragglers, and reduce everything to a dead level. While the ambitious thought of my song is to help the forming of a great aggregate Nation, it is, perhaps, altogether through the forming of myriads of fully develop’d and enclosing individuals. Welcome as are equality’s and fraternity’s doctrines and popular education, a certain liability accompanies them all, as we see. That primal and interior something in man, in his soul’s abysms, coloring all, and, by exceptional fruitions, giving the last majesty to him⁠—something continually touch’d upon and attain’d by the old poems and ballads of feudalism, and often the principal foundation of them⁠—modern science and Democracy appear to be endangering, perhaps eliminating. But that forms an appearance only; the reality is quite different. The new influences, upon the whole, are surely preparing the way for grander individualities than ever. Today and here personal force is behind everything, just the same. The times and depictions from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Iliad</i> to Shakespeare inclusive can happily never again be realized⁠—but the elements of courageous and lofty manhood are unchanged.</p>
			<p>Without yielding an inch the workingman and working-woman were to be in my pages from first to last. The ranges of heroism and loftiness with which Greek and feudal poets endow’d their godlike or lordly born characters⁠—indeed prouder and better based and with fuller ranges than those⁠—I was to endow the democratic averages of America. I was to show that we, here and today, are eligible to the grandest and the best⁠—more eligible now than any times of old were. I will also want my utterances (I said to myself before beginning) to be in spirit the poems of the morning. (They have been founded and mainly written in the sunny forenoon and early midday of my life.) I will want them to be the poems of women entirely as much as men. I have wish’d to put the complete Union of the States in my songs without any preference or partiality whatever. Henceforth, if they live and are read, it must be just as much South as North⁠—just as much along the Pacific as Atlantic⁠—in the valley of the Mississippi, in Canada, up in Maine, down in Texas, and on the shores of Puget Sound.</p>
			<p>From another point of view <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> is avowedly the song of Sex and Amativeness, and even Animality⁠—though meanings that do not usually go along with those words are behind all, and will duly emerge; and all are sought to be lifted into a different light and atmosphere. Of this feature, intentionally palpable in a few lines, I shall only say the espousing principle of those lines so gives breath of life to my whole scheme that the bulk of the pieces might as well have been left unwritten were those lines omitted. Difficult as it will be, it has become, in my opinion, imperative to achieve a shifted attitude from superior men and women towards the thought and fact of sexuality, as an element in character, personality, the emotions, and a theme in literature. I am not going to argue the question by itself; it does not stand by itself. The vitality of it is altogether in its relations, bearings, significance⁠—like the clef of a symphony. At last analogy the lines I allude to, and the spirit in which they are spoken, permeate all <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i>, and the work must stand or fall with them, as the human body and soul must remain as an entirety.</p>
			<p>Universal as are certain facts and symptoms of communities or individuals all times, there is nothing so rare in modern conventions and poetry as their normal recognizance. Literature is always calling in the doctor for consultation and confession, and always giving evasions and swathing suppressions in place of that “heroic nudity”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a> on which only a genuine diagnosis of serious cases can be built. And in respect to editions of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> in time to come (if there should be such) I take occasion now to confirm those lines with the settled convictions and deliberate renewals of thirty years, and to hereby prohibit, as far as word of mine can do so, any elision of them.</p>
			<p>Then still a purpose enclosing all, and over and beneath all. Ever since what might be call’d thought, or the budding of thought, fairly began in my youthful mind, I had had a desire to attempt some worthy record of that entire faith and acceptance (“to justify the ways of God to men” is Milton’s well-known and ambitious phrase) which is the foundation of moral America. I felt it all as positively then in my young days as I do now in my old ones; to formulate a poem whose every thought or fact should directly or indirectly be or connive at an implicit belief in the wisdom, health, mystery, beauty of every process, every concrete object, every human or other existence, not only consider’d from the point of view of all, but of each.</p>
			<p>While I cannot understand it or argue it out, I fully believe in a clue and purpose in nature, entire and several; and that invisible spiritual results, just as real and definite as the visible, eventuate all concrete life and all materialism, through Time. My book ought to emanate buoyancy and gladness legitimately enough, for it was grown out of those elements, and has been the comfort of my life since it was originally commenced.</p>
			<p>One main genesis-motive of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves</i> was my conviction (just as strong today as ever) that the crowning growth of the United States is to be spiritual and heroic. To help start and favor that growth⁠—or even to call attention to it, or the need of it⁠—is the beginning, middle, and final purpose of the poems. (In fact, when really cipher’d out and summ’d to the last, plowing up in earnest the interminable average fallows of humanity⁠—not “good government” merely, in the common sense⁠—is the justification and main purpose of these United States.)</p>
			<p>Isolated advantages in any rank or grace or fortune⁠—the direct or indirect threads of all the poetry of the past⁠—are in my opinion distasteful to the republican genius, and offer no foundation for its fitting verse. Establish’d poems, I know, have the very great advantage of chanting the already perform’d, so full of glories, reminiscences dear to the minds of men. But my volume is a candidate for the future. “All original art,” says Taine, anyhow, “is self-regulated, and no original art can be regulated from without; it carries its own counterpoise, and does not receive it from elsewhere⁠—lives on its own blood”⁠—a solace to my frequent bruises and sulky vanity.</p>
			<p>As the present is perhaps mainly an attempt at personal statement or illustration, I will allow myself as further help to extract the following anecdote from a book, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Annals of Old Painters</i>, conn’d by me in youth. Rubens, the Flemish painter, in one of his wanderings through the galleries of old convents, came across a singular work. After looking at it thoughtfully for a good while, and listening to the criticisms of his suite of students, he said to the latter, in answer to their questions, (as to what school the work implied or belong’d,) “I do not believe the artist, unknown and perhaps no longer living, who has given the world this legacy, ever belong’d to any school, or ever painted anything but this one picture, which is a personal affair⁠—a piece out of a man’s life.”</p>
			<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> indeed (I cannot too often reiterate) has mainly been the outcropping of my own emotional and other personal nature⁠—an attempt, from first to last, to put <em>a Person</em>, a human being (myself, in the latter half of the nineteenth century, in America,) freely, fully and truly on record. I could not find any similar personal record in current literature that satisfied me. But it is not on <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Leaves of Grass</i> distinctively as <em>literature</em>, or a specimen thereof, that I feel to dwell, or advance claims. No one will get at my verses who insists upon viewing them as a literary performance, or attempt at such performance, or as aiming mainly toward art or aestheticism.</p>
			<p>I say no land or people or circumstances ever existed so needing a race of singers and poems differing from all others, and rigidly their own, as the land and people and circumstances of our United States need such singers and poems today, and for the future. Still further, as long as the States continue to absorb and be dominated by the poetry of the Old World, and remain unsupplied with autochthonous song, to express, vitalize and give color to and define their material and political success, and minister to them distinctively, so long will they stop short of first-class Nationality and remain defective.</p>
			<p>In the free evening of my day I give to you, reader, the foregoing garrulous talk, thoughts, reminiscences,</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
				<p>
					<span>As idly drifting down the ebb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such ripples, half-caught voices, echo from the shore.</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Concluding with two items for the imaginative genius of the West, when it worthily rises⁠—First, what Herder taught to the young Goethe, that really great poetry is always (like the Homeric or Biblical canticles) the result of a national spirit, and not the privilege of a polish’d and select few; Second, that the strongest and sweetest songs yet remain to be sung.</p>

						<span>The human-divine inventions, the labor-saving implements;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beholdest moving in every direction imbued as with life the revolving hay-rakes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steam-power reaping-machines and the horse-power machines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The engines, thrashers of grain and cleaners of grain, well separating the straw, the nimble work of the patent pitchfork,</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Under thee only they harvest, even but a wisp of hay under thy great face only,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Harvest the wheat of Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, every barbed spear under thee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Harvest the maize of Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, each ear in its light-green sheath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gather the hay to its myriad mows in the odorous tranquil barns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oats to their bins, the white potato, the buckwheat of Michigan, to theirs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gather the cotton in Mississippi or Alabama, dig and hoard the golden the sweet potato of Georgia and the Carolinas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clip the wool of California or Pennsylvania,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cut the flax in the Middle States, or hemp or tobacco in the Borders,</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">There Was a Child Went Forth</h3>
				<p>
					<span>There was a child went forth every day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the first object he look’d upon, that object he became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that object became part of him for the day or a certain part of the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or for many years or stretching cycles of years.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The early lilacs became part of this child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And grass and white and red morning-glories, and white and red clover, and the song of the phoebe-bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Third-month lambs and the sow’s pink-faint litter, and the mare’s foal and the cow’s calf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the noisy brood of the barnyard or by the mire of the pond-side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the fish suspending themselves so curiously below there, and the beautiful curious liquid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the water-plants with their graceful flat heads, all became part of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The field-sprouts of Fourth-month and Fifth-month became part of him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Winter-grain sprouts and those of the light-yellow corn, and the esculent roots of the garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the apple-trees cover’d with blossoms and the fruit afterward, and wood-berries, and the commonest weeds by the road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the old drunkard staggering home from the outhouse of the tavern whence he had lately risen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the schoolmistress that pass’d on her way to the school,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the friendly boys that pass’d, and the quarrelsome boys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the tidy and fresh-cheek’d girls, and the barefoot negro boy and girl,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the changes of city and country wherever he went.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His own parents, he that had father’d him and she that had conceiv’d him in her womb and birth’d him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They gave this child more of themselves than that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They gave him afterward every day, they became part of him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The mother at home quietly placing the dishes on the supper-table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother with mild words, clean her cap and gown, a wholesome odor falling off her person and clothes as she walks by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The father, strong, self-sufficient, manly, mean, anger’d, unjust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blow, the quick loud word, the tight bargain, the crafty lure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The family usages, the language, the company, the furniture, the yearning and swelling heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Affection that will not be gainsay’d, the sense of what is real, the thought if after all it should prove unreal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The doubts of day-time and the doubts of night-time, the curious whether and how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether that which appears so is so, or is it all flashes and specks?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men and women crowding fast in the streets, if they are not flashes and specks what are they?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The streets themselves and the façades of houses, and goods in the windows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vehicles, teams, the heavy-plank’d wharves, the huge crossing at the ferries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The village on the highland seen from afar at sunset, the river between,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shadows, aureola and mist, the light falling on roofs and gables of white or brown two miles off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The schooner near by sleepily dropping down the tide, the little boat slack-tow’d astern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hurrying tumbling waves, quick-broken crests, slapping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strata of color’d clouds, the long bar of maroon-tint away solitary by itself, the spread of purity it lies motionless in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The horizon’s edge, the flying sea-crow, the fragrance of salt marsh and shore mud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These became part of that child who went forth every day, and who now goes, and will always go forth every day.</span>

					<span>Even while you wept there by your fallen harp by the grave,</span>

					<span>What you wept for was translated, pass’d from the grave,</span>

						<span>How can you be alive you growths of spring?</span>

						<span>How can you furnish health you blood of herbs, roots, orchards, grain?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are they not continually putting distemper’d corpses within you?</span>

						<span>Is not every continent work’d over and over with sour dead?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Where have you disposed of their carcasses?</span>

						<span>Those drunkards and gluttons of so many generations?</span>

						<span>Where have you drawn off all the foul liquid and meat?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I do not see any of it upon you to-day, or perhaps I am deceiv’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I will run a furrow with my plough, I will press my spade through the sod and turn it up underneath,</span>

						<span>The bean bursts noiselessly through the mould in the garden,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The delicate spear of the onion pierces upward,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The apple-buds cluster together on the apple-branches,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The resurrection of the wheat appears with pale visage out of its graves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tinge awakes over the willow-tree and the mulberry-tree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The he-birds carol mornings and evenings while the she-birds sit on their nests,</span>

						<span>The young of poultry break through the hatch’d eggs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The new-born of animals appear, the calf is dropt from the cow, the colt from the mare,</span>

						<span>Out of its little hill faithfully rise the potato’s dark green leaves,</span>

						<span>Out of its hill rises the yellow maize-stalk, the lilacs bloom in the dooryards,</span>

						<span>The summer growth is innocent and disdainful above all those strata of sour dead.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What chemistry!</span>

						<span>That the winds are really not infectious,</span>

						<span>That this is no cheat, this transparent green-wash of the sea which is so amorous after me,</span>

						<span>That the fruits of the apple-orchard and the orange-orchard, that melons, grapes, peaches, plums, will none of them poison me,</span>

						<span>Though probably every spear of grass rises out of what was once a catching disease.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now I am terrified at the Earth, it is that calm and patient,</span>

						<span>It grows such sweet things out of such corruptions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It turns harmless and stainless on its axis, with such endless successions of diseas’d corpses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It distills such exquisite winds out of such infused fetor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It renews with such unwitting looks its prodigal, annual, sumptuous crops,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It gives such divine materials to men, and accepts such leavings from them at last.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">To a Foil’d European Revolutionaire</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Courage yet, my brother or my sister!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Keep on⁠—Liberty is to be subserv’d whatever occurs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is nothing that is quell’d by one or two failures, or any number of failures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or by the indifference or ingratitude of the people, or by any unfaithfulness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the show of the tushes of power, soldiers, cannon, penal statutes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What we believe in waits latent forever through all the continents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invites no one, promises nothing, sits in calmness and light, is positive and composed, knows no discouragement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waiting patiently, waiting its time.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Not songs of loyalty alone are these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But songs of insurrection also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am the sworn poet of every dauntless rebel the world over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he going with me leaves peace and routine behind him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stakes his life to be lost at any moment.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The battle rages with many a loud alarm and frequent advance and retreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The infidel triumphs, or supposes he triumphs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The prison, scaffold, garrote, handcuffs, iron necklace and lead-balls do their work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The named and unnamed heroes pass to other spheres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The great speakers and writers are exiled, they lie sick in distant lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cause is asleep, the strongest throats are choked with their own blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young men droop their eyelashes toward the ground when they meet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for all this Liberty has not gone out of the place, nor the infidel enter’d into full possession.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When liberty goes out of a place it is not the first to go, nor the second or third to go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It waits for all the rest to go, it is the last.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>When there are no more memories of heroes and martyrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when all life and all the souls of men and women are discharged from any part of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then only shall liberty or the idea of liberty be discharged from that part of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the infidel come into full possession.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then courage European revolter, revoltress!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For till all ceases neither must you cease.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I do not know what you are for, (I do not know what I am for myself, nor what any thing is for,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will search carefully for it even in being foil’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In defeat, poverty, misconception, imprisonment⁠—for they too are great.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Did we think victory great?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it is⁠—but now it seems to me, when it cannot be help’d, that defeat is great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that death and dismay are great.</span>

					<span>Nations ten thousand years before these States, and many times ten thousand years before these States,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Garner’d clusters of ages that men and women like us grew up and travel’d their course and pass’d on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What vast-built cities, what orderly republics, what pastoral tribes and nomads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What histories, rulers, heroes, perhaps transcending all others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What laws, customs, wealth, arts, traditions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What sort of marriage, what costumes, what physiology and phrenology,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What of liberty and slavery among them, what they thought of death and the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who were witty and wise, who beautiful and poetic, who brutish and undevelop’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a mark, not a record remains⁠—and yet all remains.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I know that those men and women were not for nothing, any more than we are for nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know that they belong to the scheme of the world every bit as much as we now belong to it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Afar they stand, yet near to me they stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some with oval countenances learn’d and calm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some naked and savage, some like huge collections of insects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some in tents, herdsmen, patriarchs, tribes, horsemen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some prowling through woods, some living peaceably on farms, laboring, reaping, filling barns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some traversing paved avenues, amid temples, palaces, factories, libraries, shows, courts, theatres, wonderful monuments.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Are those billions of men really gone?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are those women of the old experience of the earth gone?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do their lives, cities, arts, rest only with us?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Did they achieve nothing for good for themselves?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I believe of all those men and women that fill’d the unnamed lands, every one exists this hour here or elsewhere, invisible to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In exact proportion to what he or she grew from in life, and out of what he or she did, felt, became, loved, sinn’d, in life.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I believe that was not the end of those nations or any person of them, any more than this shall be the end of my nation, or of me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of their languages, governments, marriage, literature, products, games, wars, manners, crimes, prisons, slaves, heroes, poets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I suspect their results curiously await in the yet unseen world, counterparts of what accrued to them in the seen world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I suspect I shall meet them there,</span>

					<span>I suspect I shall there find each old particular of those unnamed lands.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Song of Prudence</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Manhattan’s streets I saunter’d pondering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On Time, Space, Reality⁠—on such as these, and abreast with them Prudence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The last explanation always remains to be made about prudence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little and large alike drop quietly aside from the prudence that suits immortality.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The soul is of itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All verges to it, all has reference to what ensues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that a person does, says, thinks, is of consequence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a move can a man or woman make, that affects him or her in a day, month, any part of the direct lifetime, or the hour of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the same affects him or her onward afterward through the indirect lifetime.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The indirect is just as much as the direct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The spirit receives from the body just as much as it gives to the body, if not more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not one word or deed, not venereal sore, discoloration, privacy of the onanist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Putridity of gluttons or rum-drinkers, peculation, cunning, betrayal, murder, seduction, prostitution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But has results beyond death as really as before death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Charity and personal force are the only investments worth anything.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>No specification is necessary, all that a male or female does, that is vigorous, benevolent, clean, is so much profit to him or her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the unshakable order of the universe and through the whole scope of it forever.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who has been wise receives interest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Savage, felon, President, judge, farmer, sailor, mechanic, literat, young, old, it is the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The interest will come round⁠—all will come round.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Singly, wholly, to affect now, affected their time, will forever affect, all of the past and all of the present and all of the future,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the brave actions of war and peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All help given to relatives, strangers, the poor, old, sorrowful, young children, widows, the sick, and to shunn’d persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All self-denial that stood steady and aloof on wrecks, and saw others fill the seats of the boats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All offering of substance or life for the good old cause, or for a friend’s sake, or opinion’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All pains of enthusiasts scoff’d at by their neighbors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the limitless sweet love and precious suffering of mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All honest men baffled in strifes recorded or unrecorded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the grandeur and good of ancient nations whose fragments we inherit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the good of the dozens of ancient nations unknown to us by name, date, location,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that was ever manfully begun, whether it succeeded or no,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All suggestions of the divine mind of man or the divinity of his mouth, or the shaping of his great hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that is well thought or said this day on any part of the globe, or on any of the wandering stars, or on any of the fix’d stars, by those there as we are here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All that is henceforth to be thought or done by you whoever you are, or by any one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These inure, have inured, shall inure, to the identities from which they sprang, or shall spring.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Did you guess anything lived only its moment?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world does not so exist, no parts palpable or impalpable so exist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No consummation exists without being from some long previous consummation, and that from some other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the farthest conceivable one coming a bit nearer the beginning than any.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whatever satisfies souls is true;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Prudence entirely satisfies the craving and glut of souls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itself only finally satisfies the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul has that measureless pride which revolts from every lesson but its own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I breathe the word of the prudence that walks abreast with time, space, reality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That answers the pride which refuses every lesson but its own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What is prudence is indivisible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declines to separate one part of life from every part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divides not the righteous from the unrighteous or the living from the dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Matches every thought or act by its correlative,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knows no possible forgiveness or deputed atonement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knows that the young man who composedly peril’d his life and lost it has done exceedingly well for himself without doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he who never peril’d his life, but retains it to old age in riches and ease, has probably achiev’d nothing for himself worth mentioning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Knows that only that person has really learn’d who has learn’d to prefer results,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who favors body and soul the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who perceives the indirect assuredly following the direct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who in his spirit in any emergency whatever neither hurries nor avoids death.</span>

					<span>Or flitting among the trees of the apple-orchard, building the nest of his mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The melted snow of March, the willow sending forth its yellow-green sprouts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For spring-time is here! the summer is here! and what is this in it and from it?</span>

					<span>Thou, soul, unloosen’d⁠—the restlessness after I know not what;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come, let us lag here no longer, let us be up and away!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O if one could but fly like a bird!</span>

					<span>O to escape, to sail forth as in a ship!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To glide with thee O soul, o’er all, in all, as a ship o’er the waters;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gathering these hints, the preludes, the blue sky, the grass, the morning drops of dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lilac-scent, the bushes with dark green heart-shaped leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wood-violets, the little delicate pale blossoms called innocence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Samples and sorts not for themselves alone, but for their atmosphere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To grace the bush I love⁠—to sing with the birds,</span>

					<span>Why, who makes much of a miracle?</span>

					<span>As to me I know of nothing else but miracles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether I walk the streets of Manhattan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or dart my sight over the roofs of houses toward the sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or wade with naked feet along the beach just in the edge of the water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or stand under trees in the woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or talk by day with any one I love, or sleep in the bed at night with any one I love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or sit at table at dinner with the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or look at strangers opposite me riding in the car,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or watch honey-bees busy around the hive of a summer forenoon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or animals feeding in the fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or birds, or the wonderfulness of insects in the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the wonderfulness of the sundown, or of stars shining so quiet and bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the exquisite delicate thin curve of the new moon in spring;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These with the rest, one and all, are to me miracles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whole referring, yet each distinct and in its place.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To me every hour of the light and dark is a miracle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every cubic inch of space is a miracle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every square yard of the surface of the earth is spread with the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every foot of the interior swarms with the same.</span>

					<span>He will take the wildest steer in the world and break him and tame him,</span>

					<span>He will go fearless without any whip where the young bullock chafes up and down the yard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bullock’s head tosses restless high in the air with raging eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet see you! how soon his rage subsides⁠—how soon this tamer tames him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See you! on the farms hereabout a hundred oxen young and old, and he is the man who has tamed them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all know him, all are affectionate to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See you! some are such beautiful animals, so lofty looking;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some are buff-color’d, some mottled, one has a white line running along his back, some are brindled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some have wide flaring horns (a good sign)⁠—see you! the bright hides,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>How they watch their tamer⁠—they wish him near them⁠—how they turn to look after him!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What yearning expression! how uneasy they are when he moves away from them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now I marvel what it can be he appears to them, (books, politics, poems, depart⁠—all else departs,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I confess I envy only his fascination⁠—my silent, illiterate friend,</span>

					<span class="i1">Pioneers! O pioneers!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">All the past we leave behind,</span>

					<span>We debouch upon a newer mightier world, varied world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fresh and strong the world we seize, world of labor and the march,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pioneers! O pioneers!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">We detachments steady throwing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down the edges, through the passes, up the mountains steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conquering, holding, daring, venturing as we go the unknown ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pioneers! O pioneers!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">We primeval forests felling,</span>

					<span>All for primal needed work, while the followers there in embryo wait behind,</span>

					<span>We to-day’s procession heading, we the route for travel clearing,</span>

					<span>O you young and elder daughters! O you mothers and you wives!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never must you be divided, in our ranks you move united,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pioneers! O pioneers!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Minstrels latent on the prairies!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Shrouded bards of other lands, you may rest, you have done your work,)</span>

					<span class="i1">Pioneers! O pioneers!</span>

					<span class="i1">Not for delectations sweet,</span>

					<span>Not the cushion and the slipper, not the peaceful and the studious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not the riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Do the feasters gluttonous feast?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do the corpulent sleepers sleep? have they lock’d and bolted doors?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still be ours the diet hard, and the blanket on the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pioneers! O pioneers!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span class="i1">Has the night descended?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was the road of late so toilsome? did we stop discouraged nodding on our way?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet a passing hour I yield you in your tracks to pause oblivious,</span>

					<span>Far, far off the daybreak call⁠—hark! how loud and clear I hear it wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swift! to the head of the army!⁠—swift! spring to your places,</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">To You</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Whoever you are, I fear you are walking the walks of dreams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I fear these supposed realities are to melt from under your feet and hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even now your features, joys, speech, house, trade, manners, troubles, follies, costume, crimes, dissipate away from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your true soul and body appear before me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stand forth out of affairs, out of commerce, shops, work, farms, clothes, the house, buying, selling, eating, drinking, suffering, dying.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whoever you are, now I place my hand upon you, that you be my poem,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I whisper with my lips close to your ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have loved many women and men, but I love none better than you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I have been dilatory and dumb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should have made my way straight to you long ago,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I should have blabb’d nothing but you, I should have chanted nothing but you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will leave all and come and make the hymns of you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None has understood you, but I understand you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None has done justice to you, you have not done justice to yourself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None but has found you imperfect, I only find no imperfection in you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None but would subordinate you, I only am he who will never consent to subordinate you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I only am he who places over you no master, owner, better, God, beyond what waits intrinsically in yourself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Painters have painted their swarming groups and the centre-figure of all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the head of the centre-figure spreading a nimbus of gold-color’d light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I paint myriads of heads, but paint no head without its nimbus of gold-color’d light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From my hand from the brain of every man and woman it streams, effulgently flowing forever.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I could sing such grandeurs and glories about you!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You have not known what you are, you have slumber’d upon yourself all your life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your eyelids have been the same as closed most of the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What you have done returns already in mockeries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Your thrift, knowledge, prayers, if they do not return in mockeries, what is their return?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The mockeries are not you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underneath them and within them I see you lurk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pursue you where none else has pursued you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silence, the dusk, the flippant expression, the night, the accustom’d routine, if these conceal you from others or from yourself, they do not conceal you from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shaved face, the unsteady eye, the impure complexion, if these balk others they do not balk me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pert apparel, the deform’d attitude, drunkenness, greed, premature death, all these I part aside.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There is no endowment in man or woman that is not tallied in you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no virtue, no beauty in man or woman, but as good is in you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No pluck, no endurance in others, but as good is in you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No pleasure waiting for others, but an equal pleasure waits for you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>As for me, I give nothing to any one except I give the like carefully to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I sing the songs of the glory of none, not God, sooner than I sing the songs of the glory of you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whoever you are! claim your own at any hazard!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These shows of the East and West are tame compared to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These immense meadows, these interminable rivers, you are immense and interminable as they,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These furies, elements, storms, motions of Nature, throes of apparent dissolution, you are he or she who is master or mistress over them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Master or mistress in your own right over Nature, elements, pain, passion, dissolution.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The hopples fall from your ankles, you find an unfailing sufficiency,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old or young, male or female, rude, low, rejected by the rest, whatever you are promulges itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through birth, life, death, burial, the means are provided, nothing is scanted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through angers, losses, ambition, ignorance, ennui, what you are picks its way.</span>

					<p epub:type="bridgehead">The 18th Year of These States</p>
				</header>
				<p>
					<span>A great year and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A harsh discordant natal scream out-sounding, to touch the mother’s heart closer than any yet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I walk’d the shores of my Eastern sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard over the waves the little voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw the divine infant where she woke mournfully wailing, amid the roar of cannon, curses, shouts, crash of falling buildings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not so sick from the blood in the gutters running, nor from the single corpses, nor those in heaps, nor those borne away in the tumbrils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was not so desperate at the battues of death⁠—was not so shock’d at the repeated fusillades of the guns.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Pale, silent, stern, what could I say to that long-accrued retribution?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could I wish humanity different?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could I wish the people made of wood and stone?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or that there be no justice in destiny or time?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O Liberty! O mate for me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here too the blaze, the grape-shot and the axe, in reserve, to fetch them out in case of need,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here too, though long represt, can never be destroy’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here too could rise at last murdering and ecstatic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here too demanding full arrears of vengeance.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hence I sign this salute over the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I do not deny that terrible red birth and baptism,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But remember the little voice that I heard wailing, and wait with perfect trust, no matter how long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from to-day sad and cogent I maintain the bequeath’d cause, as for all lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I send these words to Paris with my love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I guess some chansonniers there will understand them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I guess there is latent music yet in France, floods of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O I hear already the bustle of instruments, they will soon be drowning all that would interrupt them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O I think the east wind brings a triumphal and free march,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It reaches hither, it swells me to joyful madness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will run transpose it in words, to justify it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will yet sing a song for you ma femme.</span>

					<span>Myself and mine gymnastic ever,</span>

					<span>To stand the cold or heat, to take good aim with a gun, to sail a boat, to manage horses, to beget superb children,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak readily and clearly, to feel at home among common people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to hold our own in terrible positions on land and sea.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not for an embroiderer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(There will always be plenty of embroiderers, I welcome them also,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for the fibre of things and for inherent men and women.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not to chisel ornaments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to chisel with free stroke the heads and limbs of plenteous supreme Gods, that the States may realize them walking and talking.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let me have my own way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let others promulge the laws, I will make no account of the laws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let others praise eminent men and hold up peace, I hold up agitation and conflict,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I praise no eminent man, I rebuke to his face the one that was thought most worthy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Who are you? and what are you secretly guilty of all your life?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will you turn aside all your life? will you grub and chatter all your life?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And who are you, blabbing by rote, years, pages, languages, reminiscences,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unwitting to-day that you do not know how to speak properly a single word?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let others finish specimens, I never finish specimens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I start them by exhaustless laws as Nature does, fresh and modern continually.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I give nothing as duties,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What others give as duties I give as living impulses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Shall I give the heart’s action as a duty?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Let others dispose of questions, I dispose of nothing, I arouse unanswerable questions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who are they I see and touch, and what about them?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What about these likes of myself that draw me so close by tender directions and indirections?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I call to the world to distrust the accounts of my friends, but listen to my enemies, as I myself do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I charge you forever reject those who would expound me, for I cannot expound myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I charge that there be no theory or school founded out of me,</span>

					<span>I henceforth tread the world chaste, temperate, an early riser, a steady grower,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every hour the semen of centuries, and still of centuries.</span>
				</p>

					<span>I must follow up these continual lessons of the air, water, earth,</span>

					<span>I would bind in words retrospective some of your deeds and signs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would sing your contest for the 19th Presidentiad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would sing how an old man, tall, with white hair, mounted the scaffold in Virginia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I was at hand, silent I stood with teeth shut close, I watch’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood very near you old man when cool and indifferent, but trembling with age and your unheal’d wounds, you mounted the scaffold;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would sing in my copious song your census returns of the States,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tables of population and products, I would sing of your ships and their cargoes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The proud black ships of Manhattan arriving, some fill’d with immigrants, some from the isthmus with cargoes of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Songs thereof would I sing, to all that hitherward comes would I welcome give,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you would I sing, fair stripling! welcome to you from me, young prince of England!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Remember you surging Manhattan’s crowds as you pass’d with your cortege of nobles?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There in the crowds stood I, and singled you out with attachment;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor forget I to sing of the wonder, the ship as she swam up my bay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well-shaped and stately the Great Eastern swam up my bay, she was 600 feet long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her moving swiftly surrounded by myriads of small craft I forget not to sing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the comet that came unannounced out of the north flaring in heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the strange huge meteor-procession dazzling and clear shooting over our heads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(A moment, a moment long it sail’d its balls of unearthly light over our heads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then departed, dropt in the night, and was gone;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of such, and fitful as they, I sing⁠—with gleams from them would I gleam and patch these chants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your chants, O year all mottled with evil and good⁠—year of forebodings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Year of comets and meteors transient and strange⁠—lo! even here one equally transient and strange!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I flit through you hastily, soon to fall and be gone, what is this chant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What am I myself but one of your meteors?</span>

						<span>Ages, precedents, have long been accumulating undirected materials,</span>

						<span>America brings builders, and brings its own styles.</span>

						<span>Does not repel them or the past or what they have produced under their forms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Takes the lesson with calmness, perceives the corpse slowly borne from the house,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perceives that it waits a little while in the door, that it was fittest for its days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That its life has descended to the stalwart and well-shaped heir who approaches,</span>

						<span>His first parts substances, earth, water, animals, trees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Built of the common stock, having room for far and near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Used to dispense with other lands, incarnating this land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attracting it body and soul to himself, hanging on its neck with incomparable love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plunging his seminal muscle into its merits and demerits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Making its cities, beginnings, events, diversities, wars, vocal in him,</span>

						<span>Surrounding the noble character of mechanics and farmers, especially the young men,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>The freshness and candor of their physiognomy, the copiousness and decision of their phrenology,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The picturesque looseness of their carriage, their fierceness when wrong’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fluency of their speech, their delight in music, their curiosity, good temper and open-handedness, the whole composite make,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prevailing ardor and enterprise, the large amativeness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The perfect equality of the female with the male, the fluid movement of the population,</span>

						<span>The superior marine, free commerce, fisheries, whaling, gold-digging,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wharf-hemm’d cities, railroad and steamboat lines intersecting all points,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Factories, mercantile life, labor-saving machinery, the Northeast, Northwest, Southwest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Manhattan firemen, the Yankee swap, southern plantation life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slavery⁠—the murderous, treacherous conspiracy to raise it upon the ruins of all the rest,</span>

						<span>I listened to the Phantom by Ontario’s shore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I heard the voice arising demanding bards,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By them all native and grand, by them alone can these States be fused into the compact organism of a Nation.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To hold men together by paper and seal or by compulsion is no account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That only holds men together which aggregates all in a living principle, as the hold of the limbs of the body or the fibres of plants.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Of all races and eras these States with veins full of poetical stuff most need poets, and are to have the greatest, and use them the greatest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their Presidents shall not be their common referee so much as their poets shall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(Soul of love and tongue of fire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eye to pierce the deepest deeps and sweep the world!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ah Mother, prolific and full in all besides, yet how long barren, barren?)</span>

						<span>Of these States the poet is the equable man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not in him but off from him things are grotesque, eccentric, fail of their full returns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nothing out of its place is good, nothing in its place is bad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He bestows on every object or quality its fit proportion, neither more nor less,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is the arbiter of the diverse, he is the key,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is the equalizer of his age and land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He supplies what wants supplying, he checks what wants checking,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In peace out of him speaks the spirit of peace, large, rich, thrifty, building populous towns, encouraging agriculture, arts, commerce, lighting the study of man, the soul, health, immortality, government,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In war he is the best backer of the war, he fetches artillery as good as the engineer’s, he can make every word he speaks draw blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The years straying toward infidelity he withholds by his steady faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is no arguer, he is judgment, (Nature accepts him absolutely,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He judges not as the judge judges but as the sun falling round a helpless thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he sees the farthest he has the most faith,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His thoughts are the hymns of the praise of things,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the dispute on God and eternity he is silent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sees eternity less like a play with a prologue and denouement,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sees eternity in men and women, he does not see men and women as dreams or dots.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For the great Idea, the idea of perfect and free individuals,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For that, the bard walks in advance, leader of leaders,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The attitude of him cheers up slaves and horrifies foreign despots.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Without extinction is Liberty, without retrograde is Equality,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They live in the feelings of young men and the best women,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Not for nothing have the indomitable heads of the earth been always ready to fall for Liberty.)</span>

						<span>Can you hold your hand against all seductions, follies, whirls, fierce contentions? are you very strong? are you really of the whole People?</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>To get betimes in Boston town I rose this morning early,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here’s a good place at the corner, I must stand and see the show.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Clear the way there Jonathan!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Way for the President’s marshal⁠—way for the government cannon!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Way for the Federal foot and dragoons, (and the apparitions copiously tumbling.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I love to look on the Stars and Stripes, I hope the fifes will play Yankee Doodle.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How bright shine the cutlasses of the foremost troops!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every man holds his revolver, marching stiff through Boston town.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A fog follows, antiques of the same come limping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some appear wooden-legged, and some appear bandaged and bloodless.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Why this is indeed a show⁠—it has called the dead out of the earth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old graveyards of the hills have hurried to see!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Phantoms! phantoms countless by flank and rear!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cock’d hats of mothy mould⁠—crutches made of mist!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arms in slings⁠—old men leaning on young men’s shoulders.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What troubles you Yankee phantoms? what is all this chattering of bare gums?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Does the ague convulse your limbs? do you mistake your crutches for firelocks and level them?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If you blind your eyes with tears you will not see the President’s marshal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If you groan such groans you might balk the government cannon.</span>

					<span>I will whisper it to the Mayor, he shall send a committee to England,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They shall get a grant from the Parliament, go with a cart to the royal vault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dig out King George’s coffin, unwrap him quick from the grave-clothes, box up his bones for a journey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Find a swift Yankee clipper⁠—here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up with your anchor⁠—shake out your sails⁠—steer straight toward Boston bay.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This centre-piece for them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look, all orderly citizens⁠—look from the windows, women!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The committee open the box, set up the regal ribs, glue those that will not stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clap the skull on top of the ribs, and clap a crown on top of the skull.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You have got your revenge, old buster⁠—the crown is come to its own, and more than its own.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Stick your hands in your pockets, Jonathan⁠—you are a made man from this day,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Suddenly out of its stale and drowsy lair, the lair of slaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like lightning it le’pt forth half startled at itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its feet upon the ashes and the rags, its hands tight to the throats of kings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O hope and faith!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O aching close of exiled patriots’ lives!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O many a sicken’d heart!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn back unto this day and make yourselves afresh.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And you, paid to defile the People⁠—you liars, mark!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for numberless agonies, murders, lusts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For court thieving in its manifold mean forms, worming from his simplicity the poor man’s wages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For many a promise sworn by royal lips and broken and laugh’d at in the breaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in their power not for all these did the blows strike revenge, or the heads of the nobles fall;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The People scorn’d the ferocity of kings.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the sweetness of mercy brew’d bitter destruction, and the frighten’d monarchs come back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each comes in state with his train, hangman, priest, tax-gatherer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soldier, lawyer, lord, jailer, and sycophant.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yet behind all lowering stealing, lo, a shape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vague as the night, draped interminably, head, front and form, in scarlet folds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whose face and eyes none may see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of its robes only this, the red robes lifted by the arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One finger crook’d pointed high over the top, like the head of a snake appears.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Meanwhile corpses lie in new-made graves, bloody corpses of young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rope of the gibbet hangs heavily, the bullets of princes are flying, the creatures of power laugh aloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all these things bear fruits, and they are good.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Those corpses of young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those martyrs that hang from the gibbets, those hearts pierc’d by the gray lead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cold and motionless as they seem live elsewhere with unslaughter’d vitality.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They live in other young men O kings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They live in brothers again ready to defy you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were purified by death, they were taught and exalted.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not a grave of the murder’d for freedom but grows seed for freedom, in its turn to bear seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which the winds carry afar and re-sow, and the rains and the snows nourish.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not a disembodied spirit can the weapons of tyrants let loose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But it stalks invisibly over the earth, whispering, counseling, cautioning.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Liberty, let others despair of you⁠—I never despair of you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Is the house shut? is the master away?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nevertheless, be ready, be not weary of watching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He will soon return, his messengers come anon.</span>

					<span>Clear to me now standards not yet publish’d, clear to me that my soul,</span>

					<span>That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here by myself away from the clank of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tallying and talk’d to here by tongues aromatic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No longer abash’d, (for in this secluded spot I can respond as I would not dare elsewhere,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself, yet contains all the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resolv’d to sing no songs to-day but those of manly attachment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Projecting them along that substantial life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bequeathing hence types of athletic love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Afternoon this delicious Ninth-month in my forty-first year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I proceed for all who are or have been young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell the secret of my nights and days,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To celebrate the need of comrades.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Scented Herbage of My Breast</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Scented herbage of my breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leaves from you I glean, I write, to be perused best afterwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tomb-leaves, body-leaves growing up above me above death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perennial roots, tall leaves, O the winter shall not freeze you delicate leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every year shall you bloom again, out from where you retired you shall emerge again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhale your faint odor, but I believe a few will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O slender leaves! O blossoms of my blood! I permit you to tell in your own way of the heart that is under you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves, you are not happiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You are often more bitter than I can bear, you burn and sting me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet you are beautiful to me you faint-tinged roots, you make me think of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death is beautiful from you, (what indeed is finally beautiful except death and love?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers, I think it must be for death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For how calm, how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death or life I am then indifferent, my soul declines to prefer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Indeed O death, I think now these leaves mean precisely the same as you mean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see! grow up out of my breast!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spring away from the conceal’d heart there!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do not fold yourself so in your pink-tinged roots timid leaves!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do not remain down there so ashamed, herbage of my breast!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come I am determin’d to unbare this broad breast of mine, I have long enough stifled and choked;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you, now you serve me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will say what I have to say by itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will sound myself and comrades only, I will never again utter a call only their call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and will through the States,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give me your tone therefore O death, that I may accord with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Give me yourself, for I see that you belong to me now above all, and are folded inseparably together, you love and death are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For now it is convey’d to me that you are the purports essential,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you hide in these shifting forms of life, for reasons, and that they are mainly for you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you beyond them come forth to remain, the real reality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait, no matter how long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you will one day perhaps take control of all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may-be you are what it is all for, but it does not last so very long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But you will last very long.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Whoever you are holding me now in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without one thing all will be useless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I give you fair warning before you attempt me further,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am not what you supposed, but far different.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Who is he that would become my follower?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You would have to give up all else, I alone would expect to be your sole and exclusive standard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the lives around you would have to be abandon’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further, let go your hand from my shoulders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put me down and depart on your way.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or else by stealth in some wood for trial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or back of a rock in the open air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For in any roof’d room of a house I emerge not, nor in company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in libraries I lie as one dumb, a gawk, or unborn, or dead,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But just possibly with you on a high hill, first watching lest any person for miles around approach unawares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or possibly with you sailing at sea, or on the beach of the sea or some quiet island,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the comrade’s long-dwelling kiss or the new husband’s kiss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I am the new husband and I am the comrade.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or if you will, thrusting me beneath your clothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Carry me when you go forth over land or sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thus merely touching you is enough, is best,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But these leaves conning you con at peril,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For these leaves and me you will not understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They will elude you at first and still more afterward, I will certainly elude you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me, behold!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already you see I have escaped from you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor will the candidates for my love (unless at most a very few) prove victorious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor will my poems do good only, they will do just as much evil, perhaps more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all is useless without that which you may guess at many times and not hit, that which I hinted at;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore release me and depart on your way.</span>

					<span>(For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And who but I should be the poet of comrades?)</span>

					<span>Now along the pond-side, now wading in a little, fearing not the wet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now by the post-and-rail fences where the old stones thrown there, pick’d from the fields, have accumulated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Wild-flowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones and partly cover them, beyond these I pass,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far, far in the forest, or sauntering later in summer, before I think where I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Solitary, smelling the earthy smell, stopping now and then in the silence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone I had thought, yet soon a troop gathers around me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some walk by my side and some behind, and some embrace my arms or neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive, thicker they come, a great crowd, and I in the middle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Collecting, dispensing, singing, there I wander with them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plucking something for tokens, tossing toward whoever is near me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, lilac, with a branch of pine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, out of my pocket, some moss which I pull’d off a live-oak in Florida as it hung trailing down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here, some pinks and laurel leaves, and a handful of sage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here what I now draw from the water, wading in the pond-side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me, and returns again never to separate from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this, O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades, this calamus-root shall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Interchange it youths with each other! let none render it back!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And stems of currants and plum-blows, and the aromatic cedar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These I compass’d around by a thick cloud of spirits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wandering, point to or touch as I pass, or throw them loosely from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Indicating to each one what he shall have, giving something to each;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what I drew from the water by the pond-side, that I reserve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will give of it, but only to them that love as I myself am capable of loving.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Of the terrible doubt of appearances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the uncertainty after all, that we may be deluded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may-be reliance and hope are but speculations after all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That may-be identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May-be the things I perceive, the animals, plants, men, hills, shining and flowing waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The skies of day and night, colors, densities, forms, may-be these are (as doubtless they are) only apparitions, and the real something has yet to be known,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How often I think neither I know, nor any man knows, aught of them,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May-be seeming to me what they are (as doubtless they indeed but seem) as from my present point of view, and might prove (as of course they would) nought of what they appear, or nought anyhow, from entirely changed points of view;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me these and the like of these are curiously answer’d by my lovers, my dear friends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding me by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the subtle air, the impalpable, the sense that words and reason hold not, surround us and pervade us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom, I am silent, I require nothing further,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identity beyond the grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I walk or sit indifferent, I am satisfied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>I saw in Louisiana a live-oak growing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous leaves of dark green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And its look, rude, unbending, lusty, made me think of myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I wonder’d how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone there without its friend near, for I knew I could not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it, and twined around it a little moss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brought it away, and I have placed it in sight in my room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(For I believe lately I think of little else than of them,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet it remains to me a curious token, it makes me think of manly love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all that, and though the live-oak glistens there in Louisiana solitary in a wide flat space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know very well I could not.</span>

					<span>From the long sustain’d kiss upon the mouth or bosom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk, fainting with excess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From what the divine husband knows, from the work of fatherhood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From exultation, victory and relief, from the bedfellow’s embrace in the night,</span>

					<span>From the cling of the trembling arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the bending curve and the clinch,</span>

					<span>From side by side the pliant coverlet off-throwing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the one so unwilling to have me leave, and me just as unwilling to leave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Yet a moment O tender waiter, and I return,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the hour of shining stars and dropping dews,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the night a moment I emerging flitting out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Celebrate you act divine and you children prepared for,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,</span>

						<br/>
						<span>And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?</span>

						<span>The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The expression of the face balks account,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sprawl and fullness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sundown after work,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trousers and waist-straps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such-like I love⁠—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child,</span>

						<span>And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.</span>

					<p>
						<span>This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.</span>

					<span>A woman waits for me, she contains all, nothing is lacking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet all were lacking if sex were lacking, or if the moisture of the right man were lacking.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sex contains all, bodies, souls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanings, proofs, purities, delicacies, results, promulgations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Songs, commands, health, pride, the maternal mystery, the seminal milk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All hopes, benefactions, bestowals, all the passions, loves, beauties, delights of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the governments, judges, gods, follow’d persons of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These are contain’d in sex as parts of itself and justifications of itself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Without shame the man I like knows and avows the deliciousness of his sex,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without shame the woman I like knows and avows hers.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I will dismiss myself from impassive women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will go stay with her who waits for me, and with those women that are warm-blooded and sufficient for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that they understand me and do not deny me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that they are worthy of me, I will be the robust husband of those women.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They are not one jot less than I am,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are tann’d in the face by shining suns and blowing winds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their flesh has the old divine suppleness and strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They know how to swim, row, ride, wrestle, shoot, run, strike, retreat, advance, resist, defend themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are ultimate in their own right⁠—they are calm, clear, well-possess’d of themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I draw you close to me, you women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot let you go, I would do you good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am for you, and you are for me, not only for our own sake, but for others’ sakes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Envelop’d in you sleep greater heroes and bards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They refuse to awake at the touch of any man but me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It is I, you women, I make my way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am stern, acrid, large, undissuadable, but I love you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not hurt you any more than is necessary for you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pour the stuff to start sons and daughters fit for these States, I press with slow rude muscle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I brace myself effectually, I listen to no entreaties,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I dare not withdraw till I deposit what has so long accumulated within me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Through you I drain the pent-up rivers of myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In you I wrap a thousand onward years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On you I graft the grafts of the best-beloved of me and America,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The drops I distil upon you shall grow fierce and athletic girls, new artists, musicians, and singers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The babes I beget upon you are to beget babes in their turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall demand perfect men and women out of my love-spendings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall expect them to interpenetrate with others, as I and you interpenetrate now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall count on the fruits of the gushing showers of them, as I count on the fruits of the gushing showers I give now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I shall look for loving crops from the birth, life, death, immortality, I plant so lovingly now.</span>

					<span>The hairy wild-bee that murmurs and hankers up and down, that gripes the full-grown lady-flower, curves upon her with amorous firm legs, takes his will of her, and holds himself tremulous and tight till he is satisfied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wet of woods through the early hours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two sleepers at night lying close together as they sleep, one with an arm slanting down across and below the waist of the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smell of apples, aromas from crush’d sage-plant, mint, birch-bark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The boy’s longings, the glow and pressure as he confides to me what he was dreaming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dead leaf whirling its spiral whirl and falling still and content to the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The no-form’d stings that sights, people, objects, sting me with,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hubb’d sting of myself, stinging me as much as it ever can any one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sensitive, orbic, underlapp’d brothers, that only privileged feelers may be intimate where they are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The curious roamer the hand roaming all over the body, the bashful withdrawing of flesh where the fingers soothingly pause and edge themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The limpid liquid within the young man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vex’d corrosion so pensive and so painful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The torment, the irritable tide that will not be at rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The like of the same I feel, the like of the same in others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young man that flushes and flushes, and the young woman that flushes and flushes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young man that wakes deep at night, the hot hand seeking to repress what would master him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mystic amorous night, the strange half-welcome pangs, visions, sweats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The pulse pounding through palms and trembling encircling fingers, the young man all color’d, red, ashamed, angry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The souse upon me of my lover the sea, as I lie willing and naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The merriment of the twin babes that crawl over the grass in the sun, the mother never turning her vigilant eyes from them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The walnut-trunk, the walnut-husks, and the ripening or ripen’d long-round walnuts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The continence of vegetables, birds, animals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The consequent meanness of me should I skulk or find myself indecent, while birds and animals never once skulk or find themselves indecent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The great chastity of paternity, to match the great chastity of maternity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The oath of procreation I have sworn, my Adamic and fresh daughters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greed that eats me day and night with hungry gnaw, till I saturate what shall produce boys to fill my place when I am through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wholesome relief, repose, content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this bunch pluck’d at random from myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It has done its work⁠—I toss it carelessly to fall where it may.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O to be yielded to you whoever you are, and you to be yielded to me in defiance of the world!</span>

					<span>O to return to Paradise! O bashful and feminine!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O to draw you to me, to plant on you for the first time the lips of a determin’d man.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O the puzzle, the thrice-tied knot, the deep and dark pool, all untied and illumin’d!</span>

					<span>To be absolv’d from previous ties and conventions, I from mine and you from yours!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To find a new unthought-of nonchalance with the best of Nature!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the gag remov’d from one’s mouth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To have the feeling to-day or any day I am sufficient as I am.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O something unprov’d! something in a trance!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To escape utterly from others’ anchors and holds!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>To court destruction with taunts, with invitations!</span>

					<span>To ascend, to leap to the heavens of the love indicated to me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To rise thither with my inebriate soul!</span>

					<span>I am with you, you men and women of a generation, or ever so many generations hence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just as you feel when you look on the river and sky, so I felt,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Just as you look on the numberless masts of ships and the thick-stemm’d pipes of steamboats, I look’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I too many and many a time cross’d the river of old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Watched the Twelfth-month sea-gulls, saw them high in the air floating with motionless wings, oscillating their bodies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw how the glistening yellow lit up parts of their bodies and left the rest in strong shadow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw the slow-wheeling circles and the gradual edging toward the south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw the reflection of the summer sky in the water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had my eyes dazzled by the shimmering track of beams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look’d at the fine centrifugal spokes of light round the shape of my head in the sunlit water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look’d on the haze on the hills southward and south-westward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look’d on the vapor as it flew in fleeces tinged with violet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look’d toward the lower bay to notice the vessels arriving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw their approach, saw aboard those that were near me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw the white sails of schooners and sloops, saw the ships at anchor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sailors at work in the rigging or out astride the spars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The round masts, the swinging motion of the hulls, the slender serpentine pennants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The large and small steamers in motion, the pilots in their pilot-houses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The white wake left by the passage, the quick tremulous whirl of the wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flags of all nations, the falling of them at sunset,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The scallop-edged waves in the twilight, the ladled cups, the frolicsome crests and glistening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The stretch afar growing dimmer and dimmer, the gray walls of the granite storehouses by the docks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the river the shadowy group, the big steam-tug closely flank’d on each side by the barges, the hay-boat, the belated lighter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the neighboring shore the fires from the foundry chimneys burning high and glaringly into the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Casting their flicker of black contrasted with wild red and yellow light over the tops of houses, and down into the clefts of streets.</span>

					<span>What is it then between us?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is the count of the scores or hundreds of years between us?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whatever it is, it avails not⁠—distance avails not, and place avails not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too lived, Brooklyn of ample hills was mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too walk’d the streets of Manhattan island, and bathed in the waters around it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too felt the curious abrupt questionings stir within me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the day among crowds of people sometimes they came upon me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In my walks home late at night or as I lay in my bed they came upon me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too had been struck from the float forever held in solution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too had receiv’d identity by my body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I was I knew was of my body, and what I should be I knew I should be of my body.</span>

					<span>It is not upon you alone the dark patches fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dark threw its patches down upon me also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The best I had done seem’d to me blank and suspicious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My great thoughts as I supposed them, were they not in reality meagre?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor is it you alone who know what it is to be evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am he who knew what it was to be evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I too knitted the old knot of contrariety,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blabb’d, blush’d, resented, lied, stole, grudg’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had guile, anger, lust, hot wishes I dared not speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was wayward, vain, greedy, shallow, sly, cowardly, malignant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wolf, the snake, the hog, not wanting in me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cheating look, the frivolous word, the adulterous wish, not wanting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Refusals, hates, postponements, meanness, laziness, none of these wanting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was one with the rest, the days and haps of the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Was call’d by my nighest name by clear loud voices of young men as they saw me approaching or passing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Felt their arms on my neck as I stood, or the negligent leaning of their flesh against me as I sat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw many I loved in the street or ferry-boat or public assembly, yet never told them a word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lived the same life with the rest, the same old laughing, gnawing, sleeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Play’d the part that still looks back on the actor or actress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same old role, the role that is what we make it, as great as we like,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or as small as we like, or both great and small.</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">First O Songs for a Prelude</h3>
				<p>
					<span>First O songs for a prelude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lightly strike on the stretch’d tympanum pride and joy in my city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How she led the rest to arms, how she gave the cue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How at once with lithe limbs unwaiting a moment she sprang,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(O superb! O Manhattan, my own, my peerless!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O strongest you in the hour of danger, in crisis! O truer than steel!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How you sprang⁠—how you threw off the costumes of peace with indifferent hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How your soft opera-music changed, and the drum and fife were heard in their stead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How you led to the war, (that shall serve for our prelude, songs of soldiers,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How Manhattan drum-taps led.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Forty years had I in my city seen soldiers parading,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forty years as a pageant, till unawares the lady of this teeming and turbulent city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sleepless amid her ships, her houses, her incalculable wealth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With her million children around her, suddenly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At dead of night, at news from the south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Incens’d struck with clinch’d hand the pavement.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A shock electric, the night sustain’d it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till with ominous hum our hive at daybreak pour’d out its myriads.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From the houses then and the workshops, and through all the doorways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leapt they tumultuous, and lo! Manhattan arming.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To the drum-taps prompt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The young men falling in and arming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mechanics arming, (the trowel, the jack-plane, the blacksmith’s hammer, tost aside with precipitation,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lawyer leaving his office and arming, the judge leaving the court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The driver deserting his wagon in the street, jumping down, throwing the reins abruptly down on the horses’ backs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The salesman leaving the store, the boss, book-keeper, porter, all leaving;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Squads gather everywhere by common consent and arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The new recruits, even boys, the old men show them how to wear their accoutrements, they buckle the straps carefully,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outdoors arming, indoors arming, the flash of the musket-barrels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The white tents cluster in camps, the arm’d sentries around, the sunrise cannon and again at sunset,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arm’d regiments arrive every day, pass through the city, and embark from the wharves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(How good they look as they tramp down to the river, sweaty, with their guns on their shoulders!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I love them! how I could hug them, with their brown faces and their clothes and knapsacks cover’d with dust!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blood of the city up⁠—arm’d! arm’d! the cry everywhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flags flung out from the steeples of churches and from all the public buildings and stores,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tearful parting, the mother kisses her son, the son kisses his mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Loth is the mother to part, yet not a word does she speak to detain him,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tumultuous escort, the ranks of policemen preceding, clearing the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unpent enthusiasm, the wild cheers of the crowd for their favorites,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The artillery, the silent cannons bright as gold, drawn along, rumble lightly over the stones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Silent cannons, soon to cease your silence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon unlimber’d to begin the red business;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the mutter of preparation, all the determin’d arming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hospital service, the lint, bandages and medicines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The women volunteering for nurses, the work begun for in earnest, no mere parade now;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>War! an arm’d race is advancing! the welcome for battle, no turning away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>War! be it weeks, months, or years, an arm’d race is advancing to welcome it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mannahatta a-march⁠—and it’s O to sing it well!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It’s O for a manly life in the camp.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And the sturdy artillery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The guns bright as gold, the work for giants, to serve well the guns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unlimber them! (no more as the past forty years for salutes for courtesies merely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Put in something now besides powder and wadding.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And you lady of ships, you Mannahatta,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old matron of this proud, friendly, turbulent city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Often in peace and wealth you were pensive or covertly frown’d amid all your children,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now you smile with joy exulting old Mannahatta.</span>

					<span>Arm’d year⁠—year of the struggle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No dainty rhymes or sentimental love verses for you terrible year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not you as some pale poetling seated at a desk lisping cadenzas piano,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as a strong man erect, clothed in blue clothes, advancing, carrying a rifle on your shoulder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With well-gristled body and sunburnt face and hands, with a knife in the belt at your side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I heard you shouting loud, your sonorous voice ringing across the continent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your masculine voice O year, as rising amid the great cities,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid the men of Manhattan I saw you as one of the workmen, the dwellers in Manhattan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or with large steps crossing the prairies out of Illinois and Indiana,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rapidly crossing the West with springy gait and descending the Alleghanies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or down from the great lakes or in Pennsylvania, or on deck along the Ohio river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or southward along the Tennessee or Cumberland rivers, or at Chattanooga on the mountain top,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw I your gait and saw I your sinewy limbs clothed in blue, bearing weapons, robust year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heard your determin’d voice launch’d forth again and again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Year that suddenly sang by the mouths of the round-lipp’d cannon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I repeat you, hurrying, crashing, sad, distracted year.</span>

					<span>Beat! beat! drums!⁠—blow! bugles! blow!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through the windows⁠—through doors⁠—burst like a ruthless force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the solemn church, and scatter the congregation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the school where the scholar is studying;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leave not the bridegroom quiet⁠—no happiness must he have now with his bride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the peaceful farmer any peace, ploughing his field or gathering his grain,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Beat! beat! drums!⁠—blow! bugles! blow!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the traffic of cities⁠—over the rumble of wheels in the streets;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are beds prepared for sleepers at night in the houses? no sleepers must sleep in those beds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No bargainers’ bargains by day⁠—no brokers or speculators⁠—would they continue?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would the talkers be talking? would the singer attempt to sing?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would the lawyer rise in the court to state his case before the judge?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rattle quicker, heavier drums⁠—you bugles wilder blow.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Beat! beat! drums!⁠—blow! bugles! blow!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make no parley⁠—stop for no expostulation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mind not the timid⁠—mind not the weeper or prayer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mind not the old man beseeching the young man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let not the child’s voice be heard, nor the mother’s entreaties,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make even the trestles to shake the dead where they lie awaiting the hearses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So strong you thump O terrible drums⁠—so loud you bugles blow.</span>

					<span>From Paumanok starting I fly like a bird,</span>

					<span>Around and around to soar to sing the idea of all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the north betaking myself to sing there arctic songs,</span>

						<span>I hear and see not strips of cloth alone,</span>

						<span>I hear the tramp of armies, I hear the challenging sentry,</span>

						<span>I hear the jubilant shouts of millions of men, I hear Liberty!</span>

						<br/>
						<span>I myself move abroad swift-rising flying then,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I use the wings of the land-bird and use the wings of the sea-bird, and look down as from a height,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I do not deny the precious results of peace, I see populous cities with wealth incalculable,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see numberless farms, I see the farmers working in their fields or barns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see mechanics working, I see buildings everywhere founded, going up, or finish’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see trains of cars swiftly speeding along railroad tracks drawn by the locomotives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see the stores, depots, of Boston, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see far in the West the immense area of grain, I dwell awhile hovering,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I pass to the lumber forests of the North, and again to the Southern plantation, and again to California;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sweeping the whole I see the countless profit, the busy gatherings, earn’d wages,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>See the Identity formed out of thirty-eight spacious and haughty States, (and many more to come,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>See forts on the shores of harbors, see ships sailing in and out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then over all, (aye! aye!) my little and lengthen’d pennant shaped like a sword,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Runs swiftly up indicating war and defiance⁠—and now the halyards have rais’d it,</span>

						<span>Side of my banner broad and blue, side of my starry banner,</span>

						<span>I ascended the towering rocks along the Pacific, I sail’d out to sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I sail’d through the storm, I was refresh’d by the storm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I watch’d with joy the threatening maws of the waves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I mark’d the white combs where they career’d so high, curling over,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I heard the wind piping, I saw the black clouds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw from below what arose and mounted, (O superb! O wild as my heart, and powerful!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard the continuous thunder as it bellow’d after the lightning,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Noted the slender and jagged threads of lightning as sudden and fast amid the din they chased each other across the sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These, and such as these, I, elate, saw⁠—saw with wonder, yet pensive and masterful,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All the menacing might of the globe uprisen around me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet there with my soul I fed, I fed content, supercilious.</span>

						<span>What, to passions I witness around me to-day? was the sea risen?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was the wind piping the pipe of death under the black clouds?</span>

						<span>Lo! from deeps more unfathomable, something more deadly and savage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Manhattan rising, advancing with menacing front⁠—Cincinnati, Chicago, unchain’d;</span>

						<span>When I clutch’d your hand it was not with terror,</span>

						<span>But suddenly pouring about me here on every side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And below there where the boys were drilling, and up the slopes they ran,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where tents are pitch’d, and wherever you see south and south-east and south-west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Over hills, across lowlands, and in the skirts of woods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And along the shores, in mire (now fill’d over) came again and suddenly raged,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As eighty-five years a-gone no mere parade receiv’d with applause of friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But a battle which I took part in myself⁠—aye, long ago as it is, I took part in it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Walking then this hilltop, this same ground.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Aye, this is the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My blind eyes even as I speak behold it re-peopled from graves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The years recede, pavements and stately houses disappear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rude forts appear again, the old hoop’d guns are mounted,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see the lines of rais’d earth stretching from river to bay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I mark the vista of waters, I mark the uplands and slopes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here we lay encamp’d, it was this time in summer also.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As I talk I remember all, I remember the Declaration,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was read here, the whole army paraded, it was read to us here,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By his staff surrounded the General stood in the middle, he held up his unsheath’d sword,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It glitter’d in the sun in full sight of the army.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas a bold act then⁠—the English war-ships had just arrived,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We could watch down the lower bay where they lay at anchor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the transports swarming with soldiers.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A few days more and they landed, and then the battle.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Twenty thousand were brought against us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A veteran force furnish’d with good artillery.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I tell not now the whole of the battle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But one brigade early in the forenoon order’d forward to engage the red-coats,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that brigade I tell, and how steadily it march’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how long and well it stood confronting death.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Who do you think that was marching steadily sternly confronting death?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rais’d in Virginia and Maryland, and most of them known personally to the General.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Jauntily forward they went with quick step toward Gowanus’ waters,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till of a sudden unlook’d for by defiles through the woods, gain’d at night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The British advancing, rounding in from the east, fiercely playing their guns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That brigade of the youngest was cut off and at the enemy’s mercy.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The General watch’d them from this hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They made repeated desperate attempts to burst their environment,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then drew close together, very compact, their flag flying in the middle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But O from the hills how the cannon were thinning and thinning them!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It sickens me yet, that slaughter!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw the moisture gather in drops on the face of the General.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw how he wrung his hands in anguish.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Meanwhile the British manoeuvr’d to draw us out for a pitch’d battle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But we dared not trust the chances of a pitch’d battle.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>We fought the fight in detachments,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sallying forth we fought at several points, but in each the luck was against us,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our foe advancing, steadily getting the best of it, push’d us back to the works on this hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till we turn’d menacing here, and then he left us.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That was the going out of the brigade of the youngest men, two thousand strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Few return’d, nearly all remain in Brooklyn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That and here my General’s first battle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No women looking on nor sunshine to bask in, it did not conclude with applause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nobody clapp’d hands here then.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But in darkness in mist on the ground under a chill rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wearied that night we lay foil’d and sullen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While scornfully laugh’d many an arrogant lord off against us encamp’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quite within hearing, feasting, clinking wineglasses together over their victory.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So dull and damp and another day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But the night of that, mist lifting, rain ceasing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Silent as a ghost while they thought they were sure of him, my General retreated.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I saw him at the river-side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down by the ferry lit by torches, hastening the embarcation;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My General waited till the soldiers and wounded were all pass’d over,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then, (it was just ere sunrise,) these eyes rested on him for the last time.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Every one else seem’d fill’d with gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Many no doubt thought of capitulation.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when my General pass’d me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he stood in his boat and look’d toward the coming sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw something different from capitulation.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Lo, ’tis autumn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, where the trees, deeper green, yellower and redder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cool and sweeten Ohio’s villages with leaves fluttering in the moderate wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where apples ripe in the orchards hang and grapes on the trellis’d vines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Smell you the smell of the grapes on the vines?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smell you the buckwheat where the bees were lately buzzing?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Above all, lo, the sky so calm, so transparent after the rain, and with wondrous clouds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below too, all calm, all vital and beautiful, and the farm prospers well.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Down in the fields all prospers well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now from the fields come father, come at the daughter’s call,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And come to the entry mother, to the front door come right away.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fast as she can she hurries, something ominous, her steps trembling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She does not tarry to smooth her hair nor adjust her cap.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Open the envelope quickly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O this is not our son’s writing, yet his name is sign’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O a strange hand writes for our dear son, O stricken mother’s soul!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All swims before her eyes, flashes with black, she catches the main words only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sentences broken, <q>gunshot wound in the breast, cavalry skirmish, taken to hospital,</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>At present low, but will soon be better.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ah now the single figure to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid all teeming and wealthy Ohio with all its cities and farms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sickly white in the face and dull in the head, very faint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the jamb of a door leans.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span><q>Grieve not so, dear mother,</q> (the just-grown daughter speaks through her sobs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The little sisters huddle around speechless and dismay’d,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>See, dearest mother, the letter says Pete will soon be better.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Alas poor boy, he will never be better, (nor may-be needs to be better, that brave and simple soul,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While they stand at home at the door he is dead already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The only son is dead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But the mother needs to be better,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She with thin form presently drest in black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By day her meals untouch’d, then at night fitfully sleeping, often waking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the midnight waking, weeping, longing with one deep longing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O that she might withdraw unnoticed, silent from life escape and withdraw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To follow, to seek, to be with her dear dead son.</span>

					<span>Vigil strange I kept on the field one night;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When you my son and my comrade dropt at my side that day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One look I but gave which your dear eyes return’d with a look I shall never forget,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One touch of your hand to mine O boy, reach’d up as you lay on the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then onward I sped in the battle, the even-contested battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till late in the night reliev’d to the place at last again I made my way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Found you in death so cold dear comrade, found your body son of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bared your face in the starlight, curious the scene, cool blew the moderate night-wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long there and then in vigil I stood, dimly around me the battlefield spreading,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vigil wondrous and vigil sweet there in the fragrant silent night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not a tear fell, not even a long-drawn sigh, long, long I gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then on the earth partially reclining sat by your side leaning my chin in my hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Passing sweet hours, immortal and mystic hours with you dearest comrade⁠—not a tear, not a word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vigil of silence, love and death, vigil for you my son and my soldier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As onward silently stars aloft, eastward new ones upward stole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vigil final for you brave boy, (I could not save you, swift was your death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I faithfully loved you and cared for you living, I think we shall surely meet again,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till at latest lingering of the night, indeed just as the dawn appear’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My comrade I wrapt in his blanket, envelop’d well his form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Folded the blanket well, tucking it carefully over head and carefully under feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there and then and bathed by the rising sun, my son in his grave, in his rude-dug grave I deposited,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ending my vigil strange with that, vigil of night and battle-field dim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vigil for boy of responding kisses, (never again on earth responding,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vigil for comrade swiftly slain, vigil I never forget, how as day brighten’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I rose from the chill ground and folded my soldier well in his blanket,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And buried him where he fell.</span>

				<p>
					<span>A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our army foil’d with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospital,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster’s face is white as a lily,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o’er the scene fain to absorb it all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the odor of blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm sweating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An occasional scream or cry, the doctor’s shouted orders or calls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then hear outside the orders given, <q>Fall in, my men, fall in;</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unknown road still marching.</span>

					<span>While my wife at my side lies slumbering, and the wars are over long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my head on the pillow rests at home, and the vacant midnight passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the stillness, through the dark, I hear, just hear, the breath of my infant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There in the room as I wake from sleep this vision presses upon me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The engagement opens there and then in fantasy unreal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The skirmishers begin, they crawl cautiously ahead, I hear the irregular snap! snap!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the sounds of the different missiles, the short <q>t-h-t! t-h-t!</q> of the rifle-balls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the shells exploding leaving small white clouds, I hear the great shells shrieking as they pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The grape like the hum and whirr of wind through the trees, (tumultuous now the contest rages,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the scenes at the batteries rise in detail before me again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The crashing and smoking, the pride of the men in their pieces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chief-gunner ranges and sights his piece and selects a fuse of the right time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After firing I see him lean aside and look eagerly off to note the effect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Elsewhere I hear the cry of a regiment charging, (the young colonel leads himself this time with brandish’d sword,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the gaps cut by the enemy’s volleys, (quickly fill’d up, no delay,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I breathe the suffocating smoke, then the flat clouds hover low concealing all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now a strange lull for a few seconds, not a shot fired on either side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then resumed the chaos louder than ever, with eager calls and orders of officers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While from some distant part of the field the wind wafts to my ears a shout of applause, (some special success,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever the sound of the cannon far or near, (rousing even in dreams a devilish exultation and all the old mad joy in the depths of my soul,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ever the hastening of infantry shifting positions, batteries, cavalry, moving hither and thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The falling, dying, I heed not, the wounded dripping and red I heed not, some to the rear are hobbling,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grime, heat, rush, aides-de-camp galloping by or on a full run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the patter of small arms, the warning <q>s-s-t</q> of the rifles, (these in my vision I hear or see,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And bombs bursting in air, and at night the vari-color’d rockets.</span>

					<p>Behind a Goodbye there lurks much of the salutation of another beginning⁠—to me, Development, Continuity, Immortality, Transformation, are the chiefest life-meanings of Nature and Humanity, and are the sine qua non of all facts, and each fact.</p>
					<p>Why do folks dwell so fondly on the last words, advice, appearance, of the departing? Those last words are not samples of the best, which involve vitality at its full, and balance, and perfect control and scope. But they are valuable beyond measure to confirm and endorse the varied train, facts, theories and faith of the whole preceding life. <a href="goodbye-my-fancy.xhtml#noteref-3" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><b>Note.</b>⁠—<i>Summer country life.⁠—Several years.</i>⁠—In my rambles and explorations I found a woody place near the creek, where for some reason the birds in happy mood seem’d to resort in unusual numbers. Especially at the beginning of the day, and again at the ending, I was sure to get there the most copious bird-concerts. I repair’d there frequently at sunrise⁠—and also at sunset, or just before.⁠ ⁠… Once the question arose in me: Which is the best singing, the first or the lattermost? The first always exhilarated, and perhaps seem’d more joyous and stronger; but I always felt the sunset or late afternoon sounds more penetrating and sweeter⁠—seem’d to touch the soul⁠—often the evening thrushes, two or three of them, responding and perhaps blending. Though I miss’d some of the mornings, I found myself getting to be quite strictly punctual at the evening utterances.</p>
					<p><b>Another Note.</b>⁠—“He went out with the tide and the sunset,” was a phrase I heard from a surgeon describing an old sailor’s death under peculiarly gentle conditions.</p>
					<p>During the Secession War, 1863 and ’4, visitng the Army Hospitals around Washington, I form’d the habit, and continued it to the end, whenever the ebb or flood tide began the latter part of the day, of punctually visiting those at that time populous wards of suffering men. Somehow (or I thought so) the effect of the hour was palpable. The badly wounded would get some ease, and would like to talk a little, or be talk’d to. Intellectual and emotional natures would be at their best: Deaths were always easier; medicines seem’d to have better effect when given then, and a lulling atmosphere would pervade the wards.</p>
					<p>Similar influences, similar circumstances and hours, day-close, after great battles, even with all their horrors. I had more than once the same experience on the fields cover’d with fallen or dead. <a href="goodbye-my-fancy.xhtml#noteref-4" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>“In the grand constellation of five or six names, under Lincoln’s Presidency, that history will bear for ages in her firmament as marking the last life-throbs of secession, and beaming on its dying gasps, Sheridan’s will be bright. One consideration rising out of the now dead soldier’s example as it passes my mind, is worth taking notice of. If the war had continued any long time these States, in my opinion, would have shown and proved the most conclusive military talents ever evinced by any nation on earth. That they possess’d a rank and file ahead of all other known in points of quality and limitlessness of number are easily admitted. But we have, too, the eligibility of organizing, handling and officering equal to the other. These two, with modern arms, transportation, and inventive American genius, would make the United States, with earnestness, not only able to stand the whole world, but conquer that world united against us.” <a href="goodbye-my-fancy.xhtml#noteref-5" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>
						<span>This face is a haze more chill than the arctic sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its sleepy and wabbling icebergs crunch as they go.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This is a face of bitter herbs, this an emetic, they need no label,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more of the drug-shelf, laudanum, caoutchouc, or hog’s-lard.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is an epilepsy, its wordless tongue gives out the unearthly cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its veins down the neck distend, its eyes roll till they show nothing but their whites,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its teeth grit, the palms of the hands are cut by the turn’d-in nails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man falls struggling and foaming to the ground, while he speculates well.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>This face is bitten by vermin and worms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this is some murderer’s knife with a half-pull’d scabbard.</span>

					<h3 epub:type="title">Preface Note to 2nd Annex</h3>
					<p epub:type="bridgehead">Concluding <abbr>L.</abbr> of <abbr>G.</abbr>⁠—1891</p>
				</header>
				<p>Had I not better withhold (in this old age and paralysis of me) such little tags and fringe-dots (maybe specks, stains,) as follow a long dusty journey, and witness it afterward? I have probably not been enough afraid of careless touches, from the first⁠—and am not now⁠—nor of parrot-like repetitions⁠—nor platitudes and the commonplace. Perhaps I am too democratic for such avoidances. Besides, is not the verse-field, as originally plann’d by my theory, now sufficiently illustrated⁠—and full time for me to silently retire?⁠—(indeed amid no loud call or market for my sort of poetic utterance).</p>
				<p>In answer, or rather defiance, to that kind of well-put interrogation, here comes this little cluster, and conclusion of my preceding clusters. Though not at all clear that, as here collated, it is worth printing (certainly I have nothing fresh to write)⁠—I while away the hours of my 72nd year⁠—hours of forced confinement in my den⁠—by putting in shape this small old age collation:</p>
				<blockquote epub:type="z3998:verse">
					<p>
						<span>Last droplets of and after spontaneous rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From many limpid distillations and past showers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Will they germinate anything? mere exhalations as they all are⁠—the land’s and sea’s⁠—America’s;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will they filter to any deep emotion? any heart and brain?)</span>
					</p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>However that may be, I feel like improving today’s opportunity and wind up. During the last two years I have sent out, in the lulls of illness and exhaustion, certain chirps⁠—lingering-dying ones probably (undoubtedly)⁠—which now I may as well gather and put in fair type while able to see correctly⁠—(for my eyes plainly warn me they are dimming, and my brain more and more palpably neglects or refuses, month after month, even slight tasks or revisions).</p>
				<p>In fact, here I am these current years 1890 and ’91, (each successive fortnight getting stiffer and stuck deeper) much like some hard-cased dilapidated grim ancient shellfish or time-bang’d conch (no legs, utterly non-locomotive) cast up high and dry on the shore-sands, helpless to move anywhere⁠—nothing left but behave myself quiet, and while away the days yet assign’d, and discover if there is anything for the said grim and time-bang’d conch to be got at last out of inherited good spirits and primal buoyant centre-pulses down there deep somewhere within his gray-blurr’d old shell.⁠ ⁠… (Reader, you must allow a little fun here⁠—for one reason there are too many of the following poemets about death, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, and for another the passing hours (July 5, 1890) are so sunny-fine. And old as I am I feel today almost a part of some frolicsome wave, or for sporting yet like a kid or kitten⁠—probably a streak of physical adjustment and perfection here and now. I believe I have it in me perennially anyhow.)</p>
				<hr/>
				<p>Then behind all, the deep-down consolation (it is a glum one, but I dare not be sorry for the fact of it in the past, nor refrain from dwelling, even vaunting here at the end) that this late-years palsied old shorn and shellfish condition of me is the indubitable outcome and growth, now near for 20 years along, of too overzealous, over-continued bodily and emotional excitement and action through the times of 1862, ’3, ’4 and ’5, visiting and waiting on wounded and sick army volunteers, both sides, in campaigns or contests, or after them, or in hospitals or fields south of Washington City, or in that place and elsewhere⁠—those hot, sad, wrenching times⁠—the army volunteers, all States⁠—or North or South⁠—the wounded, suffering, dying⁠—the exhausting, sweating summers, marches, battles, carnage⁠—those trenches hurriedly heap’d by the corpse-thousands, mainly unknown⁠—Will the America of the future⁠—will this vast rich Union ever realize what itself cost, back there after all?⁠—those hecatombs of battle-deaths⁠—Those times of which, O far-off reader, this whole book is indeed finally but a reminiscent memorial from thence by me to you?</p>

						<span>In the heavenly aerial beauty, (after the perturb’d winds and the storms,)</span>

						<span>Under the arching heavens of the afternoon swift passing, and the voices of children and women,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The many-moving sea-tides, and I saw the ships how they sail’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the summer approaching with richness, and the fields all busy with labor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the infinite separate houses, how they all went on, each with its meals and minutia of daily usages,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the streets how their throbbings throbb’d, and the cities pent⁠—lo, then and there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Falling upon them all and among them all, enveloping me with the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Appear’d the cloud, appear’d the long black trail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I knew death, its thought, and the sacred knowledge of death.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then with the knowledge of death as walking one side of me,</span>

						<span>And the thought of death close-walking the other side of me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I in the middle as with companions, and as holding the hands of companions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I fled forth to the hiding receiving night that talks not,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down to the shores of the water, the path by the swamp in the dimness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To the solemn shadowy cedars and ghostly pines so still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And the singer so shy to the rest receiv’d me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gray-brown bird I know receiv’d us comrades three,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he sang the carol of death, and a verse for him I love.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>From deep secluded recesses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From the fragrant cedars and the ghostly pines so still,</span>
						<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Your self-distilling, never-ceasing virtues, self-denials, graces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your endless base of deep integrities within, timid but certain,</span>

					<span>Your blessings steadily bestow’d, sure as the light, and still,</span>

					<span>Here enter lists with thee, claiming my right to make a symbol too.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I have seen many wounded soldiers die,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nor celebrate the struggle, or contortion, or hard-tied knot),</span>

					<span>A phantom of the moment, mystic, stalking, sudden,</span>

			<p>
				<span>Always our old feuillage!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always Florida’s green peninsula⁠—always the priceless delta of Louisiana⁠—always the cotton-fields of Alabama and Texas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always California’s golden hills and hollows, and the silver mountains of New Mexico⁠—always soft-breath’d Cuba,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always the vast slope drain’d by the Southern sea, inseparable with the slopes drain’d by the Eastern and Western seas,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The area the eighty-third year of these States, the three and a half millions of square miles,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The eighteen thousand miles of sea-coast and bay-coast on the main, the thirty thousand miles of river navigation,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The seven millions of distinct families and the same number of dwellings⁠—always these, and more, branching forth into numberless branches,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always the free range and diversity⁠—always the continent of Democracy;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always the prairies, pastures, forests, vast cities, travelers, Kanada, the snows;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always these compact lands tied at the hips with the belt stringing the huge oval lakes;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Always the West with strong native persons, the increasing density there, the habitans, friendly, threatening, ironical, scorning invaders;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All sights, South, North, East⁠—all deeds, promiscuously done at all times,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All characters, movements, growths, a few noticed, myriads unnoticed,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Through Mannahatta’s streets I walking, these things gathering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On interior rivers by night in the glare of pine knots, steamboats wooding up,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sunlight by day on the valley of the Susquehanna, and on the valleys of the Potomac and Rappahannock, and the valleys of the Roanoke and Delaware,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In their northerly wilds beasts of prey haunting the Adirondacks the hills, or lapping the Saginaw waters to drink,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In a lonesome inlet a sheldrake lost from the flock, sitting on the water rocking silently,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In farmers’ barns oxen in the stable, their harvest labor done, they rest standing, they are too tired,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Afar on arctic ice the she-walrus lying drowsily while her cubs play around,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The hawk sailing where men have not yet sail’d, the farthest polar sea, ripply, crystalline, open, beyond the floes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>White drift spooning ahead where the ship in the tempest dashes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On solid land what is done in cities as the bells strike midnight together,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In primitive woods the sounds there also sounding, the howl of the wolf, the scream of the panther, and the hoarse bellow of the elk,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In winter beneath the hard blue ice of Moosehead lake, in summer visible through the clear waters, the great trout swimming,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In lower latitudes in warmer air in the Carolinas the large black buzzard floating slowly high beyond the tree tops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Below, the red cedar festoon’d with tylandria, the pines and cypresses growing out of the white sand that spreads far and flat,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Rude boats descending the big Pedee, climbing plants, parasites with color’d flowers and berries enveloping huge trees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The waving drapery on the live-oak trailing long and low, noiselessly waved by the wind,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The camp of Georgia wagoners just after dark, the supper-fires and the cooking and eating by whites and negroes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thirty or forty great wagons, the mules, cattle, horses, feeding from troughs,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The shadows, gleams, up under the leaves of the old sycamore-trees, the flames with the black smoke from the pitch-pine curling and rising;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Southern fishermen fishing, the sounds and inlets of North Carolina’s coast, the shad-fishery and the herring-fishery, the large sweep-seines, the windlasses on shore work’d by horses, the clearing, curing, and packing-houses;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Deep in the forest in piney woods turpentine dropping from the incisions in the trees, there are the turpentine works,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are the negroes at work in good health, the ground in all directions is cover’d with pine straw;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Tennessee and Kentucky slaves busy in the coalings, at the forge, by the furnace-blaze, or at the corn-shucking,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Virginia, the planter’s son returning after a long absence, joyfully welcom’d and kiss’d by the aged mulatto nurse,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>On rivers boatmen safely moor’d at nightfall in their boats under shelter of high banks,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Some of the younger men dance to the sound of the banjo or fiddle, others sit on the gunwale smoking and talking;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Late in the afternoon the mocking-bird, the American mimic, singing in the Great Dismal Swamp,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>There are the greenish waters, the resinous odor, the plenteous moss, the cypress-tree, and the juniper-tree;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Northward, young men of Mannahatta, the target company from an excursion returning home at evening, the musket-muzzles all bear bunches of flowers presented by women;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Children at play, or on his father’s lap a young boy fallen asleep, (how his lips move! how he smiles in his sleep!)</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The scout riding on horseback over the plains west of the Mississippi, he ascends a knoll and sweeps his eyes around;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>California life, the miner, bearded, dress’d in his rude costume, the stanch California friendship, the sweet air, the graves one in passing meets solitary just aside the horse-path;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Down in Texas the cotton-field, the negro-cabins, drivers driving mules or oxen before rude carts, cotton bales piled on banks and wharves;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Encircling all, vast-darting up and wide, the American Soul, with equal hemispheres, one Love, one Dilation or Pride;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In arrière the peace-talk with the Iroquois the aborigines, the calumet, the pipe of good-will, arbitration, and endorsement,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The sachem blowing the smoke first toward the sun and then toward the earth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The drama of the scalp-dance enacted with painted faces and guttural exclamations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The setting out of the war-party, the long and stealthy march,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The single file, the swinging hatchets, the surprise and slaughter of enemies;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All the acts, scenes, ways, persons, attitudes of these States, reminiscences, institutions,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>All these States compact, every square mile of these States without excepting a particle;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Me pleas’d, rambling in lanes and country fields, Paumanok’s fields,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Observing the spiral flight of two little yellow butterflies shuffling between each other, ascending high in the air,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The darting swallow, the destroyer of insects, the fall traveler southward but returning northward early in the spring,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The country boy at the close of the day driving the herd of cows and shouting to them as they loiter to browse by the roadside,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The city wharf, Boston, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, New Orleans, San Francisco,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The departing ships when the sailors heave at the capstan;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Evening⁠—me in my room⁠—the setting sun,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The setting summer sun shining in my open window, showing the swarm of flies, suspended, balancing in the air in the centre of the room, darting athwart, up and down, casting swift shadows in specks on the opposite wall where the shine is;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The athletic American matron speaking in public to crowds of listeners,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Males, females, immigrants, combinations, the copiousness, the individuality of the States, each for itself⁠—the money-makers,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Factories, machinery, the mechanical forces, the windlass, lever, pulley, all certainties,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The certainty of space, increase, freedom, futurity,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In space the sporades, the scatter’d islands, the stars⁠—on the firm earth, the lands, my lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>O lands! all so dear to me⁠—what you are, (whatever it is,) I putting it at random in these songs, become a part of that, whatever it is,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Southward there, I screaming, with wings slow flapping, with the myriads of gulls wintering along the coasts of Florida,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Otherways there atwixt the banks of the Arkansaw, the Rio Grande, the Nueces, the Brazos, the Tombigbee, the Red River, the Saskatchawan or the Osage, I with the spring waters laughing and skipping and running,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Northward, on the sands, on some shallow bay of Paumanok, I with parties of snowy herons wading in the wet to seek worms and aquatic plants,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Retreating, triumphantly twittering, the king-bird, from piercing the crow with its bill, for amusement⁠—and I triumphantly twittering,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The migrating flock of wild geese alighting in autumn to refresh themselves, the body of the flock feed, the sentinels outside move around with erect heads watching, and are from time to time reliev’d by other sentinels⁠—and I feeding and taking turns with the rest,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In Kanadian forests the moose, large as an ox, corner’d by hunters, rising desperately on his hind-feet, and plunging with his fore-feet, the hoofs as sharp as knives⁠—and I, plunging at the hunters, corner’d and desperate,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In the Mannahatta, streets, piers, shipping, store-houses, and the countless workmen working in the shops,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And I too of the Mannahatta, singing thereof⁠—and no less in myself than the whole of the Mannahatta in itself,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Singing the song of These, my ever-united lands⁠—my body no more inevitably united, part to part, and made out of a thousand diverse contributions one identity, any more than my lands are inevitably united and made <b>One identity</b>;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Nativities, climates, the grass of the great pastoral Plains,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Cities, labors, death, animals, products, war, good and evil⁠—these me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These affording, in all their particulars, the old feuillage to me and to America, how can I do less than pass the clew of the union of them, to afford the like to you?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Whoever you are! how can I but offer you divine leaves, that you also be eligible as I am?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>How can I but as here chanting, invite you for yourself to collect bouquets of the incomparable feuillage of these States?</span>

					<span>I see over my own continent the Pacific railroad surmounting every barrier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see continual trains of cars winding along the Platte carrying freight and passengers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the locomotives rushing and roaring, and the shrill steam-whistle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the echoes reverberate through the grandest scenery in the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cross the Laramie plains, I note the rocks in grotesque shapes, the buttes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the plentiful larkspur and wild onions, the barren, colorless, sage-deserts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see in glimpses afar or towering immediately above me the great mountains, I see the Wind river and the Wahsatch mountains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the Monument mountain and the Eagle’s Nest, I pass the Promontory, I ascend the Nevadas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I scan the noble Elk mountain and wind around its base,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the Humboldt range, I thread the valley and cross the river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the clear waters of lake Tahoe, I see forests of majestic pines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or crossing the great desert, the alkaline plains, I behold enchanting mirages of waters and meadows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marking through these and after all, in duplicate slender lines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bridging the three or four thousand miles of land travel,</span>

			<p>
				<span>A batter’d, wreck’d old man,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thrown on this savage shore, far, far from home,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Pent by the sea and dark rebellious brows, twelve dreary months,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sore, stiff with many toils, sicken’d and nigh to death,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I take my way along the island’s edge,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Venting a heavy heart.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>I am too full of woe!</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haply I may not live another day;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I cannot rest O God, I cannot eat or drink or sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Till I put forth myself, my prayer, once more to Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Breathe, bathe myself once more in Thee, commune with Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Report myself once more to Thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Thou knowest my years entire, my life,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My long and crowded life of active work, not adoration merely;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest the prayers and vigils of my youth,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest my manhood’s solemn and visionary meditations,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest how before I commenced I devoted all to come to Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest I have in age ratified all those vows and strictly kept them,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thou knowest I have not once lost nor faith nor ecstasy in Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>In shackles, prison’d, in disgrace, repining not,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Accepting all from Thee, as duly come from Thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>All my emprises have been fill’d with Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My speculations, plans, begun and carried on in thoughts of Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Sailing the deep or journeying the land for Thee;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Intentions, purports, aspirations mine, leaving results to Thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>O I am sure they really came from Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The urge, the ardor, the unconquerable will,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The potent, felt, interior command, stronger than words,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>A message from the Heavens whispering to me even in sleep,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>These sped me on.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>By me and these the work so far accomplish’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By me earth’s elder cloy’d and stifled lands uncloy’d, unloos’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>By me the hemispheres rounded and tied, the unknown to the known.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>The end I know not, it is all in Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Or small or great I know not⁠—haply what broad fields, what lands,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haply the brutish measureless human undergrowth I know,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Transplanted there may rise to stature, knowledge worthy Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haply the swords I know may there indeed be turn’d to reaping-tools,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Haply the lifeless cross I know, Europe’s dead cross, may bud and blossom there.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>One effort more, my altar this bleak sand;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>That Thou O God my life hast lighted,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>With ray of light, steady, ineffable, vouchsafed of Thee,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Light rare untellable, lighting the very light,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Beyond all signs, descriptions, languages;</span>
				<br/>
				<span>For that O God, be it my latest word, here on my knees,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Old, poor, and paralyzed, I thank Thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My terminus near,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The clouds already closing in upon me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>The voyage balk’d, the course disputed, lost,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I yield my ships to Thee.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>My hands, my limbs grow nerveless,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>My brain feels rack’d, bewilder’d,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Let the old timbers part, I will not part,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I will cling fast to Thee, O God, though the waves buffet me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Thee, Thee at least I know.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>Is it the prophet’s thought I speak, or am I raving?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>What do I know of life? what of myself?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>I know not even my own work past or present,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Dim ever-shifting guesses of it spread before me,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Of newer better worlds, their mighty parturition,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Mocking, perplexing me.</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				<span>And these things I see suddenly, what mean they?</span>
				<br/>
				<span>As if some miracle, some hand divine unseal’d my eyes,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>Shadowy vast shapes smile through the air and sky,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And on the distant waves sail countless ships,</span>
				<br/>
				<span>And anthems in new tongues I hear saluting me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Proud music of the storm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blast that careers so free, whistling across the prairies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strong hum of forest tree-tops⁠—wind of the mountains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Personified dim shapes⁠—you hidden orchestras,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You serenades of phantoms with instruments alert,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blending with Nature’s rhythmus all the tongues of nations;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You chords left as by vast composers⁠—you choruses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You formless, free, religious dances⁠—you from the Orient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You undertone of rivers, roar of pouring cataracts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You sounds from distant guns with galloping cavalry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Echoes of camps with all the different bugle-calls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Trooping tumultuous, filling the midnight late, bending me powerless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Entering my lonesome slumber-chamber, why have you seiz’d me?</span>
				</p>

				<p>
					<span>Come forward O my soul, and let the rest retire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listen, lose not, it is toward thee they tend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Parting the midnight, entering my slumber-chamber,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thee they sing and dance O soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A festival song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The duet of the bridegroom and the bride, a marriage-march,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With lips of love, and hearts of lovers fill’d to the brim with love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The red-flush’d cheeks and perfumes, the cortege swarming full of friendly faces young and old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To flutes’ clear notes and sounding harps’ cantabile.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now loud approaching drums,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Victoria! see’st thou in powder-smoke the banners torn but flying? the rout of the baffled?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearest those shouts of a conquering army?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Ah soul, the sobs of women, the wounded groaning in agony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hiss and crackle of flames, the blacken’d ruins, the embers of cities,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dirge and desolation of mankind.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now airs antique and medieval fill me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see and hear old harpers with their harps at Welsh festivals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the minnesingers singing their lays of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the minstrels, gleemen, troubadours, of the middle ages.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now the great organ sounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tremulous, while underneath, (as the hid footholds of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which arising rest, and leaping forth depend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All shapes of beauty, grace and strength, all hues we know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Green blades of grass and warbling birds, children that gambol and play, the clouds of heaven above,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strong base stands, and its pulsations intermits not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bathing, supporting, merging all the rest, maternity of all the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with it every instrument in multitudes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The players playing, all the world’s musicians,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The solemn hymns and masses rousing adoration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All passionate heart-chants, sorrowful appeals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The measureless sweet vocalists of ages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for their solvent setting earth’s own diapason,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of winds and woods and mighty ocean waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A new composite orchestra, binder of years and climes, ten-fold renewer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As of the far-back days the poets tell, the Paradiso,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The straying thence, the separation long, but now the wandering done,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The journey done, the journeyman come home,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And man and art with Nature fused again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tutti! for earth and heaven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The Almighty leader now for once has signal’d with his wand.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The manly strophe of the husbands of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the wives responding.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The tongues of violins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I think O tongues ye tell this heart, that cannot tell itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This brooding yearning heart, that cannot tell itself.)</span>

					<span>Ah from a little child,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou knowest soul how to me all sounds became music,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mother’s voice in lullaby or hymn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The voice, O tender voices, memory’s loving voices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Last miracle of all, O dearest mother’s, sister’s, voices;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rain, the growing corn, the breeze among the long-leav’d corn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The measur’d sea-surf beating on the sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The twittering bird, the hawk’s sharp scream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wild-fowl’s notes at night as flying low migrating north or south,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The psalm in the country church or mid the clustering trees, the open air camp-meeting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fiddler in the tavern, the glee, the long-strung sailor-song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lowing cattle, bleating sheep, the crowing cock at dawn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All songs of current lands come sounding round me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The German airs of friendship, wine and love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Irish ballads, merry jigs and dances, English warbles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chansons of France, Scotch tunes, and o’er the rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Italia’s peerless compositions.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Across the stage with pallor on her face, yet lurid passion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Stalks Norma brandishing the dagger in her hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I see poor crazed Lucia’s eyes’ unnatural gleam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her hair down her back falls loose and dishevel’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I see where Ernani walking the bridal garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amid the scent of night-roses, radiant, holding his bride by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hears the infernal call, the death-pledge of the horn.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To crossing swords and gray hairs bared to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The clear electric base and baritone of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The trombone duo, Libertad forever!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>From Spanish chestnut trees’ dense shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By old and heavy convent walls a wailing song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Song of lost love, the torch of youth and life quench’d in despair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Song of the dying swan, Fernando’s heart is breaking.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Awaking from her woes at last retriev’d Amina sings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Copious as stars and glad as morning light the torrents of her joy.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(The teeming lady comes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lustrous orb, Venus contralto, the blooming mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sister of loftiest gods, Alboni’s self I hear.)</span>

					<span>I hear those odes, symphonies, operas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear in the <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">William Tell</i> the music of an arous’d and angry people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear Meyerbeer’s <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">Huguenots</i>, the <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">Prophet</i>, or <i epub:type="se:name.music.opera">Robert</i>,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear the dance-music of all nations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The waltz, some delicious measure, lapsing, bathing me in bliss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bolero to tinkling guitars and clattering castanets.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I see religious dances old and new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the sound of the Hebrew lyre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the crusaders marching bearing the cross on high, to the martial clang of cymbals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear dervishes monotonously chanting, interspers’d with frantic shouts, as they spin around turning always towards Mecca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the rapt religious dances of the Persians and the Arabs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again, at Eleusis, home of Ceres, I see the modern Greeks dancing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear them clapping their hands as they bend their bodies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the metrical shuffling of their feet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I see again the wild old Corybantian dance, the performers wounding each other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the Roman youth to the shrill sound of flageolets throwing and catching their weapons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As they fall on their knees and rise again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear from the Mussulman mosque the muezzin calling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the worshippers within, nor form nor sermon, argument nor word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But silent, strange, devout, rais’d, glowing heads, ecstatic faces.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear the Egyptian harp of many strings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The primitive chants of the Nile boatmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sacred imperial hymns of China,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the delicate sounds of the king, (the stricken wood and stone,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or to Hindu flutes and the fretting twang of the vina,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A band of bayaderes.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now Asia, Africa leave me, Europe seizing inflates me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To organs huge and bands I hear as from vast concourses of voices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Luther’s strong hymn <i epub:type="se:name.music" xml:lang="de">Ein’ feste Burg ist unser Gott</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rossini’s <i epub:type="se:name.music" xml:lang="la">Stabat Mater dolorosa</i>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or floating in some high cathedral dim with gorgeous color’d windows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The passionate <i epub:type="se:name.music" xml:lang="la">Agnus Dei</i> or <i epub:type="se:name.music" xml:lang="la">Gloria in Excelsis</i>.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Composers! mighty maestros!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you, sweet singers of old lands, soprani, tenori, bassi!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To you a new bard caroling in the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obeisant sends his love.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Such led to thee O soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All senses, shows and objects, lead to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now it seems to me sound leads o’er all the rest.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear the annual singing of the children in <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul’s cathedral,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or, under the high roof of some colossal hall, the symphonies, oratorios of Beethoven, Handel, or Haydn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The <i epub:type="se:name.music">Creation</i> in billows of godhood laves me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Then I woke softly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And pausing, questioning awhile the music of my dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And questioning all those reminiscences, the tempest in its fury,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the songs of sopranos and tenors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those rapt oriental dances of religious fervor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the sweet varied instruments, and the diapason of organs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the artless plaints of love and grief and death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I said to my silent curious soul out of the bed of the slumber-chamber,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come, for I have found the clue I sought so long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us go forth refresh’d amid the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cheerfully tallying life, walking the world, the real,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nourish’d henceforth by our celestial dream.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And I said, moreover,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Haply what thou hast heard O soul was not the sound of winds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor dream of raging storm, nor sea-hawk’s flapping wings nor harsh scream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor vocalism of sun-bright Italy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor German organ majestic, nor vast concourse of voices, nor layers of harmonies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor strophes of husbands and wives, nor sound of marching soldiers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor flutes, nor harps, nor the bugle-calls of camps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to a new rhythmus fitted for thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Poems bridging the way from Life to Death, vaguely wafted in night air, uncaught, unwritten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which let us go forth in the bold day and write.</span>

					<span>Something to eke out a minute additional⁠—shadows of nightfall deepening,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farewells, messages lessening⁠—dimmer the forthgoer’s visage and form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon to be lost for aye in the darkness⁠—loth, O so loth to depart!</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Out of the cradle endlessly rocking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the mocking-bird’s throat, the musical shuttle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the Ninth-month midnight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the sterile sands and the fields beyond, where the child leaving his bed wander’d alone, bareheaded, barefoot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down from the shower’d halo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up from the mystic play of shadows twining and twisting as if they were alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out from the patches of briers and blackberries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the memories of the bird that chanted to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From your memories sad brother, from the fitful risings and fallings I heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From under that yellow half-moon late-risen and swollen as if with tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From those beginning notes of yearning and love there in the mist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the thousand responses of my heart never to cease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the myriad thence-arous’d words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the word stronger and more delicious than any,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From such as now they start the scene revisiting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a flock, twittering, rising, or overhead passing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Borne hither, ere all eludes me, hurriedly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A man, yet by these tears a little boy again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Throwing myself on the sand, confronting the waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, chanter of pains and joys, uniter of here and hereafter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Taking all hints to use them, but swiftly leaping beyond them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A reminiscence sing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Once Paumanok,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the lilac-scent was in the air and Fifth-month grass was growing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up this seashore in some briers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two feather’d guests from Alabama, two together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And their nest, and four light-green eggs spotted with brown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every day the he-bird to and fro near at hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every day the she-bird crouch’d on her nest, silent, with bright eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every day I, a curious boy, never too close, never disturbing them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cautiously peering, absorbing, translating.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Shine! shine! shine!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Pour down your warmth, great sun!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>While we bask, we two together.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Two together!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Winds blow south, or winds blow north,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Day come white, or night come black,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Home, or rivers and mountains from home,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Singing all time, minding no time,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>While we two keep together.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Till of a sudden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May-be kill’d, unknown to her mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One forenoon the she-bird crouch’d not on the nest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor return’d that afternoon, nor the next,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ever appear’d again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And thenceforward all summer in the sound of the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at night under the full of the moon in calmer weather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over the hoarse surging of the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or flitting from brier to brier by day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw, I heard at intervals the remaining one, the he-bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The solitary guest from Alabama.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Blow! blow! blow!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Blow up sea-winds along Paumanok’s shore;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>I wait and I wait till you blow my mate to me.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes, when the stars glisten’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All night long on the prong of a moss-scallop’d stake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down almost amid the slapping waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sat the lone singer wonderful causing tears.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He call’d on his mate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He pour’d forth the meanings which I of all men know.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Yes my brother I know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rest might not, but I have treasur’d every note,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For more than once dimly down to the beach gliding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent, avoiding the moonbeams, blending myself with the shadows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Recalling now the obscure shapes, the echoes, the sounds and sights after their sorts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The white arms out in the breakers tirelessly tossing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, with bare feet, a child, the wind wafting my hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listen’d long and long.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Listen’d to keep, to sing, now translating the notes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Following you my brother.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Soothe! soothe! soothe!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Close on its wave soothes the wave behind,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And again another behind embracing and lapping, every one close,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>But my love soothes not me, not me.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Low hangs the moon, it rose late,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>It is lagging⁠—O I think it is heavy with love, with love.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O madly the sea pushes upon the land,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>With love, with love.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O night! do I not see my love fluttering out among the breakers?</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>What is that little black thing I see there in the white?</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Loud! loud! loud!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Loud I call to you, my love!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>High and clear I shoot my voice over the waves,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Surely you must know who is here, is here,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You must know who I am, my love.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Low-hanging moon!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>What is that dusky spot in your brown yellow?</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O it is the shape, the shape of my mate!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O moon do not keep her from me any longer.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Land! land! O land!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Whichever way I turn, O I think you could give me my mate back again if you only would,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For I am almost sure I see her dimly whichever way I look.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O rising stars!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Perhaps the one I want so much will rise, will rise with some of you.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O throat! O trembling throat!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Sound clearer through the atmosphere!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Pierce the woods, the earth,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Somewhere listening to catch you must be the one I want.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Shake out carols!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Solitary here, the night’s carols!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Carols of lonesome love! death’s carols!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Carols under that lagging, yellow, waning moon!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O under that moon where she droops almost down into the sea!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O reckless despairing carols.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>But soft! sink low!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Soft! let me just murmur,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And do you wait a moment you husky-nois’d sea,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For somewhere I believe I heard my mate responding to me,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>So faint, I must be still, be still to listen,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>But not altogether still, for then she might not come immediately to me.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Hither my love!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here I am! here!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>With this just-sustain’d note I announce myself to you,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>This gentle call is for you my love, for you.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Do not be decoy’d elsewhere,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>That is the whistle of the wind, it is not my voice,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>That is the fluttering, the fluttering of the spray,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Those are the shadows of leaves.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O darkness! O in vain!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O I am very sick and sorrowful.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O brown halo in the sky near the moon, drooping upon the sea!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O troubled reflection in the sea!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O throat! O throbbing heart!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And I singing uselessly, uselessly all the night.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>O past! O happy life! O songs of joy!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>In the air, in the woods, over fields,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Loved! loved! loved! loved! loved!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>But my mate no more, no more with me!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We two together no more.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The aria sinking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All else continuing, the stars shining,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The winds blowing, the notes of the bird continuous echoing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With angry moans the fierce old mother incessantly moaning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the sands of Paumanok’s shore gray and rustling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The yellow half-moon enlarged, sagging down, drooping, the face of the sea almost touching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The boy ecstatic, with his bare feet the waves, with his hair the atmosphere dallying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The love in the heart long pent, now loose, now at last tumultuously bursting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The aria’s meaning, the ears, the soul, swiftly depositing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The strange tears down the cheeks coursing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The colloquy there, the trio, each uttering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The undertone, the savage old mother incessantly crying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the boy’s soul’s questions sullenly timing, some drown’d secret hissing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the outsetting bard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Demon or bird! (said the boy’s soul,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is it indeed toward your mate you sing? or is it really to me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I, that was a child, my tongue’s use sleeping, now I have heard you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now in a moment I know what I am for, I awake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And already a thousand singers, a thousand songs, clearer, louder and more sorrowful than yours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand warbling echoes have started to life within me, never to die.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O you singer solitary, singing by yourself, projecting me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O solitary me listening, never more shall I cease perpetuating you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never more shall I escape, never more the reverberations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never more the cries of unsatisfied love be absent from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never again leave me to be the peaceful child I was before what there in the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the sea under the yellow and sagging moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The messenger there arous’d, the fire, the sweet hell within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unknown want, the destiny of me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O give me the clew! (it lurks in the night here somewhere,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O if I am to have so much, let me have more!</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A word then, (for I will conquer it,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The word final, superior to all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Subtle, sent up⁠—what is it?⁠—I listen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are you whispering it, and have been all the time, you sea-waves?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is that it from your liquid rims and wet sands?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whereto answering, the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delaying not, hurrying not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whisper’d me through the night, and very plainly before daybreak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lisp’d to me the low and delicious word death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And again death, death, death, death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hissing melodious, neither like the bird nor like my arous’d child’s heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But edging near as privately for me rustling at my feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Creeping thence steadily up to my ears and laving me softly all over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Death, death, death, death, death.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Which I do not forget,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fuse the song of my dusky demon and brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he sang to me in the moonlight on Paumanok’s gray beach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the thousand responsive songs at random,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My own songs awaked from that hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with them the key, the word up from the waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The word of the sweetest song and all songs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That strong and delicious word which, creeping to my feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Or like some old crone rocking the cradle, swathed in sweet garments, bending aside,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea whisper’d me.</span>

					<p>
						<span>As I ebb’d with the ocean of life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I wended the shores I know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I walk’d where the ripples continually wash you Paumanok,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where they rustle up hoarse and sibilant,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where the fierce old mother endlessly cries for her castaways,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I musing late in the autumn day, gazing off southward,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held by this electric self out of the pride of which I utter poems,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was seiz’d by the spirit that trails in the lines underfoot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rim, the sediment that stands for all the water and all the land of the globe.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fascinated, my eyes reverting from the south, dropt, to follow those slender windrows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chaff, straw, splinters of wood, weeds, and the sea-gluten,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scum, scales from shining rocks, leaves of salt-lettuce, left by the tide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Miles walking, the sound of breaking waves the other side of me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Paumanok there and then as I thought the old thought of likenesses,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These you presented to me you fish-shaped island,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I wended the shores I know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As I walk’d with that electric self seeking types.</span>

						<span>As I list to the dirge, the voices of men and women wreck’d,</span>

						<span>As I inhale the impalpable breezes that set in upon me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As the ocean so mysterious rolls toward me closer and closer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I too but signify at the utmost a little wash’d-up drift,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A few sands and dead leaves to gather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gather, and merge myself as part of the sands and drift.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O baffled, balk’d, bent to the very earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oppress’d with myself that I have dared to open my mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aware now that amid all that blab whose echoes recoil upon me I have not once had the least idea who or what I am,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that before all my arrogant poems the real Me stands yet untouch’d, untold, altogether unreach’d,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withdrawn far, mocking me with mock-congratulatory signs and bows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pointing in silence to these songs, and then to the sand beneath.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I perceive I have not really understood any thing, not a single object, and that no man ever can,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nature here in sight of the sea taking advantage of me to dart upon me and sting me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because I have dared to open my mouth to sing at all.</span>

					<span>In the night, in solitude, tears,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O who is that ghost? that form in the dark, with tears?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch’d there on the sand?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Streaming tears, sobbing tears, throes, choked with wild cries;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O storm, embodied, rising, careering with swift steps along the beach!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O wild and dismal night storm, with wind⁠—O belching and desperate!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O shade so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and regulated pace,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you must not be abased to the other.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that a kelson of the creation is love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.</span>

					<span>A child said <q>What is the grass?</q> fetching it to me with full hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say <q>Whose?</q></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Growing among black folks as among white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Tenderly will I use you curling grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And here you are the mothers’ laps.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Darker than the colorless beards of old men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What do you think has become of the young and old men?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what do you think has become of the women and children?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They are alive and well somewhere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ceas’d the moment life appear’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,</span>

					<span>I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.</span>

					<span>I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots,</span>

					<span>And brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,</span>

					<span>Now I will do nothing but listen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The steam-whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah this indeed is music⁠—this suits me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess’d them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that we call Being.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Mine is no callous shell,</span>

					<span>I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,</span>

					<span>They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.</span>

					<span>No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,</span>

					<span>I am given up by traitors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,</span>

					<span>I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.</span>

					<span>Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,</span>

					<span>Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;</span>

					<span>Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I understand the large hearts of heroes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The courage of present times and all times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And chalk’d in large letters on a board, <q>Be of good cheer, we will not desert you;</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How he saved the drifting company at last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am the man, I suffer’d, I was there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The disdain and calmness of martyrs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,</span>

					<span>Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Agonies are one of my changes of garments,</span>

					<span>I am there again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Again the long roll of the drummers,</span>

					<span>Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I take part, I see and hear the whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,</span>

					<span>Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,</span>

					<span>’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They were the glory of the race of rangers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not a single one over thirty years of age.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>None obey’d the command to kneel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>At eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies;</span>

					<span>Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Our frigate takes fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other asks if we demand quarter?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If our colors are struck and the fighting done?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span><q>We have not struck,</q> he composedly cries, <q>we have just begun our part of the fighting.</q></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Only three guns are in use,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s main-mast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not a moment’s cease,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Serene stands the little captain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.</span>

					<span>A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,</span>

					<span>Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,</span>

					<span>The hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,</span>

					<span>Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,</span>

					<span>Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,</span>

					<span>Making a fetish of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.</span>

					<span>Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,</span>

					<span>I take my place among you as much as among any,</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What is known I strip away,</span>

					<span>I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The clock indicates the moment⁠—but what does eternity indicate?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,</span>

					<span>There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.</span>

				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,</span>

					<span>All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(What have I to do with lamentation?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am an acme of things accomplish’d, and I an encloser of things to be.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All below duly travel’d, and still I mount and mount.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long I was hugg’d close⁠—long and long.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Immense have been the preparations for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>For it the nebula cohered to an orb,</span>

				<p>
					<span>My lovers suffocate me,</span>

					<span>Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crying by day <q>Ahoy!</q> from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lighting on every moment of my life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>

					<span>And the dark hush promulges as much as any.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,</span>

					<span>Outward and outward and forever outward.</span>

				<p>
					<span>My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We should surely bring up again where we now stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are but parts, any thing is but a part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,</span>

					<span>I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,</span>

					<span>I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My left hand hooking you round the waist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,</span>

					<span>You must travel it for yourself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>It is not far, it is within reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For after we start we never lie by again.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I said to my spirit <q>When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then?</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my spirit said <q>No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.</q></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You are also asking me questions and I hear you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Sit a while dear son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a goodbye kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now I wash the gum from your eyes,</span>

					<span>You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.</span>

					<span>Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,</span>

					<span>No shutter’d room or school can commune with me,</span>

					<span>In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.</span>

					<span>On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,</span>

			<section id="song-of-the-answerer-1" epub:type="part">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">1</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Now list to my morning’s romanza, I tell the signs of the Answerer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the cities and farms I sing as they spread in the sunshine before me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A young man comes to me bearing a message from his brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How shall the young man know the whether and when of his brother?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell him to send me the signs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>And I stand before the young man face to face, and take his right hand in my left hand and his left hand in my right hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I answer for his brother and for men, and I answer for him that answers for all, and send these signs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Him all wait for, him all yield up to, his word is decisive and final,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him they accept, in him lave, in him perceive themselves as amid light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him they immerse and he immerses them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Beautiful women, the haughtiest nations, laws, the landscape, people, animals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The profound earth and its attributes and the unquiet ocean, (so tell I my morning’s romanza,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All enjoyments and properties and money, and whatever money will buy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The best farms, others toiling and planting and he unavoidably reaps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The noblest and costliest cities, others grading and building and he domiciles there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing for any one but what is for him, near and far are for him, the ships in the offing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The perpetual shows and marches on land are for him if they are for anybody.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He puts things in their attitudes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He puts to-day out of himself with plasticity and love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He places his own times, reminiscences, parents, brothers and sisters, associations, employment, politics, so that the rest never shame them afterward, nor assume to command them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He is the Answerer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What can be answer’d he answers, and what cannot be answer’d he shows how it cannot be answer’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>A man is a summons and challenge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(It is vain to skulk⁠—do you hear that mocking and laughter? do you hear the ironical echoes?)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Books, friendships, philosophers, priests, action, pleasure, pride, beat up and down seeking to give satisfaction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He indicates the satisfaction, and indicates them that beat up and down also.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whichever the sex, whatever the season or place, he may go freshly and gently and safely by day or by night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He has the pass-key of hearts, to him the response of the prying of hands on the knobs.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>His welcome is universal, the flow of beauty is not more welcome or universal than he is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The person he favors by day or sleeps with at night is blessed.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Every existence has its idiom, everything has an idiom and tongue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows it upon men, and any man translates, and any man translates himself also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One part does not counteract another part, he is the joiner, he sees how they join.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He says indifferently and alike <q>How are you friend?</q> to the President at his levee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he says <q>Good day my brother,</q> to Cudge that hoes in the sugar-field,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And both understand him and know that his speech is right.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>He walks with perfect ease in the capitol,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He walks among the Congress, and one Representative says to another, <q>Here is our equal appearing and new.</q></span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then the mechanics take him for a mechanic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the soldiers suppose him to be a soldier, and the sailors that he has follow’d the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the authors take him for an author, and the artists for an artist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the laborers perceive he could labor with them and love them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No matter what the work is, that he is the one to follow it or has follow’d it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No matter what the nation, that he might find his brothers and sisters there.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The English believe he comes of their English stock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Jew to the Jew he seems, a Russ to the Russ, usual and near, removed from none.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Whoever he looks at in the traveler’s coffee-house claims him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Italian or Frenchman is sure, the German is sure, the Spaniard is sure, and the island Cuban is sure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The engineer, the deck-hand on the great lakes, or on the Mississippi or <abbr>St.</abbr> Lawrence or Sacramento, or Hudson or Paumanok sound, claims him.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The gentleman of perfect blood acknowledges his perfect blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The insulter, the prostitute, the angry person, the beggar, see themselves in the ways of him, he strangely transmutes them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are not vile any more, they hardly know themselves they are so grown.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The indications and tally of time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perfect sanity shows the master among philosophs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Time, always without break, indicates itself in parts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What always indicates the poet is the crowd of the pleasant company of singers, and their words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The words of the singers are the hours or minutes of the light or dark, but the words of the maker of poems are the general light and dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maker of poems settles justice, reality, immortality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His insight and power encircle things and the human race,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He is the glory and extract thus far of things and of the human race.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The singers do not beget, only the Poet begets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The singers are welcom’d, understood, appear often enough, but rare has the day been, likewise the spot, of the birth of the maker of poems, the Answerer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Not every century nor every five centuries has contain’d such a day, for all its names.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The singers of successive hours of centuries may have ostensible names, but the name of each of them is one of the singers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The name of each is, eye-singer, ear-singer, head-singer, sweet-singer, night-singer, parlor-singer, love-singer, weird-singer, or something else.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All this time and at all times wait the words of true poems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The words of true poems do not merely please,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The true poets are not followers of beauty but the august masters of beauty;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greatness of sons is the exuding of the greatness of mothers and fathers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The words of true poems are the tuft and final applause of science.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Divine instinct, breadth of vision, the law of reason, health, rudeness of body, withdrawnness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gayety, sun-tan, air-sweetness, such are some of the words of poems.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The sailor and traveler underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The builder, geometer, chemist, anatomist, phrenologist, artist, all these underlie the maker of poems, the Answerer.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The words of the true poems give you more than poems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They give you to form for yourself poems, religions, politics, war, peace, behavior, histories, essays, daily life, and everything else,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They balance ranks, colors, races, creeds, and the sexes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They do not seek beauty, they are sought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever touching them or close upon them follows beauty, longing, fain, love-sick.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>They prepare for death, yet they are not the finish, but rather the outset,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They bring none to his or her terminus or to be content and full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom they take they take into space to behold the birth of stars, to learn one of the meanings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless rings and never be quiet again.</span>

					<span>The log at the wood-pile, the axe supported by it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sylvan hut, the vine over the doorway, the space clear’d for a garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The irregular tapping of rain down on the leaves after the storm is lull’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wailing and moaning at intervals, the thought of the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The thought of ships struck in the storm and put on their beam ends, and the cutting away of masts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sentiment of the huge timbers of old-fashion’d houses and barns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The remember’d print or narrative, the voyage at a venture of men, families, goods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The disembarkation, the founding of a new city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voyage of those who sought a New England and found it, the outset anywhere,</span>

					<span>The settlements of the Arkansas, Colorado, Ottawa, Willamette,</span>

					<span>The beauty of all adventurous and daring persons,</span>

					<span>The American contempt for statutes and ceremonies, the boundless impatience of restraint,</span>

					<span>The loose drift of character, the inkling through random types, the solidification;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The butcher in the slaughter-house, the hands aboard schooners and sloops, the raftsman, the pioneer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lumbermen in their winter camp, daybreak in the woods, stripes of snow on the limbs of trees, the occasional snapping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The glad clear sound of one’s own voice, the merry song, the natural life of the woods, the strong day’s work,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The blazing fire at night, the sweet taste of supper, the talk, the bed of hemlock-boughs and the bear-skin;</span>

					<span>The blows of mallets and hammers, the attitudes of the men, their curv’d limbs,</span>

					<span>The piles of materials, the mortar on the mortar-boards, and the steady replenishing by the hod-men;</span>

					<span>The butter-color’d chips flying off in great flakes and slivers,</span>

					<span>The limber motion of brawny young arms and hips in easy costumes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The constructor of wharves, bridges, piers, bulk-heads, floats, stays against the sea;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The city fireman, the fire that suddenly bursts forth in the close-pack’d square,</span>

					<span>The arriving engines, the hoarse shouts, the nimble stepping and daring,</span>

					<span>The crowd with their lit faces watching, the glare and dense shadows;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>The siege of revolted lieges determin’d for liberty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The summons to surrender, the battering at castle gates, the truce and parley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sack of an old city in its time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bursting in of mercenaries and bigots tumultuously and disorderly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Roar, flames, blood, drunkenness, madness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goods freely rifled from houses and temples, screams of women in the gripe of brigands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Craft and thievery of camp-followers, men running, old persons despairing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hell of war, the cruelties of creeds,</span>

					<span>Where no monuments exist to heroes but in the common words and deeds,</span>

					<span>Where thrift is in its place, and prudence is in its place,</span>

					<span>Where the men and women think lightly of the laws,</span>

					<span>Where the citizen is always the head and ideal, and President, Mayor, Governor and whatnot, are agents for pay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where children are taught to be laws to themselves, and to depend on themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where equanimity is illustrated in affairs,</span>

					<span>Where speculations on the soul are encouraged,</span>

					<span>Away with love-verses sugar’d in rhyme, the intrigues, amours of idlers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fitted for only banquets of the night where dancers to late music slide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unhealthy pleasures, extravagant dissipations of the few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With perfumes, heat and wine, beneath the dazzling chandeliers.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>To you ye reverent sane sisters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I raise a voice for far superber themes for poets and for art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To exalt the present and the real,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To teach the average man the glory of his daily walk and trade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sing in songs how exercise and chemical life are never to be baffled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To manual work for each and all, to plough, hoe, dig,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To plant and tend the tree, the berry, vegetables, flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For every man to see to it that he really do something, for every woman too;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To use the hammer and the saw, (rip, or cross-cut,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To cultivate a turn for carpentering, plastering, painting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To work as tailor, tailoress, nurse, hostler, porter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To invent a little, something ingenious, to aid the washing, cooking, cleaning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hold it no disgrace to take a hand at them themselves.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I say I bring thee Muse to-day and here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All occupations, duties broad and close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toil, healthy toil and sweat, endless, without cessation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The old, old practical burdens, interests, joys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The family, parentage, childhood, husband and wife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The house-comforts, the house itself and all its belongings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Food and its preservation, chemistry applied to it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever forms the average, strong, complete, sweet-blooded man or woman, the perfect longeve personality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And helps its present life to health and happiness, and shapes its soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the eternal real life to come.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With latest connections, works, the inter-transportation of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Steam-power, the great express lines, gas, petroleum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These triumphs of our time, the Atlantic’s delicate cable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Pacific railroad, the Suez canal, the Mont Cenis and Gothard and Hoosac tunnels, the Brooklyn bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This earth all spann’d with iron rails, with lines of steamships threading every sea,</span>

					<span>Our own rondure, the current globe I bring.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>See, the steamers coming and going, steaming in or out of port,</span>

					<span>Savagely struggled for, for life or death, fought over long,</span>

					<span>’Mid cannons’ thunder-crash and many a curse and groan and yell, and rifle-volleys cracking sharp,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Afoot and light-hearted I take to the open road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Healthy, free, the world before me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The long brown path before me leading wherever I choose.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Henceforth I ask not good-fortune, I myself am good-fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Henceforth I whimper no more, postpone no more, need nothing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Done with indoor complaints, libraries, querulous criticisms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Strong and content I travel the open road.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The earth, that is sufficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not want the constellations any nearer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know they are very well where they are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know they suffice for those who belong to them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>(Still here I carry my old delicious burdens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I carry them, men and women, I carry them with me wherever I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I swear it is impossible for me to get rid of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am fill’d with them, and I will fill them in return.)</span>

				<p>
					<span>You road I enter upon and look around, I believe you are not all that is here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I believe that much unseen is also here.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here the profound lesson of reception, nor preference nor denial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The black with his woolly head, the felon, the diseas’d, the illiterate person, are not denied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The birth, the hasting after the physician, the beggar’s tramp, the drunkard’s stagger, the laughing party of mechanics,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The escaped youth, the rich person’s carriage, the fop, the eloping couple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The early market-man, the hearse, the moving of furniture into the town, the return back from the town,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They pass, I also pass, anything passes, none can be interdicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None but are accepted, none but shall be dear to me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>You air that serves me with breath to speak!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You objects that call from diffusion my meanings and give them shape!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You light that wraps me and all things in delicate equable showers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You paths worn in the irregular hollows by the roadsides!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I believe you are latent with unseen existences, you are so dear to me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>You flagg’d walks of the cities! you strong curbs at the edges!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You ferries! you planks and posts of wharves! you timber-lined sides! you distant ships!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You rows of houses! you window-pierc’d façades! you roofs!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You porches and entrances! you copings and iron guards!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You windows whose transparent shells might expose so much!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You doors and ascending steps! you arches!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You gray stones of interminable pavements! you trodden crossings!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From all that has touch’d you I believe you have imparted to yourselves, and now would impart the same secretly to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the living and the dead you have peopled your impassive surfaces, and the spirits thereof would be evident and amicable with me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>The earth expanding right hand and left hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The picture alive, every part in its best light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The music falling in where it is wanted, and stopping where it is not wanted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The cheerful voice of the public road, the gay fresh sentiment of the road.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O highway I travel, do you say to me <q>Do not leave me</q>?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you say <q>Venture not⁠—if you leave me you are lost</q>?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you say <q>I am already prepared, I am well-beaten and undenied, adhere to me</q>?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O public road, I say back I am not afraid to leave you, yet I love you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You express me better than I can express myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall be more to me than my poem.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I think heroic deeds were all conceiv’d in the open air, and all free poems also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think I could stop here myself and do miracles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think whatever I shall meet on the road I shall like, and whoever beholds me shall like me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think whoever I see must be happy.</span>

				<p>
					<span>From this hour I ordain myself loos’d of limits and imaginary lines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Going where I list, my own master total and absolute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listening to others, considering well what they say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pausing, searching, receiving, contemplating,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gently, but with undeniable will, divesting myself of the holds that would hold me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I inhale great draughts of space,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The east and the west are mine, and the north and the south are mine.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I am larger, better than I thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not know I held so much goodness.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>All seems beautiful to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I can repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me I would do the same to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will recruit for myself and you as I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will scatter myself among men and women as I go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appear’d it would not astonish me.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here a great personal deed has room,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks all authority and all argument against it.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here is the test of wisdom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom is not finally tested in schools,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom cannot be pass’d from one having it to another not having it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom is of the soul, is not susceptible of proof, is its own proof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things, and the excellence of things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokes it out of the soul.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now I re-examine philosophies and religions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They may prove well in lecture-rooms, yet not prove at all under the spacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here is realization,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here is a man tallied⁠—he realizes here what he has in him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The past, the future, majesty, love⁠—if they are vacant of you, you are vacant of them.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Only the kernel of every object nourishes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here is adhesiveness, it is not previously fashion’d, it is apropos;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do you know the talk of those turning eye-balls?</span>

			<section id="song-of-the-open-road-7" epub:type="part">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">7</h3>
				<p>
					<span>Here is the efflux of the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The efflux of the soul comes from within through embower’d gates, ever provoking questions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These yearnings why are they? these thoughts in the darkness why are they?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlight expands my blood?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodious thoughts descend upon me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and always drop fruit as I pass;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk by and pause?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What gives me to be free to a woman’s and man’s good-will? what gives them to be free to mine?</span>
				</p>
			</section>
			<section id="song-of-the-open-road-8" epub:type="part">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">8</h3>
				<p>
					<span>The efflux of the soul is happiness, here is happiness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think it pervades the open air, waiting at all times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now it flows unto us, we are rightly charged.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Here rises the fluid and attaching character,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness of man and woman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every day out of the roots of themselves, than it sprouts fresh and sweet continually out of itself.)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of the love of young and old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From it falls distill’d the charm that mocks beauty and attainments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact.</span>

					<span>I do not offer the old smooth prizes, but offer rough new prizes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These are the days that must happen to you:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall not heap up what is call’d riches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall scatter with lavish hand all that you earn or achieve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You but arrive at the city to which you were destin’d, you hardly settle yourself to satisfaction before you are call’d by an irresistible call to depart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall be treated to the ironical smiles and mockings of those who remain behind you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What beckonings of love you receive you shall only answer with passionate kisses of parting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You shall not allow the hold of those who spread their reach’d hands toward you.</span>

					<span>To merge all in the travel they tend to, and the days and nights they tend to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again to merge them in the start of superior journeys,</span>

					<span>To see nothing anywhere but what you may reach it and pass it,</span>

					<span>To conceive no time, however distant, but what you may reach it and pass it,</span>

					<span>To see no being, not God’s or any, but you also go thither,</span>

					<span>To see no possession but you may possess it, enjoying all without labor or purchase, abstracting the feast yet not abstracting one particle of it,</span>

			<section id="song-of-the-redwood-tree-1" epub:type="part">
				<h3 epub:type="ordinal">1</h3>
				<p>
					<span>A California song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A prophecy and indirection, a thought impalpable to breathe as air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A chorus of dryads, fading, departing, or hamadryads departing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A murmuring, fateful, giant voice, out of the earth and sky,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Voice of a mighty dying tree in the redwood forest dense.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Farewell my brethren,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Farewell O earth and sky, farewell ye neighboring waters,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>My time has ended, my term has come.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Along the northern coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just back from the rock-bound shore and the caves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the saline air from the sea in the Mendocino country,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the surge for base and accompaniment low and hoarse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With crackling blows of axes sounding musically driven by strong arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Riven deep by the sharp tongues of the axes, there in the redwood forest dense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard the mighty tree its death-chant chanting.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>The choppers heard not, the camp shanties echoed not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The quick-ear’d teamsters and chain and jack-screw men heard not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the wood-spirits came from their haunts of a thousand years to join the refrain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in my soul I plainly heard.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Murmuring out of its myriad leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down from its lofty top rising two hundred feet high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of its stalwart trunk and limbs, out of its foot-thick bark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That chant of the seasons and time, chant not of the past only but the future.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>You untold life of me,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And all you venerable and innocent joys,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Perennial hardy life of me with joys ’mid rain and many a summer sun,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And the white snows and night and the wild winds;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>O the great patient rugged joys, my soul’s strong joys unreck’d by man,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>(For know I bear the soul befitting me, I too have consciousness, identity,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And all the rocks and mountains have, and all the earth,)</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Joys of the life befitting me and brothers mine,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Our time, our term has come.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Nor yield we mournfully majestic brothers,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We who have grandly fill’d our time;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>With Nature’s calm content, with tacit huge delight,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We welcome what we wrought for through the past,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>And leave the field for them.</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For them predicted long,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For a superber race, they too to grandly fill their time,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>For them we abdicate, in them ourselves ye forest kings!</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>In them these skies and airs, these mountain peaks, Shasta, Nevadas,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>These huge precipitous cliffs, this amplitude, these valleys, far Yosemite,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To be in them absorb’d, assimilated.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Then to a loftier strain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still prouder, more ecstatic rose the chant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As if the heirs, the deities of the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joining with master-tongue bore part.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>Not wan from Asia’s fetishes,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Nor red from Europe’s old dynastic slaughter-house,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>(Area of murder-plots of thrones, with scent left yet of wars and scaffolds everywhere,)</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>But come from Nature’s long and harmless throes, peacefully builded thence,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>These virgin lands, lands of the Western shore,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To the new culminating man, to you, the empire new,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You promis’d long, we pledge, we dedicate.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>You occult deep volitions,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You average spiritual manhood, purpose of all, pois’d on yourself, giving not taking law,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You womanhood divine, mistress and source of all, whence life and love and aught that comes from life and love,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You unseen moral essence of all the vast materials of America, (age upon age working in death the same as life,)</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You that, sometimes known, oftener unknown, really shape and mould the New World, adjusting it to Time and Space,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You hidden national will lying in your abysms, conceal’d but ever alert,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You past and present purposes tenaciously pursued, may-be unconscious of yourselves,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Unswerv’d by all the passing errors, perturbations of the surface;</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>You vital, universal, deathless germs, beneath all creeds, arts, statutes, literatures,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here build your homes for good, establish here, these areas entire, lands of the Western shore,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>We pledge, we dedicate to you.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>
						<q>For man of you, your characteristic race,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here may he hardy, sweet, gigantic grow, here tower proportionate to Nature,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here climb the vast pure spaces unconfined, uncheck’d by wall or roof,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here laugh with storm or sun, here joy, here patiently inure,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>Here heed himself, unfold himself, (not others’ formulas heed,) here fill his time,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To duly fall, to aid, unreck’d at last,</q>
					</span>
					<br/>
					<span>
						<q>To disappear, to serve.</q>
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thus on the northern coast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the echo of teamsters’ calls and the clinking chains, and the music of choppers’ axes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The falling trunk and limbs, the crash, the muffled shriek, the groan,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such words combined from the redwood-tree, as of voices ecstatic, ancient and rustling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The century-lasting, unseen dryads, singing, withdrawing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All their recesses of forests and mountains leaving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the Cascade range to the Wahsatch, or Idaho far, or Utah,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the deities of the modern henceforth yielding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The chorus and indications, the vistas of coming humanity, the settlements, features all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the Mendocino woods I caught.</span>

					<span>The flashing and golden pageant of California,</span>

					<span>The sudden and gorgeous drama, the sunny and ample lands,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Lands bathed in sweeter, rarer, healthier air, valleys and mountain cliffs,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Years of the modern! years of the unperform’d!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your horizon rises, I see it parting away for more august dramas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see not America only, not only Liberty’s nation but other nations preparing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see tremendous entrances and exits, new combinations, the solidarity of races,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that force advancing with irresistible power on the world’s stage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Have the old forces, the old wars, played their parts? are the acts suitable to them closed?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see Freedom, completely arm’d and victorious and very haughty, with Law on one side and Peace on the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A stupendous trio all issuing forth against the idea of caste;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What historic denouements are these we so rapidly approach?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see men marching and countermarching by swift millions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the frontiers and boundaries of the old aristocracies broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the landmarks of European kings removed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see this day the People beginning their landmarks, (all others give way;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never were such sharp questions ask’d as this day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never was average man, his soul, more energetic, more like a God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, how he urges and urges, leaving the masses no rest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His daring foot is on land and sea everywhere, he colonizes the Pacific, the archipelagoes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the steamship, the electric telegraph, the newspaper, the wholesale engines of war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With these and the world-spreading factories he interlinks all geography, all lands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What whispers are these O lands, running ahead of you, passing under the seas?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are all nations communing? is there going to be but one heart to the globe?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is humanity forming en-masse? for lo, tyrants tremble, crowns grow dim,</span>

					<span>The earth, restive, confronts a new era, perhaps a general divine war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No one knows what will happen next, such portents fill the days and nights;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Years prophetical! the space ahead as I walk, as I vainly try to pierce it, is full of phantoms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unborn deeds, things soon to be, project their shapes around me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This incredible rush and heat, this strange ecstatic fever of dreams O years!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your dreams O years, how they penetrate through me! (I know not whether I sleep or wake;)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The perform’d America and Europe grow dim, retiring in shadow behind me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The unperform’d, more gigantic than ever, advance, advance upon me.</span>

				</p>
				<p>

					<span>And silently gather round me.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now sound no note O trumpeters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not at the head of my cavalry parading on spirited horses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sabres drawn and glistening, and carbines by their thighs, (ah my brave horsemen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My handsome tan-faced horsemen! what life, what joy and pride,</span>

					<span>With all the perils were yours.)</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Nothing from you this time O drummers bearing my warlike drums.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>But aside from these and the marts of wealth and the crowded promenade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Admitting around me comrades close unseen by the rest and voiceless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The slain elate and alive again, the dust and debris alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I chant this chant of my silent soul in the name of all dead soldiers.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Faces so pale with wondrous eyes, very dear, gather closer yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Draw close, but speak not.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Phantoms of countless lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Invisible to the rest henceforth become my companions,</span>

				<p>
					<span>Dearest comrades, all is over and long gone,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Perfume from battle-fields rising, up from the foetor arising.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Perfume therefore my chant, O love, immortal love,</span>

					<span>Give me to bathe the memories of all dead soldiers,</span>

						<span>Of these years I sing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How they pass and have pass’d through convuls’d pains, as through parturitions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How America illustrates birth, muscular youth, the promise, the sure fulfilment, the absolute success, despite of people⁠—illustrates evil as well as good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The vehement struggle so fierce for unity in one’s-self;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many hold despairingly yet to the models departed, caste, myths, obedience, compulsion, and to infidelity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How few see the arrived models, the athletes, the Western States, or see freedom or spirituality, or hold any faith in results,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(But I see the athletes, and I see the results of the war glorious and inevitable, and they again leading to other results.)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>How the great cities appear⁠—how the Democratic masses, turbulent, wilful, as I love them,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How the whirl, the contest, the wrestle of evil with good, the sounding and resounding, keep on and on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How society waits unform’d, and is for a while between things ended and things begun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How America is the continent of glories, and of the triumph of freedom and of the Democracies, and of the fruits of society, and of all that is begun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how the States are complete in themselves⁠—and how all triumphs and glories are complete in themselves, to lead onward,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how these of mine and of the States will in their turn be convuls’d, and serve other parturitions and transitions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how all people, sights, combinations, the democratic masses too, serve⁠—and how every fact, and war itself, with all its horrors, serves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how now or at any time each serves the exquisite transition of death.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Of what a few years will show there in Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, and the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Or afar, mounting the Northern Pacific to Sitka or Aliaska,)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of what the feuillage of America is the preparation for⁠—and of what all sights, North, South, East and West, are,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of this Union welded in blood, of the solemn price paid, of the unnamed lost ever present in my mind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the temporary use of materials for identity’s sake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the present, passing, departing⁠—of the growth of completer men than any yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all sloping down there where the fresh free giver the mother, the Mississippi flows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mighty inland cities yet unsurvey’d and unsuspected,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of the new and good names, of the modern developments, of inalienable homesteads,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a free and original life there, of simple diet and clean and sweet blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of litheness, majestic faces, clear eyes, and perfect physique there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of immense spiritual results future years far West, each side of the Anahuacs,</span>

					<span>When breeds of the most perfect mothers denote America,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to me and mine our due fruition.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have press’d through in my own right,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have sung the body and the soul, war and peace have I sung, and the songs of life and death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the songs of birth, and shown that there are many births.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I have offer’d my style to every one, I have journey’d with confident step;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While my pleasure is yet at the full I whisper <q>So long!</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And take the young woman’s hand and the young man’s hand for the last time.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I announce natural persons to arise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce justice triumphant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce uncompromising liberty and equality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce the justification of candor and the justification of pride.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I announce that the identity of these States is a single identity only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce the Union more and more compact, indissoluble,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce splendors and majesties to make all the previous politics of the earth insignificant.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I announce adhesiveness, I say it shall be limitless, unloosen’d,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say you shall yet find the friend you were looking for.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I announce a man or woman coming, perhaps you are the one, (<q>So long!</q>)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce the great individual, fluid as Nature, chaste, affectionate, compassionate, fully arm’d.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I announce a life that shall be copious, vehement, spiritual, bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce an end that shall lightly and joyfully meet its translation.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I announce myriads of youths, beautiful, gigantic, sweet-blooded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I announce a race of splendid and savage old men.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O thicker and faster⁠—(<q>So long!</q>)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O crowding too close upon me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I foresee too much, it means more than I thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It appears to me I am dying.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Hasten throat and sound your last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Salute me⁠—salute the days once more. Peal the old cry once more.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Screaming electric, the atmosphere using,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At random glancing, each as I notice absorbing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Swiftly on, but a little while alighting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Curious envelop’d messages delivering,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sparkles hot, seed ethereal down in the dirt dropping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Myself unknowing, my commission obeying, to question it never daring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To ages and ages yet the growth of the seed leaving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To troops out of the war arising, they the tasks I have set promulging,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To women certain whispers of myself bequeathing, their affection me more clearly explaining,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To young men my problems offering⁠—no dallier I⁠—I the muscle of their brains trying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I pass, a little time vocal, visible, contrary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Afterward a melodious echo, passionately bent for, (death making me really undying,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The best of me then when no longer visible, for toward that I have been incessantly preparing.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>What is there more, that I lag and pause and crouch extended with unshut mouth?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Is there a single final farewell?</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>My songs cease, I abandon them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From behind the screen where I hid I advance personally solely to you.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Camerado, this is no book,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who touches this touches a man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Is it night? are we here together alone?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is I you hold and who holds you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I spring from the pages into your arms⁠—decease calls me forth.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O how your fingers drowse me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your breath falls around me like dew, your pulse lulls the tympans of my ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I feel immerged from head to foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Delicious, enough.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Enough O deed impromptu and secret,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Enough O gliding present⁠—enough O summ’d-up past.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Dear friend whoever you are take this kiss,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I give it especially to you, do not forget me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I feel like one who has done work for the day to retire awhile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I receive now again of my many translations, from my avataras ascending, while others doubtless await me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>An unknown sphere more real than I dream’d, more direct, darts awakening rays about me, <q>So long!</q></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remember my words, I may again return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I love you, I depart from materials,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am as one disembodied, triumphant, dead.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Starting from fish-shape Paumanok where I was born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well-begotten, and rais’d by a perfect mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After roaming many lands, lover of populous pavements,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dweller in Mannahatta my city, or on southern savannas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or a soldier camp’d or carrying my knapsack and gun, or a miner in California,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or rude in my home in Dakota’s woods, my diet meat, my drink from the spring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or withdrawn to muse and meditate in some deep recess,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far from the clank of crowds intervals passing rapt and happy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aware of the fresh free giver the flowing Missouri, aware of mighty Niagara,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aware of the buffalo herds grazing the plains, the hirsute and strong-breasted bull,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of earth, rocks, Fifth-month flowers experienced, stars, rain, snow, my amaze,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Having studied the mocking-bird’s tones and the flight of the mountain-hawk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard at dawn the unrivall’d one, the hermit thrush from the swamp-cedars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Solitary, singing in the West, I strike up for a New World.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Victory, union, faith, identity, time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The indissoluble compacts, riches, mystery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eternal progress, the kosmos, and the modern reports.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>This then is life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here is what has come to the surface after so many throes and convulsions.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How curious! how real!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underfoot the divine soil, overhead the sun.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>See revolving the globe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ancestor-continents away group’d together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The present and future continents north and south, with the isthmus between.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>See, vast trackless spaces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a dream they change, they swiftly fill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Countless masses debouch upon them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They are now cover’d with the foremost people, arts, institutions, known.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>See, projected through time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For me an audience interminable.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>With firm and regular step they wend, they never stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Successions of men, Americanos, a hundred millions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One generation playing its part and passing on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another generation playing its part and passing on in its turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With faces turn’d sideways or backward towards me to listen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyes retrospective towards me.</span>

					<span>For you a programme of chants.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Chants of the prairies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chants of the long-running Mississippi, and down to the Mexican sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Chants of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Wisconsin and Minnesota,</span>

					<span>Here the heir-ship and heiress-ship of the world, here the flame of materials,</span>

				<p>
					<span>The soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever and forever⁠—longer than soil is brown and solid⁠—longer than water ebbs and flows.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will make the poems of materials, for I think they are to be the most spiritual poems,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I will make the poems of my body and of mortality,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I think I shall then supply myself with the poems of my soul and of immortality.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will make a song for these States that no one State may under any circumstances be subjected to another State,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I will make a song that there shall be comity by day and by night between all the States, and between any two of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I will make a song for the ears of the President, full of weapons with menacing points,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And behind the weapons countless dissatisfied faces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a song make I of the One form’d out of all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The fang’d and glittering One whose head is over all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Resolute warlike One including and over all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(However high the head of any else that head is over all.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will acknowledge contemporary lands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will trail the whole geography of the globe and salute courteously every city large and small,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And employments! I will put in my poems that with you is heroism upon land and sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I will report all heroism from an American point of view.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I will sing the song of companionship,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will show what alone must finally compact these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I believe these are to found their own ideal of manly love, indicating it in me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will therefore let flame from me the burning fires that were threatening to consume me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will lift what has too long kept down those smouldering fires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will give them complete abandonment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will write the evangel-poem of comrades and of love,</span>

					<span>Here is what sings unrestricted faith.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Omnes! omnes! let others ignore what they may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I make the poem of evil also, I commemorate that part also,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am myself just as much evil as good, and my nation is⁠—and I say there is in fact no evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Or if there is I say it is just as important to you, to the land or to me, as anything else.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I too, following many and follow’d by many, inaugurate a religion, I descend into the arena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(It may be I am destin’d to utter the loudest cries there, the winner’s pealing shouts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who knows? they may rise from me yet, and soar above everything.)</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Each is not for its own sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say the whole earth and all the stars in the sky are for religion’s sake.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I say no man has ever yet been half devout enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None has ever yet adored or worship’d half enough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>None has begun to think how divine he himself is, and how certain the future is.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I say that the real and permanent grandeur of these States must be their religion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Otherwise there is no real and permanent grandeur;</span>

					<p>
						<span>I wander all night in my vision,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stepping with light feet, swiftly and noiselessly stepping and stopping,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bending with open eyes over the shut eyes of sleepers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wandering and confused, lost to myself, ill-assorted, contradictory,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pausing, gazing, bending, and stopping.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>How solemn they look there, stretch’d and still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How quiet they breathe, the little children in their cradles.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The wretched features of ennuyés, the white features of corpses, the livid faces of drunkards, the sick-gray faces of onanists,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gash’d bodies on battle-fields, the insane in their strong-door’d rooms, the sacred idiots, the new-born emerging from gates, and the dying emerging from gates,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The night pervades them and infolds them.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The married couple sleep calmly in their bed, he with his palm on the hip of the wife, and she with her palm on the hip of the husband,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sisters sleep lovingly side by side in their bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The men sleep lovingly side by side in theirs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the mother sleeps with her little child carefully wrapt.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The blind sleep, and the deaf and dumb sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prisoner sleeps well in the prison, the runaway son sleeps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The murderer that is to be hung next day, how does he sleep?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the murder’d person, how does he sleep?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The female that loves unrequited sleeps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the male that loves unrequited sleeps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The head of the money-maker that plotted all day sleeps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And the enraged and treacherous dispositions, all, all sleep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I stand in the dark with drooping eyes by the worst-suffering and the most restless,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I pass my hands soothingly to and fro a few inches from them,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The restless sink in their beds, they fitfully sleep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now I pierce the darkness, new beings appear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The earth recedes from me into the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw that it was beautiful, and I see that what is not the earth is beautiful.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I go from bedside to bedside, I sleep close with the other sleepers each in turn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I dream in my dream all the dreams of the other dreamers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I become the other dreamers.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I am a dance⁠—play up there! the fit is whirling me fast!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I am the ever-laughing⁠—it is new moon and twilight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see the hiding of douceurs, I see nimble ghosts whichever way I look,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cache and cache again deep in the ground and sea, and where it is neither ground nor sea.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Only from me can they hide nothing, and would not if they could,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And surround me and lead me and run ahead when I walk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lift their cunning covers to signify me with stretch’d arms, and resume the way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Onward we move, a gay gang of blackguards! with mirth-shouting music and wild-flapping pennants of joy!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I am the actor, the actress, the voter, the politician,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The emigrant and the exile, the criminal that stood in the box,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He who has been famous and he who shall be famous after to-day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stammerer, the well-formed person, the wasted or feeble person.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I am she who adorn’d herself and folded her hair expectantly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My truant lover has come, and it is dark.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Double yourself and receive me darkness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Receive me and my lover too, he will not let me go without him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I roll myself upon you as upon a bed, I resign myself to the dusk.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He whom I call answers me and takes the place of my lover,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rises with me silently from the bed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Darkness, you are gentler than my lover, his flesh was sweaty and panting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I feel the hot moisture yet that he left me.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>My hands are spread forth, I pass them in all directions,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I would sound up the shadowy shore to which you are journeying.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Be careful darkness! already what was it touch’d me?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I thought my lover had gone, else darkness and he are one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I hear the heart-beat, I follow, I fade away.</span>

						<span>I descend my western course, my sinews are flaccid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perfume and youth course through me and I am their wake.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It is my face yellow and wrinkled instead of the old woman’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I sit low in a straw-bottom chair and carefully darn my grandson’s stockings.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It is I too, the sleepless widow looking out on the winter midnight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see the sparkles of starshine on the icy and pallid earth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A shroud I see and I am the shroud, I wrap a body and lie in the coffin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is dark here under ground, it is not evil or pain here, it is blank here, for reasons.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>(It seems to me that everything in the light and air ought to be happy,</span>

						<span>I see a beautiful gigantic swimmer swimming naked through the eddies of the sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His brown hair lies close and even to his head, he strikes out with courageous arms, he urges himself with his legs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I see his white body, I see his undaunted eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I hate the swift-running eddies that would dash him head-foremost on the rocks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What are you doing you ruffianly red-trickled waves?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Will you kill the courageous giant? will you kill him in the prime of his middle age?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Steady and long he struggles,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He is baffled, bang’d, bruis’d, he holds out while his strength holds out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slapping eddies are spotted with his blood, they bear him away, they roll him, swing him, turn him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His beautiful body is borne in the circling eddies, it is continually bruis’d on rocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swiftly and out of sight is borne the brave corpse.</span>

					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The beach is cut by the razory ice-wind, the wreck-guns sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tempest lulls, the moon comes floundering through the drifts.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I look where the ship helplessly heads end on, I hear the burst as she strikes, I hear the howls of dismay, they grow fainter and fainter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I cannot aid with my wringing fingers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I can but rush to the surf and let it drench me and freeze upon me.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>I search with the crowd, not one of the company is wash’d to us alive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the morning I help pick up the dead and lay them in rows in a barn.</span>

						<span>Washington stands inside the lines, he stands on the intrench’d hills amid a crowd of officers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His face is cold and damp, he cannot repress the weeping drops,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He lifts the glass perpetually to his eyes, the color is blanch’d from his cheeks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sees the slaughter of the southern braves confided to him by their parents.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The same at last and at last when peace is declared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stands in the room of the old tavern, the well-belov’d soldiers all pass through,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The officers speechless and slow draw near in their turns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chief encircles their necks with his arm and kisses them on the cheek,</span>
						<br/>

						<span>Now what my mother told me one day as we sat at dinner together,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of when she was a nearly grown girl living home with her parents on the old homestead.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A red squaw came one breakfast-time to the old homestead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On her back she carried a bundle of rushes for rush-bottoming chairs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her hair, straight, shiny, coarse, black, profuse, half-envelop’d her face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her step was free and elastic, and her voice sounded exquisitely as she spoke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>My mother look’d in delight and amazement at the stranger,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She look’d at the freshness of her tall-borne face and full and pliant limbs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The more she look’d upon her she loved her,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never before had she seen such wonderful beauty and purity,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She made her sit on a bench by the jamb of the fireplace, she cook’d food for her,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She had no work to give her, but she gave her remembrance and fondness.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The red squaw staid all the forenoon, and toward the middle of the afternoon she went away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O my mother was loth to have her go away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All the week she thought of her, she watch’d for her many a month,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She remember’d her many a winter and many a summer,</span>

						<span>But the red squaw never came nor was heard of there again.</span>

						<span>It comes from its embower’d garden and looks pleasantly on itself and encloses the world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perfect and clean the genitals previously jetting, and perfect and clean the womb cohering,</span>

						<span>The twisted skull waits, the watery or rotten blood waits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The child of the glutton or venerealee waits long, and the child of the drunkard waits long, and the drunkard himself waits long,</span>

						<span>The sleepers that lived and died wait, the far advanced are to go on in their turns, and the far behind are to come on in their turns,</span>

						<span>I too pass from the night,</span>

						<span>I stay a while away O night, but I return to you again and love you.</span>

					<span>I do not doubt that from under the feet and beside the hands and face I am cognizant of, are now looking faces I am not cognizant of, calm and actual faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt but the majesty and beauty of the world are latent in any iota of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt I am limitless, and that the universes are limitless, in vain I try to think how limitless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt that the orbs and the systems of orbs play their swift sports through the air on purpose, and that I shall one day be eligible to do as much as they, and more than they,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt that temporary affairs keep on and on millions of years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt interiors have their interiors, and exteriors have their exteriors, and that the eyesight has another eyesight, and the hearing another hearing, and the voice another voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt that the passionately-wept deaths of young men are provided for, and that the deaths of young women and the deaths of little children are provided for,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(Did you think Life was so well provided for, and Death, the purport of all Life, is not well provided for?)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt that wrecks at sea, no matter what the horrors of them, no matter whose wife, child, husband, father, lover, has gone down, are provided for, to the minutest points,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not doubt that whatever can possibly happen anywhere at any time, is provided for in the inherences of things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think Life provides for all and for Time and Space, but I believe Heavenly Death provides for all.</span>

					<span>Quicksand years that whirl me I know not whither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your schemes, politics, fail, lines give way, substances mock and elude me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only the theme I sing, the great and strong-possess’d soul, eludes not,</span>

					<span>One’s-self must never give way⁠—that is the final substance⁠—that out of all is sure,</span>

					<span>That music always round me, unceasing, unbeginning, yet long untaught I did not hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now the chorus I hear and am elated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A tenor, strong, ascending with power and health, with glad notes of daybreak I hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A soprano at intervals sailing buoyantly over the tops of immense waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A transparent base shuddering lusciously under and through the universe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The triumphant tutti, the funeral wailings with sweet flutes and violins, all these I fill myself with,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I hear not the volumes of sound merely, I am moved by the exquisite meanings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I listen to the different voices winding in and out, striving, contending with fiery vehemence to excel each other in emotion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think the performers know themselves⁠—but now I think I begin to know them.</span>

					<span>You are to die⁠—let others tell you what they please, I cannot prevaricate,</span>

					<span>Night on the prairies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The supper is over, the fire on the ground burns low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wearied emigrants sleep, wrapt in their blankets;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I walk by myself⁠—I stand and look at the stars, which I think now I never realized before.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Now I absorb immortality and peace,</span>

					<span>I admire death and test propositions.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How plenteous! how spiritual! how résumé!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same old man and soul⁠—the same old aspirations, and the same content.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>I was thinking the day most splendid till I saw what the not-day exhibited,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was thinking this globe enough till there sprang out so noiseless around me myriads of other globes.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Now while the great thoughts of space and eternity fill me I will measure myself by them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now touch’d with the lives of other globes arrived as far along as those of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or waiting to arrive, or pass’d on farther than those of the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I henceforth no more ignore them than I ignore my own life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or the lives of the earth arrived as far as mine, or waiting to arrive.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>O I see now that life cannot exhibit all to me, as the day cannot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see that I am to wait for what will be exhibited by death.</span>

					<span>To my mind, (whence it comes I know not,) spectral in mist of a wreck at sea,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of the solemn and murky mystery about the fate of the President,</span>

					<span>Of the flower of the marine science of fifty generations founder’d off the Northeast coast and going down⁠—of the steamship Arctic going down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the veil’d tableau⁠—women gather’d together on deck, pale, heroic, waiting the moment that draws so close⁠—O the moment!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A huge sob⁠—a few bubbles⁠—the white foam spirting up⁠—and then the women gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sinking there while the passionless wet flows on⁠—and I now pondering, Are those women indeed gone?</span>
