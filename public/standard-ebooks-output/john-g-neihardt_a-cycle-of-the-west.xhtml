				<h3 epub:type="title">Note</h3>
				<p>The following narrative is based upon an episode taken from that much neglected portion of our history, the era of the American Fur Trade. My interest in that period may be said to have begun at the age of six when, clinging to the forefinger of my father, I discovered the Missouri River from a bluff top at Kansas City. It was flood time, and the impression I received was deep and lasting. Even now I cannot think of that stream without a thrill of awe and something of the reverence one feels for mighty things. It was for me what the sea must have been to the Greek boys of antiquity. And as those ancient boys must have been eager to hear of perils nobly encountered on the deep and in the lands adjacent, so was I eager to learn of the heroes who had travelled my river as an imperial road. Nor was I disappointed in what I learned of them; for they seemed to me in every way equal to the heroes of old. I came to think of them with a sense of personal ownership, for any one of many of them might have been my grandfather⁠—and so a little of their purple fell on me. As I grew older and came to possess more of my inheritance, I began to see that what had enthralled me was, in fact, of the stuff of sagas, a genuine epic cycle in the rough. Furthermore, I realized that this raw material had been undergoing a process of digestion in my consciousness, corresponding in a way to the process of infinite repetition and fond elaboration which, as certain scholars tell us, foreran the heroic narratives of old time.</p>
				<p>I decided that some day I would begin to tell these hero tales in verse; and in 1908, as a preparation for what I had in mind, I descended the Missouri in an open boat, and also ascended the Yellowstone for a considerable distance. On the upper river the country was practically unchanged; and for one familiar with what had taken place there, it was no difficult feat of the imagination to revive the details of that time⁠—the men, the trails, the boats, the trading posts where veritable satraps once ruled under the sway of the American Fur Company.</p>
				<p>The Hugh Glass episode is to be found in Chittenden’s “History of the American Fur Trade” where it is quoted from its three printed sources: the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Missouri Intelligencer</i>, Sage’s “Scenes in the Rocky Mountains,” and Cooke’s “Scenes in the United States Army.” The present narrative begins after that military fiasco known as the Leavenworth Campaign against the Aricaras, which took place at the mouth of the Grand River in what is now South Dakota.</p>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Introduction</h3>
				<p>If the average student of Western American History in our schools were asked to recall those names which loom large for him during the four decades from the purchase of the Louisiana Territory to the coming of the settlers, he would doubtless think of Lewis and Clark, Lieutenant Pike, Major Long, and General Frémont, with perhaps one or two others. That is to say, the average student of Western History is familiar with the names of official explorers; and but for their exploits, those forty wonderful years would seem to him little more than a lapse of empty time in a vast region waiting for the westering white man.</p>
				<p>It is true that the deeds of those above named were important. The journey of Lewis and Clark from <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis to the mouth of the Columbia, and back again, has immense significance in the story of our national life, and it was truly a “magnificent adventure,” to use the phrase of Emerson Hough. Pike holds and deserves a high place for his explorations in the Southwest. Long’s contribution to the early knowledge of the West was considerable; and Frémont’s expeditions served, at least, to awaken the popular Eastern mind to the great possibilities of the Trans-Missouri region. Frémont’s reputation, however, is out of all proportion to his real accomplishment, for the trails he travelled were well known to white men long before he ventured into the wilderness. In this connection, Major Chittenden, one of the foremost authorities on the subject, tells us that “there never has been a time until very recently when the geography of the West was so thoroughly understood as it was by the trader and trapper from 1830 to 1840.”</p>
				<p>When Lewis and Clark were descending the Missouri River in the summer of 1806 on their return from the mouth of the Columbia, they met bands of traders pushing on toward the country from whence the explorers had just come. These were the vanguard of the real history makers of the Early West. It was such men as these who, during the next generation, as Chittenden says, “first explored and established the routes of travel which are now and always will be the avenues of commerce in that region.” The period that followed the return of Lewis and Clark was one of the most enthralling in the entire story of the human race, and yet the very names of its principal heroes are practically unknown except to specialists in Western History. The stories of their exploits have not yet reached our schools, and are to be found, for the most part, hidden away in the collections of state historical societies and in contemporary journals and books of travel long since out of print. The Mormon Emigration, the Mexican War, the Gold Rush to California, and the Oregon Question filled the popular imagination during the early years of the West, and thus an important phase of our national development was overlooked and forgotten.</p>
				<p>Nevertheless, it remains true that the story of the West during the first four decades of the nineteenth century is the story of the wandering bands of trappers and traders who explored the wilderness in search of furs from the British boundary to Mexico and from the Missouri to the Pacific. History, as written in the past, has been too much a chronological record of official governmental acts, too little an intimate account of the lives of the people themselves. Doubtless, the democratic spirit that now seems to be sweeping the world will, if it continues to spread, revolutionize our whole conception of history, bringing us to realize that the glory of the race is not the glory of a chosen few, but that it radiates from the precious heroic stuff of common human lives. And that view, I am proud to say, is quite in keeping with our dearest national traditions.</p>
				<p>Now the fur trade on the Missouri River dates well back into the eighteenth century, and at the time of the Revolutionary War, parties of trappers had already ascended as far north as the Big Bend in the present state of South Dakota. But it was not until after the return of Lewis and Clark from the Northwest, and of Lieutenant Pike from the Southwest, that the great era of the fur trade began. In 1807 the Spanish trader, Manuel Lisa, ascended the Missouri and the Yellowstone to the mouth of the Big Horn, where he erected a trading post. Returning to <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis the next year, he became the leading spirit in the “<abbr>St.</abbr> Louis Missouri Fur Company,” the troubled career of which, during the succeeding fifteen years, was rich in the stuff of which epics are made. Major Andrew Henry, who appears in “The Song of Hugh Glass” as leader of the westbound expedition from the mouth of the Grand River, was a member of that company, ascending the Missouri to the Three Forks in the summer of 1809. Driven thence by the Blackfeet, he crossed the Great Divide and built a post on what has since been called Henry’s fork of the Snake River, thus being the first American trader to operate on the Pacific side of the Rockies.</p>
				<p>In the spring of 1811, the Overland Astorians, under the command of <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W. P.</abbr> Hunt, left <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis, bound for the mouth of the Columbia where they expected to join forces with a sea expedition that had set sail from New York during the previous autumn for the long and hazardous voyage around Cape Horn. This is the only widely known expedition in the whole history of the Trans-Missouri fur trade, thanks to Washington Irving, whose account of it is an American classic.</p>
				<p>During the War of 1812 the fur trade on the Missouri declined; and though in the year 1819 five companies of some importance were operating from <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis, none of these was doing a profitable business. The revival of the trade, which ushered in the great epic period of our national development, may be dated from March 20th, 1822, when the following advertisement appeared in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Missouri Republican</i> of <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>To Enterprising Young Men:</p>
					<p>The subscriber wishes to engage one hundred young men to ascend the Missouri River to its source, there to be employed for one, two or three years. For particulars enquire of Major Andrew Henry, near the lead mines in the County of Washington, who will ascend with and command the party; or of the subscriber near <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis.</p>

				</blockquote>
				<p>Major Henry has already been mentioned as a veteran trader of the upper country. Ashley, who was at that time General of the Missouri Militia and Lieutenant Governor of the recently admitted state, was about to make his first trip into the wilderness.</p>
				<p>Setting out in the spring of 1822, Major Henry, with his one hundred “enterprising young men” (some of whom were young only in spirit), ascended to the mouth of the Yellowstone. This was before the era of the Missouri River steamboat, and the two keelboats, that bore the trading stock and supplies of the party, were “cordelled,” that is to say, pulled by towline. General Ashley accompanied the expedition, returning to <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis in the fall. Early in the spring of 1823 he started north again with a second band of one hundred men. Stopping to trade for horses at the Ree villages near the mouth of the Grand, he was attacked by that most treacherous of the Missouri River tribes, received a sound drubbing, lost most of his horses, and was compelled to drop down stream to await reinforcements. It was in this battle that old Hugh Glass received his hip wound.</p>
				<p>Jedediah Smith, who was a member of the defeated party, and who had fought with conspicuous bravery, volunteered to carry the news of disaster to Henry at the mouth of the Yellowstone. He was then but twenty-four years old; yet during the next six years he was destined to discover and explore the central and southwestern routes to the Pacific⁠—an achievement of equal importance with that of Lewis and Clark, and performed under much greater difficulties. Immediately upon the arrival of Smith at the mouth of the Yellowstone, Henry, with most of his band, started south to the relief of Ashley.</p>
				<p>In the meanwhile, Ashley had apprised the Indian Agent and military authorities at Fort Atkinson of his rough treatment; and Colonel Leavenworth started north with 220 men, intent upon chastising the Rees and making the Missouri River safe for American traders. The campaign that followed, in which the Whites were aided by a band of Sioux, was in some important respects a fiasco, as the opening lines of the poem suggest. But that does not greatly matter here.</p>
				<p>What does matter, is the fact that the muster roll of the two parties of Ashley and Henry, then united at the mouth of the Grand, contained nearly all of the great names in the history of the West from the time of Lewis and Clark to the coming of the settlers. Harrison Clifford Dale, whose “Ashley-Smith Explorations to the Pacific” easily ranks him as the supreme authority on this particular period, has the following to say regarding the Ashley-Henry men: “The wanderings of this group during the next ten or fifteen years cover the entire West.⁠ ⁠… It was the most significant group of continental explorers ever brought together.”</p>
				<p>After the Leavenworth campaign against the Rees, Major Henry, with eighty men, set out for the mouth of the Big Horn by way of the Grand River valley. Hugh Glass acted as hunter for the westbound party, and it is at this point that the following narrative begins. Old Glass was not himself an explorer, yet his adventures serve to illustrate the heroic temper of the men who explored the West, as well as the nature of the difficulties they encountered.</p>
				<p>In building the epic cycle, of which “The Song of Hugh Glass” and “The Song of Three Friends” are parts (each, however, being complete in itself), I am concerned with the wanderings of that group of men who were assembled for the last time at the mouth of the Grand. Long ago, when I was younger than most of you who are now about to study the poem here presented, I dreamed of making those men live again for the young men and women of my country. The tremendous mood of heroism that was developed in our American West during that period is properly a part of your racial inheritance; and certainly no less important a part than the memory of ancient heroes. Indeed, it can be shown that those men⁠—Kentuckians, Virginians, Pennsylvanians, Ohioans⁠—were direct descendants, in the epic line, of all the heroes of our Aryan race that have been celebrated by the poets of the Past; descendants of Achilles and Hector, of Aeneas, of Roland, of Sigurd, and of the knights of Arthur’s court. They went as torchbearers in the van of our westering civilization. Your Present is, in a great measure, a heritage from their Past.</p>
				<p>And their blood is in your veins!</p>

						<p epub:type="title">Graybeard and Goldhair</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>The year was eighteen hundred twenty three.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas when the guns that blustered at the Ree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had ceased to brag, and ten score martial clowns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned from the unwhipped Aricara towns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Earning the scornful laughter of the Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A withering blast the arid South still blew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And creeks ran thin beneath the glaring sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twas a month ere honking geese would fly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Southward before the Great White Hunter’s face:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many generations of their race,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As bow-flung arrows, now have fallen spent.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It happened then that Major Henry went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With eighty trappers up the dwindling Grand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bound through the weird, unfriending barren-land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For where the Big Horn meets the Yellowstone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And old Hugh Glass went with them.</span>
							<span>Large of bone,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep-chested, that his great heart might have play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray-bearded, gray of eye and crowned with gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was Glass. It seemed he never had been young;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, for the grudging habit of his tongue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None knew the place or season of his birth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slowly he ’woke to anger or to mirth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet none laughed louder when the rare mood fell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hate in him was like a still, white hell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thing of doom not lightly reconciled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What memory he kept of wife or child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was never told; for when his comrades sat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the evening fire with pipe and chat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exchanging talk of home and gentler days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old Hugh stared long upon the pictured blaze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what he saw went upward in the smoke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But once, as with an inner lightning stroke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The veil was rent, and briefly men discerned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What pent-up fires of selfless passion burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the still gray smoldering of him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was a rakehell lad, called Little Jim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jamie or Petit Jacques; for scarce began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The downy beard to mark him for a man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blue-eyed was he and femininely fair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A maiden might have coveted his hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That trapped the sunlight in its tangled skein:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, tardily, outflowered the wild blond strain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gutted Rome grown overfat in sloth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Ganymedes haunted by a Goth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was Jamie. When the restive ghost was laid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed some fancy-ridden child who played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At manliness ’mid all those bearded men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sternest heart was drawn to Jamie then.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But his one mood ne’er linked two hours together.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To schedule Jamie’s way, as prairie weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was to get fact by wedding doubt and whim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For very lightly slept that ghost in him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No cloudy brooding went before his wrath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, like a thunder-squall, recked not its path,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But raged upon what happened in its way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some called him brave who saw him on that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Ashley stormed a bluff town of the Ree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all save beardless Jamie turned to flee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For shelter from that steep, lead-harrowed slope.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, hardly courage, but blind rage agrope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inspired the foolish deed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">’Twas then old Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tore off the gray mask, and the heart shone through.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, halting in a dry, flood-guttered draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trappers rallied, looked aloft and saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That travesty of war against the sky.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of a breathless hush, the old man’s cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leaped shivering, an anguished cry and wild</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of some mother fearing for her child,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up the steep he went with mighty bounds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long afterward the story went the rounds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How old Glass fought that day. With gun for club,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grim as a grizzly fighting for a cub,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He laid about him, cleared the way, and so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Supported by the firing from below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought Jamie back. And when the deed was done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Taking the lad upon his knee: “My Son,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brave men are not ashamed to fear,” said Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“And I’ve a mind to make a man of you;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So here’s your first acquaintance with the law!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat he spanked the lad with vigorous paw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, having done so, limped away to bed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, wounded in the hip, the old man bled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It was a month before he hobbled out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie, like a fond son, hung about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old man’s tent and waited upon him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And often would the deep gray eyes grow dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gazing on the boy; and there would go⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though Spring-fire should waken out of snow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wistful light across that mask of gray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once Hugh smiled his enigmatic way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While poring long on Jamie’s face, and said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“So with their sons are women brought to bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Sore wounded!”</span>
							<span>Thus united were the two:</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some would dub the old man “Mother Hugh”;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While those in whom all living waters sank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To some dull inner pool that teemed and stank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With formless evil, into that morass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazed, and saw darkly there, as in a glass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The foul shape of some weakly envied sin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For each man builds a world and dwells therein.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor could these know what mocking ghost of Spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stirred Hugh’s gray world with dreams of blossoming</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That wooed no seed to swell or bird to sing.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So might a dawn-struck digit of the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dream back the rain of some old lunar June</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ache through all its craters to be green.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Little they know what life’s one love can mean,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who shrine it in a bower of peace and bliss:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pang dwelling in a puckered cicatrice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More truly figures this belated love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet very precious was the hurt thereof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grievous to bear, too dear to cast away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now Jamie went with Hugh; but who shall say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If ’twas a warm heart or a wind of whim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Love, or the rover’s teasing itch in him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moved Jamie? Howsoe’er, ’twas good to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Graybeard and Goldhair riding knee to knee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One age in young adventure. One who saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has likened to a February thaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh’s mellow mood those days; and truly so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For when the tempering Southwest wakes to blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A phantom April over melting snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep in the North some new white wrath is brewed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of a dim-trailed inner solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old man summoned many a stirring story,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lived grimly once, but now shot through with glory</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caught from the wondering eyes of him who heard⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tales jaggèd with the bleak unstudied word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stark saga-stuff. “A fellow that I knew,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So nameless went the hero that was Hugh⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mere pelt merchant, as it seemed to him;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet trailing epic thunders through the dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Whist world of Jamie’s awe.</span>
							<span>And so they went,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One heart, it seemed, and that heart well content</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With tale and snatch of song and careless laughter.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Never before, and surely never after,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gray old man seemed nearer to his youth⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That myth that somehow had to be the truth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet could not be convincing any more.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the days of travel numbered four</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nearer drew the barrens with their need,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Glass, the hunter, fell the task to feed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those four score hungers when the game should fail.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no young eye could trace so dim a trail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or line the rifle sights with speed so true.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor might the wistful Jamie go with Hugh;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“For,” so Hugh chaffed, “my trick of getting game</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might teach young eyes to put old eyes to shame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An old dog never risks his only bone.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Wolves prey in packs, the lion hunts alone”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is somewhat nearer what he should have meant.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so with merry jest the old man went;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so they parted at an unseen gate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That even then some gust of moody fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clanged to betwixt them; each a tale to spell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One in the nightmare scrawl of dreams from hell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One in the blistering trail of days a-crawl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Venomous footed. Nor might it ere befall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These two should meet in after days and be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Graybeard and Goldhair riding knee to knee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recounting with a bluff, heroic scorn</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>The haps of either tale.</span>
							<span>’Twas early morn</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Hugh went forth, and all day Jamie rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Henry’s men, while more and more the goad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of eager youth sore fretted him, and made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dusty progress of the cavalcade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The journey of a snail flock to the moon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the shadow-weaving afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned many fingers nightward⁠—then he fled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pricking his horse, nor deigned to turn his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At any dwindling voice of reprimand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For somewhere in the breaks along the Grand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surely Hugh waited with a goodly kill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hoofbeats of ghostly steeds on every hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mysterious, muffled hoofs on every bluff!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spurred echo horses clattering up the rough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confluent draws! These flying Jamie heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lagging air droned like the drowsy word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one who tells weird stories late at night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half headlong joy and half delicious fright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His day-dream’s pace outstripped the plunging steed’s.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lean galloper in a wind of splendid deeds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like Hugh’s, he seemed unto himself, until,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snorting, a-haunch above a breakneck hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horse stopped short⁠—then Jamie was aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of lonesome flatlands fading skyward there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath him, and, zigzag on either hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A purple haze denoted how the Grand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forked wide ’twixt sunset and the polar star.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A-tiptoe in the stirrups, gazing far,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw no Hugh nor any moving thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save for a welter of cawing crows, a-wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About some banquet in the further hush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One faint star, set above the fading blush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sunset, saw the coming night, and grew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hand for trumpet, Jamie gave halloo;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once again. For answer, the horse neighed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some vague mistrust now made him half afraid⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some formless dread that stirred beneath the will</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>As far as sleep from waking.</span>
							<span>Down the hill,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Close-footed in the skitter of the shale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spurred horse floundered to the solid vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And galloped to the northwest, whinnying.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The outstripped air moaned like a wounded thing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Jamie gave the lie unto his dread.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The old man’s camping out tonight,” he said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Somewhere about the forks, as like as not;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there’ll be hunks of fresh meat steaming hot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fighting stories by a dying fire!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sunset reared a luminous phantom spire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, crumbling, sifted ashes down the sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now, pausing, Jamie sent a searching cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the twilit river-skirting brush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the vast denial of the hush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The champing of the snaffled horse seemed loud.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then, startling as a voice beneath a shroud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A muffled boom woke somewhere up the stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like vague thunder hearkened in a dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drawled back to silence. Now, with heart abound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Keen for the quarter of the perished sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lad spurred gaily; for he doubted not</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His cry had brought Hugh’s answering rifle shot.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The laggard air was like a voice that sang,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie half believed he sniffed the tang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of woodsmoke and the smell of flesh a-roast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When presently before him, like a ghost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upstanding, huge in twilight, arms flung wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gray form loomed. The wise horse reared and shied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snorting his inborn terror of the bear!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the whirlwind of a moment there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betwixt the brute’s hoarse challenge and the charge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lad beheld, upon the grassy marge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of a small spring that bullberries stooped to scan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ragged heap that should have been a man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A huddled, broken thing⁠—and it was Hugh!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>There was no need for any closer view.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As, on the instant of a lightning flash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere yet the split gloom closes with a crash,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A landscape stares with every circumstance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rock and shrub⁠—just so the fatal chance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Hugh’s one shot, made futile with surprise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was clear to Jamie. Then before his eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The light whirled in a giddy dance of red;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, doubting not the crumpled thing was dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That was a friend, with but a skinning knife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would have striven for the hated life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That triumphed there: but with a shriek of fright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mad horse bolted through the falling night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie, fumbling at his rifle boot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard the brush crash behind him where the brute</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came headlong, close upon the straining flanks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when at length low-lying river banks⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White rubble in the gloaming⁠—glimmered near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A swift thought swept the mind of Jamie clear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of anger and of anguish for the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce seemed the raging beast a thing to dread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But some foul-playing braggart to outwit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now hurling all his strength upon the bit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sank the spurs, and with a groan of pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The plunging horse, obedient to the rein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swerved sharply streamward. Sliddering in the sand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bear shot past. And suddenly the Grand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loomed up beneath and rose to meet the pair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rode a moment upon empty air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then smote the water in a shower of spray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when again the slowly ebbing day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came back to them, a-drip from nose to flank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steed was scrambling up the further bank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie saw across the narrow stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some vague shape of fury in a dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The checked beast ramping at the water’s rim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doubt struggled with a victor’s thrill in him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As, hand to buckle of the rifle-sheath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thought of dampened powder; but beneath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rawhide flap the gun lay snug and dry.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then as the horse wheeled and the mark went by⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A patch of shadow dancing upon gray⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He fired. A sluggish thunder trailed away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spreading smoke-rack lifted slow, and there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Floundering in a seethe of foam, the bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugged yielding water for the foe that slew!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Triumphant, Jamie wondered what old Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would think of such a “trick of getting game”!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Young eyes” indeed!⁠—And then that memory came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like a dull blade thrust back into a wound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One moment ’twas as though the lad had swooned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into a dream-adventure, waking there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To sicken at the ghastly land, astare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some familiar face gone strange at last.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as the hot tears came, the moment passed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Song snatches, broken tales⁠—a troop forlorn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like merry friends of eld come back to mourn⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’erwhelmed him there. And when the black bulk churned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The star-flecked stream no longer, Jamie turned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recrossed the river and rode back to Hugh.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A burning twist of valley grasses threw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blear light about the region of the spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then Jamie, torch aloft and shuddering,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knelt there beside his friend, and moaned: “O Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If I had been with you⁠—just been with you!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We might be laughing now⁠—and you are dead.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gentle hand he turned the hoary head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he might see the good gray face again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The torch burned out, the dark swooped back, and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His grief was frozen with an icy plunge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In horror. ’Twas as though a bloody sponge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had wiped the pictured features from a slate!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, pillaged by an army drunk with hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Home stares upon the homing refugee.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A red gout clung where either brow should be;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The haughty nose lay crushed amid the beard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thick with slow ooze, whence like a devil leered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The battered mouth convulsed into a grin.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nor did the darkness cover, for therein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some torch, unsnuffed, with blear funereal flare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still painted upon black that alien stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the lad more terribly alone.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then in the gloom there rose a broken moan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quick stifled; and it seemed that something stirred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the body. Doubting that he heard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lad felt, with a panic catch of breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pale vagrants from the legendry of death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Potential in the shadows there. But when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The motion and the moaning came again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hope, like a shower at daybreak, cleansed the dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the lad’s heart something like a lark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sang morning. Bending low, he crooned: “Hugh, Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It’s Jamie⁠—don’t you know?⁠—I’m here with you.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As one who in a nightmare strives to tell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shouting across the gap of some dim hell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What things assail him; so it seemed Hugh heard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flung some unintelligible word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Athwart the muffling distance of his swoon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now kindled by the yet unrisen moon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The East went pale; and like a naked thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little wind ran vexed and shivering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the dusk, till Jamie shivered too</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And worried lest ’twere bitter cold where Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung clutching at the bleak, raw edge of life.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Jamie rose, and with his hunting-knife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Split wood and built a fire. Nor did he fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The staring face now, for he found it dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With the warm presence of a friend returned.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fire made cozy chatter as it burned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reared a tent of light in that lone place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then Jamie set about to bathe the face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With water from the spring, oft crooning low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“It’s Jamie here beside you⁠—don’t you know?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet came no answer save the labored breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one who wrestled mightily with Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where watched no referee to call the foul.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The moon now cleared the world’s end, and the owl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave voice unto the wizardry of light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While in some dim-lit chancel of the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snouts to the goddess, wolfish corybants</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intoned their wild antiphonary chants⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The oldest, saddest worship in the world.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And Jamie watched until the firelight swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Softly about him. Sound and glimmer merged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make an eerie void, through which he urged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With frantic spur some whirlwind of a steed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made the way as glass beneath his speed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet scarce kept pace with something dear that fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On, ever on⁠—just half a dream ahead:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until it seemed, by some vague shape dismayed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He cried aloud for Hugh, and the steed neighed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A neigh that was a burst of light, not sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie, sprawling on the dewy ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knew that his horse was sniffing at his hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While, mumbling through the early morning air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came a roll of many hoofs⁠—and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw the swinging troop of Henry’s men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-canter up the valley with the sun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Of all Hugh’s comrades crowding round, not one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But would have given heavy odds on Death;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, though the graybeard fought with sobbing breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No man, it seemed, might break upon the hip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So stern a wrestler with the strangling grip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made the neck veins like a purple thong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tangled with knots. Nor might Hugh tarry long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There where the trail forked outward far and dim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or so it seemed. And when they lifted him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His moan went treble like a song of pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He was so tortured. Surely it were vain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hope he might endure the toilsome ride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the barrens. Better let him bide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There on the grassy couch beside the spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, furthermore, it seemed a foolish thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That eighty men should wait the issue there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For dying is a game of solitaire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all men play the losing hand alone.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when at noon he had not ceased to moan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fought still like the strong man he had been,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There grew a vague mistrust that he might win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all this be a tale for wondering ears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Major Henry called for volunteers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two men among the eighty who would stay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wait on Glass and keep the wolves away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until he did whatever he should do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All quite agreed ’twas bitter bread for Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet none, save Jamie, felt in duty bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To run the risk⁠—until the hat went round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pity wakened, at the silver’s clink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Jules Le Bon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">“He would not have them think</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That mercenary motives prompted him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But somehow just the grief of Little Jim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was quite sufficient⁠—not to mention Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He weighed the risk. As everybody knew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Rickarees were scattered to the West:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The late campaign had stirred a hornet’s nest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fill the land with stingers (which was so),</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And yet⁠—”</span>
							<span>Three days a southwest wind may blow</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>False April with no drop of dew at heart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Jules ran on, while, ready for the start,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pawing horses nickered and the men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Impatient in their saddles, yawned. And then,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brief advice, a round of bluff goodbyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some few reassuring backward cries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troop rode up the valley with the day.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Intent upon his friend, with naught to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat Jamie; while Le Bon discussed at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The reasonable limits of man’s strength⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A self-conducted dialectic strife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made absurd all argument for life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And granted but a fresh-dug hole for Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas half like murder. Yet it seemed Jules knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unnumbered tales accordant with the case,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each circumstantial as to time and place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And furnished with a death’s head colophon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Vivaciously despondent, Jules ran on.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Did he not share his judgment with the rest?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You see, ’twas some contusion of the chest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That did the trick⁠—heart, lungs and all that, mixed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In such a way they never could be fixed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>A bear’s hug⁠—ugh!”</span>
							<span>And often Jamie winced</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At some knife-thrust of reason that convinced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet left him sick with unrelinquished hope.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who in a darkened room might grope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For some belovèd face, with shuddering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anticipation of a clammy thing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So in the lad’s heart sorrow fumbled round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For some old joy to lean upon, and found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stark, cold something Jamie knew was there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, womanlike, he stroked the hoary hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or bathed the face; while Jules found tales to tell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Lugubriously garrulous.</span>
							<span>Night fell.</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At sundown, daylong winds are like to veer;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, summoning a mood of relished fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Le Bon remembered dire alarms by night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The swoop of savage hordes, the desperate fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of men outnumbered: and, like him of old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all that made Jules shudder as he told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His the great part⁠—a man by field and flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fate-tossed. Upon the gloom he limned in blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their situation’s possibilities:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two men against the fury of the Rees⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A game in which two hundred men had failed!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He pointed out how little it availed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To run the risk for one as good as dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, Jules Le Bon meant every word he said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had a scalp to lose, if need should be.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That night through Jamie’s dreaming swarmed the Ree.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray-souled, he wakened to a dawn of gray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And felt that something strong had gone away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor knew what thing. Some whisper of the will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bade him rejoice that Hugh was living still;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Hugh, the real, seemed somehow otherwhere.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules, snug and snoring in his blanket there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was half a life the nearer. Just so, pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is nearer than the peace we seek in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by its very sting compels belief.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules woke, and with a fine restraint of grief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw early dissolution. “One more night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the poor old man would lose the fight⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Ah, such a man!”</span>
							<span>A day and night crept by,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet the stubborn fighter would not die,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But grappled with the angel. All the while,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With some conviction, but with more of guile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules colonized the vacancy with Rees;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till Jamie felt that looseness of the knees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That comes of oozing courage. Many men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May tower for a white-hot moment, when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wild blood surges at a sudden shock;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when, insistent as a ticking clock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blind peril haunts and whispers, fewer dare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dread hovered in the hushed and moony air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long night through; nor might a fire be lit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest some far-seeing foe take note of it.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And daylong Jamie scanned the blank sky rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For hoof-flung dust clouds; till there woke in him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A childish anger⁠—dumb for ruth and shame⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>That Hugh so dallied.</span>
							<span>But the fourth dawn came</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with it lulled the fight, as on a field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where broken armies sleep but will not yield.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or had one conquered? Was it Hugh or Death?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old man breathed with faintly fluttering breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did his body shudder as before.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules triumphed sadly. “It would soon be o’er;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So men grew quiet when they lost their grip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And did not care. At sundown he would slip</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Into the deeper silence.”</span>
							<span>Jamie wept,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwitting how a furtive gladness crept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into his heart that gained a stronger beat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So cities, long beleaguered, take defeat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Unto themselves half traitors.</span>
							<span>Jules began</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To dig a hole that might conceal a man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as his sheath knife broke the stubborn sod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He spoke in kindly vein of Life and God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Mutability and Rectitude.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The immemorial funerary mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought tears, mute tribute to the mother-dust;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie, seeing, felt each cutting thrust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less like a stab into the flesh of Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun crept up and down the arc of blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through the air a chill of evening ran;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, though the grave yawned, waiting for the man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man seemed scarce yet ready for the grave.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now prompted by a coward or a knave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lurked in him, Le Bon began to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Faint sounds that to the lad’s less cunning ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were silence; more like tremors of the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They were, Jules said, than any proper sound⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus one detected horsemen miles away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For many moments big with fate, he lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ear pressed to earth; then rose and shook his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one perplexed. “There’s something wrong,” he said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And⁠—as at daybreak whiten winter skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Agape and staring with a wild surmise⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lad’s face whitened at the other’s word.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules could not quite interpret what he heard;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hundred horse might noise their whereabouts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In just that fashion; yet he had his doubts.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It could be bison moving, quite as well.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But if ’twere Rees⁠—there’d be a tale to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That two men he might name should never hear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He reckoned scalps that Fall were selling dear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In keeping with the limited supply.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men, fit to live, were not afraid to die!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then, in that caution suits not courage ill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules saddled up and cantered to the hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A white dam set against the twilight stream;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as a horseman riding in a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lad beheld him; watched him clamber up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the dusk, as from a brimming cup,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran over; saw him pause against the gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Portentous, huge⁠—a brooder upon doom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>What did he look upon?</span>
							<span>Some moments passed;</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly it seemed as though a blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wind, keen-cutting with the whips of sleet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smote horse and rider. Haunched on huddled feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steed shrank from the ridge, then, rearing, wheeled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took the rubbly incline fury-heeled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Those days and nights, like seasons creeping slow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had told on Jamie. Better blow on blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of evil hap, with doom seen clear ahead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than that monotonous, abrasive dread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blind gnawer at the soul-thews of the blind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thin-worn, the last heart-string that held him kind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strung taut, the final tie that kept him true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now snapped in Jamie, as he saw the two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So goaded by some terrifying sight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Death riding with the vanguard of the Night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Life dwindling yonder with the rear of Day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What choice for one whom panic swept away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From moorings in the sanity of will?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Jules came and summed the vision of the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In one hoarse cry that left no word to say:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Rees! Saddle up! We’ve got to get away!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Small wit had Jamie left to ferret guile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But fumblingly obeyed Le Bon; the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jules knelt beside the man who could not flee:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For big hearts lack not time for charity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>However thick the blows of fate may fall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, in that Jules Le Bon was practical,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could not quite ignore a hunting knife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flint, a gun, a blanket⁠—gear of life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce suited to the customs of the dead!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And Hugh slept soundly in his ample bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Star-canopied and blanketed with night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwitting how Venality and Fright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made hot the westward trail of Henry’s men.</span>

						<p epub:type="title">The Awakening</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>No one may say what time elapsed, or when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slumberous shadow lifted over Hugh:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But some globose immensity of blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enfolded him at last, within whose light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed to float, as some faint swimmer might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A deep beneath and overhead a deep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So one late plunged into the lethal sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spirit diver fighting for his breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swoops through the many-fathomed glooms of death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Emerging in a daylight strange and new.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Rousing a languid wonder, came on Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The quiet, steep-arched splendor of the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Agrope for some dim memory, he lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his back, and watched a lucent fleece</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fade in the blue profundity of peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As did the memory he sought in vain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then with a stirring of mysterious pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old habit of the body bade him rise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when he would obey, the hollow skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Broke as a bubble punctured, and went out.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Again he woke, and with a drowsy doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remote unto his horizontal gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw the world’s end kindle to a blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up the smoky steep pale heralds run.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when at length he knew it for the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dawn found the darkling reaches of his mind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where in the twilight he began to find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strewn shards and torsos of familiar things.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from the rubble in a place of kings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men school the dream to build the past anew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So out of dream and fragment builded Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And came upon the reason of his plight:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bear’s attack⁠—the shot⁠—and then the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein men talked as ghosts above a grave.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some consciousness of will the memory gave:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would get up. The painful effort spent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made the wide heavens billow as a tent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wind-struck, the shaken prairie sag and roll.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some moments with an effort at control</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He swayed, half raised upon his arms, until</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dizzy cosmos righted, and was still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then would he stand erect and be again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man he was: an overwhelming pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smote him to earth, and one unruly limb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Refused the weight and crumpled under him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Sickened with torture he lay huddled there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazing about him with a great despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proportioned to the might that felt the chain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far-flung as dawn, collusive sky and plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Stared bleak denial back.</span>
							<span>Why strive at all?⁠—</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That vacancy about him like a wall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yielding as light, a granite scarp to climb!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some little waiting on the creep of time,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abandonment to circumstance; and then⁠—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Here flashed a sudden thought of Henry’s men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into his mind and drove the gloom away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They would be riding westward with the day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How strange he had forgot! That battered leg</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or some scalp wound, had set his wits a-beg!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was this Hugh Glass to whimper like a squaw?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grimly amused, he raised his head and saw⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The empty distance: listened long and heard⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Naught but the twitter of a lonely bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>That emphasized the hush.</span>
							<span>Was something wrong?</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas not the Major’s way to dally long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And surely they had camped not far behind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now woke a query in his troubled mind⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where was his horse? Again came creeping back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The circumstances of the bear’s attack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had dismounted, thinking at the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To spend the night⁠—and then the grisly thing⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of course the horse had bolted; plain enough!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But why was all the soil about so rough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though a herd of horses had been there?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The riddle vexed him till his vacant stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell on a heap of earth beside a pit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What did that mean? He wormed his way to it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The newly wakened wonder dulling pain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No paw of beast had scooped it⁠—that was plain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas squared; indeed, ’twas like a grave, he thought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A grave⁠—a grave⁠—the mental echo wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sick fancies! Who had risen from the dead?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, lying there, had heard above his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ghostly talkers deaf unto his shout?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now searching all the region round about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the answer were a lurking thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw along the margin of the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An ash-heap and the litter of a camp.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suspicion, like a little smoky lamp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That daubs the murk but cannot fathom it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung blear grotesques before his groping wit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had Rees been there? And he alive? Who then?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And were he dead, it might be Henry’s men!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many suns had risen while he slept?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smoky glow flared wildly, and he crept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dragged limb throbbing, till at length he found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trail of many horses westward bound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in one breath the groping light became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gloom-devouring ecstasy of flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dazing conflagration of belief!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Plunged deeper than the seats of hate and grief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gazed about for aught that might deny</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such baseness: saw the non-committal sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie apathetic in a shroud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bland complacence of a vagrant cloud⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Worldwide connivance! Smilingly the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Approved a land wherein such deeds were done;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And careless breezes, like a troop of youth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unawed before the presence of such truth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went scampering amid the tousled brush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then bye and bye came on him with a rush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His weakness and the consciousness of pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While, with the chill insistence of a rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That pelts the sodden wreck of Summer’s end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His manifest betrayal by a friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beat in upon him. Jamie had been there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie⁠—Jamie⁠—Jamie did not care!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What no man yet had witnessed, the wide sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked down and saw; a light wind idling by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard what no ear of mortal yet had heard:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he⁠—whose name was like a magic word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To conjure the remote heroic mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of valiant deed and splendid fortitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherever two that shared a fire might be⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave way to grief and wept unmanfully.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet not as they for whom tears fall like dew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To green a frosted heart again, wept Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So thewed to strive, so engined to prevail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make harsh fate the zany of a tale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>His own might shook and tore him.</span>
							<span>For a span</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He lay, a gray old ruin of a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all his years upon him like a snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then at length, as from the long ago,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remote beyond the other side of wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old love came like some remembered song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereof the strain is sweet, the burden sad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A retrospective vision of the lad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew up in him, as in a foggy night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The witchery of semilunar light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mysteriously quickens all the air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some memory of wind-blown golden hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The boyish laugh, the merry eyes of blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrought marvelously in the heart of Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As under snow the daemon of the Spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And momently it seemed a little thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To suffer; nor might treachery recall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The miracle of being loved at all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The privilege of loving to the end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thereupon a longing for his friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made life once more a struggle for a prize⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To look again upon the merry eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see again the wind-blown golden hair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, one should lavish very tender care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the vessel of a hope so great,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest it be shattered, and the precious freight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As water on the arid waste, poured out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet, though he longed to live, a subtle doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still turned on him the weapon of his pain:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now, as before, collusive sky and plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outstared his purpose for a puny thing.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Praying to live, he crawled back to the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With something in his heart like gratitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That by good luck his gun might furnish food,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His blanket, shelter, and his flint, a fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, after all, what thing do men desire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be or have, but these condition it?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These with a purpose and a little wit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And howsoever smitten, one might rise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Push back the curtain of the curving skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And come upon the living dream at last.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Exhausted, by the spring he lay and cast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dull eyes about him. What did it portend?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Naught but the footprints of a fickle friend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A yawning grave and ashes met his eyes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce feeling yet the shock of a surprise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He searched about him for his flint and knife;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knew vaguely that his seeking was for life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that the place was empty where he sought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No food, no fire, no shelter! Dully wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bleak negation in him, slowly crept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where, despite the pain, his love had kept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shrine for Jamie undefiled of doubt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly conviction, like a shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused him. Jamie⁠—Jamie was a thief!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The very difficulty of belief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was fuel for the simmering of rage;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That grew and grew, the more he strove to gage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The underlying motive of the deed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Untempered youth might fail a friend in need;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But here had wrought some devil of the will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some heartless thing, too cowardly to kill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That left to Nature what it dared not do!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So bellowsed, all the kindled soul of Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Became a still white hell of brooding ire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through his veins regenerating fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran, driving out the lethargy of pain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now once again he scanned the yellow plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conspirant with the overbending skies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo, the one was blue as Jamie’s eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other of the color of his hair⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Twin hues of falseness merging to a stare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though such guilt, thus visibly immense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Regarded its effect with insolence!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Alas for those who fondly place above</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The act of loving, what they chance to love;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who prize the goal more dearly than the way!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For time shall plunder them, and change betray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And life shall find them vulnerable still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A bitter-sweet narcotic to the will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh’s love increased the peril of his plight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But anger broke the slumber of his might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quickened the heart and warmed the blood that ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defiance for the treachery of Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defiance for the meaning of his pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defiance for the distance of the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed to gloat, “You can not master me.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for one burning moment he felt free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rise and conquer in a wind of rage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as a tiger, conscious of the cage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-smoulder with a purpose, broods and waits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So with the sullen patience that is hate’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh taught his wrath to bide expedience.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now cognizant of every quickened sense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thirst came upon him. Leaning to the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stared with fascination on a thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rose from giddy deeps to share the draught⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A face, it was, so tortured that it laughed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ghastly mask that Murder well might wear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while as one they drank together there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was as though the deed he meant to do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took shape and came to kiss the lips of Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest that revenge might falter. Hunger woke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the bush with leafage gray as smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein like flame the bullberries glinted red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Scarce sweeter than the heart of him they fed),</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Hugh feasted.</span>
							<span>And the hours of waiting crept,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-gloom, a-glow; and though he waked or slept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pondered purpose or a dream that wrought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By night, the murder of his waking thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sustained him till he felt his strength returned.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then at length the longed-for morning burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beckoned down the vast way he should crawl⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That waste to be surmounted as a wall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sky-rims and yet more sky-rims steep to climb⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That simulacrum of enduring Time⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hundred empty miles ’twixt him and where</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>The stark Missouri ran!</span>
							<span>Yet why not dare?</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite the useless leg, he could not die</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One hairsbreadth farther from the earth and sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or more remote from kindness.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i17">Straight away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the flare of dawn, the Ree land lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through it ran the short trail to the goal.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thereon a grim turnpikeman waited toll:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ’twas so doomed that southering geese should flee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nine times, ere yet the vengeance of the Ree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should make their foe the haunter of a tale.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Midway to safety on the northern trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scoriac region of a hell burned black</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forbade the crawler. And for all his lack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh had no heart to journey with the suns:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No suppliant unto those faithless ones</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should bid for pity at the Big Horn’s mouth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The greater odds for safety in the South</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Allured him; so he felt the midday sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blaze down the coulee of a little run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dwindled upward to the watershed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereon the feeders of the Moreau head⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce more than deep-carved runes of vernal rain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trailing leg was like a galling chain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bound him to a doubt that would not pass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defiant clumps of thirst-embittered grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That bit parched earth with bared and fang-like roots;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dwarf thickets, jealous for their stunted fruits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Harsh-tempered by their disinheritance⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These symbolized the enmity of Chance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For him who, with his fate unreconciled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Equipped for travel as a weanling child,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Essayed the journey of a mighty man.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Like agitated oil the heat-waves ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made the scabrous gulch appear to shake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As some reflected landscape in a lake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where laggard breezes move. A taunting reek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose from the grudging seepage of the creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereof Hugh drank and drank, and still would drink.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where the mottled shadow dripped as ink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From scanty thickets on the yellow glare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crawler faltered with no heart to dare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again the torture of that toil, until</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The master-thought of vengeance ’woke the will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To goad him forth. And when the sun quiesced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid ironic heavens in the West⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The region of false friends⁠—Hugh gained a rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence to the fading cincture of the skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A purpling panorama swept away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce farther than a shout might carry, lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The place of his betrayal. He could see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The yellow blotch of earth where treachery</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had digged his grave. O futile wrath and toil!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tucked in beneath yon coverlet of soil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned back for him, how soundly had he slept!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fool, fool! to struggle when he might have crept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So short a space, yet farther than the flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of swiftest dreaming through the longest night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the quiet house of no false friend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Alas for those who seek a journey’s end⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They have it ever with them like a ghost:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor shall they find, who deem they seek it most,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But crave the end of human ends⁠—as Hugh.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now swoopingly the world of dream broke through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The figured wall of sense. It seemed he ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wind above the creeping ways of man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And came upon the place of his desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where burned, far-luring as a beacon-fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The face of Jamie. But the vengeful stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bit air. The darkness lifted like a smoke⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And it was early morning.</span>
							<span>Gazing far,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where the West yet kept a pallid star</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To thinner sky where dawn was wearing through,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh shrank with dread, reluctant to renew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The war with that serene antagonist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More fearsome than a smashing iron fist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed that vast negativity of might;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the frustrate vision of the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came moonwise on the gloom of his despair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo, the foe was naught but yielding air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A vacancy to fill with his intent!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So from his spacious bed he ’rose and went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three-footed; and the vision goaded him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All morning southward to the bare sky rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rugged coulee zigzagged, mounting slow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever as it ’rose, the lean creek’s flow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dwindled and dwindled steadily, until</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At last a scooped-out basin would not fill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thenceforth ’twas a way of mocking dust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, in that Hugh still kept the driving lust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For vengeance, this new circumstance of fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Served but to brew more venom for his hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nerved him to avail the most with least.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere noon the crawler chanced upon a feast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of breadroot sunning in a favored draw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sentry gopher from his stronghold saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some three-legged beast, bear-like, yet not a bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With quite misguided fury digging where</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No hapless brother gopher might be found.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while, with stripèd nose above his mound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sentinel chirped shrilly to his clan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scare-tales of that anomaly, the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Devoured the chance-flung manna of the plains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That some vague reminiscence of old rains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kept succulent, despite the burning drouth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So with new vigor Hugh assailed the South,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His pockets laden with the precious roots</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against that coming traverse, where no fruits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of herb or vine or shrub might brave the land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spread rooflike ’twixt the Moreau and the Grand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The coulee deepened; yellow walls flung high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sheer to the ragged strip of blinding sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dazzled and sweltered in the glare of day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Capricious draughts that woke and died away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the heavy drowse, were breatht as flame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And midway down the afternoon, Hugh came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a little patch of spongy ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His thirst became a rage. He gazed around,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seeking a spring; but all about was dry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As strewn bones bleaching to a desert sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did a clawed hole, bought with needed strength,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Return a grateful ooze. And when at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh sucked the mud, he spat it in disgust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It had the acrid tang of broken trust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sweetish, tepid taste of feigning love!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Still hopeful of a spring somewhere above,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He crawled the faster for his taunted thirst.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More damp spots, no less grudging than the first,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Occurred with growing frequence on the way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until amid the purple wane of day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crawler came upon a little pool!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clear as a friend’s heart, ’twas, and seeming cool⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crystal bowl whence skyey deeps looked up.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So might a god set down his drinking cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Charged with a distillation of haut skies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As famished horses, thrusting to the eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Parched muzzles, take a long-sought water-hole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh plunged his head into the brimming bowl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though to share the joy with every sense.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo, the tang of that wide insolence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sky and plain was acrid in the draught!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How ripplingly the lying water laughed!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How like fine sentiment the mirrored sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Won credence for a sink of alkali!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So with false friends. And yet, as may accrue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From specious love some profit of the true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One gift of kindness had the tainted sink.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stripped of his clothes, Hugh let his body drink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At every thirsting pore. Through trunk and limb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The elemental blessing solaced him;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did he rise till, vague with stellar light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lone gulch, buttressing an arch of night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a temple to the Holy Ghost.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As priests in slow procession with the Host,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gusty breeze intoned⁠—now low, now loud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now, as to the murmur of a crowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yielding the dim-torched wonder of the nave.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloft along the dusky architrave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wander-tale of drifting stars evolved;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Hugh lay gazing till the whole resolved</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Into a haze.</span>
							<span>It seemed that Little Jim</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had come to share a merry fire with him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there had been no trouble ’twixt the two.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Jamie listened eagerly while Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Essayed a tangled tale of bears and men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Breadroot and stars. But ever now and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shifting smoke-cloud dimmed the golden hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The leal blue eyes; until with sudden flare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flame effaced them utterly⁠—and lo,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>The gulch bank-full with morning!</span>
							<span>Loath to go,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh lay beside the pool and pondered fate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw his age-long pilgrimage of hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stretch out⁠—a fool’s trail; and it made him cringe;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For still amid the nightly vision’s fringe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His dull wit strayed, companioned with regret.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the sun, a tilted cauldron set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the gulch rim, poured a blaze of day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rose and bathed again, and went his way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sustaining wrath returning with the toil.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At noon the gulch walls, hewn in lighter soil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell back; and coulees dense with shrub and vine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Climbed zigzag to the sharp horizon line,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence one might choose the pilotage of crows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He labored upward through the noonday doze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of breathless shade, where plums were turning red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In tangled bowers, and grapevines overhead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Purpled with fruit to taunt the crawler’s thirst.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With little effort Hugh attained the first;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The latter bargained sharply ere they sold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their luscious clusters for the hoarded gold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of strength that had so very much to buy.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now, having feasted, it was sweet to lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath a sun-proof canopy; and sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Came swiftly.</span>
							<span>Hugh awakened to some deep</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Star-snuffing well of night. Awhile he lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wondered what had happened to the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where he was and what were best to do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when, fog-like, the drowse dispersed, he knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How from the rim above the plain stretched far</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the evening and the morning are,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that ’twere better he should crawl by night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sleep out the glare. With groping hands for sight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Skyward along the broken steep he crawled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw at length, immense and purple-walled⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or sensed⁠—the dusky mystery of plain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gazing aloft, he found the capsized Wain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In mid-plunge down the polar steep. Thereto</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He set his back; and far ahead there grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As some pale blossom from a darkling root,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The star-blanched summit of a lonely butte,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thitherward he dragged his heavy limb.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It seemed naught moved. Time hovered over him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An instant of incipient endeavor.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas ever thus, and should be thus forever⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This groping for the same armful of space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An insubstantial essence of one place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Extentless on a weird frontier of sleep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sheer deep upon unfathomable deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flood of dusk bore down without a sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ocean on the spirits of the drowned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awakened headlong leagues beneath the light.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So lapsed the drowsy aeon of the night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A strangely tensile moment in a trance.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then, as quickened to somnambulance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The heavens, imperceptibly in motion,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were altered as the upward deeps of ocean</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Diluted with a seepage of the moon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The butte-top, late a gossamer balloon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In mid-air tethered hovering, grew down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rooted in a blear expanse of brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, lifting slowly with the ebb of night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took on the harsh solidity of light⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And day was on the prairie like a flame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Scarce had he munched the hoarded roots, when came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A vertigo of slumber. Snatchy dreams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sick pools, inaccessible cool streams,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lured on through giddy vacancies of heat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In swooping flights; now hills of roasting meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made savory the oven of the world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet kept remote peripheries and whirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a burning center that was Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then all were gone, save one, and it turned blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was a heap of cool and luscious fruit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until at length he knew it for the butte</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now mantled with a weaving of the gloam.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="i1">It was the hour when cattle straggle home.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the clearing in a hush of sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saunter, lowing; loiter belly-deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the lush grass by the meadow stream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How like the sound of water in a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The intermittent tinkle of yon bell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A windlass creaks contentment from a well,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cool deeps gurgle as the bucket sinks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now blowing at the trough the plow-team drinks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shaken harness rattles. Sleepy quails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Call far. The warm milk hisses in the pails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There in the dusky barn-lot. Crickets cry.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The meadow twinkles with the glowing fly.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One hears the horses munching at their oats.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The green grows black. A veil of slumber floats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the haunts of home-enamored men.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some freak of memory brought back again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The boyhood world of sight and scent and sound:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It perished, and the prairie ringed him round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blank as the face of fate. In listless mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh set his face against the solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And met the night. The new moon, low and far,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A frail cup tilted, nor the high-swung star,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, might glint on any stream or spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or touch with silver any toothsome thing.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kiote voiced the universal lack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from a nether fire, the plain gave back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The swelter of the noon-glare to the gloom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In the hot hush Hugh heard his temples boom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thirst tortured. Motion was a languid pain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why seek some further nowhere on the plain?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here might the kiotes feast as well as there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So spoke some loose-lipped spirit of despair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still Hugh moved, volitionless⁠—a weight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Submissive to that now unconscious hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As darkling water to the hidden moon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i1">Now when the night wore on in middle swoon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crawler, roused from stupor, was aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some strange alteration in the air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To breathe became an act of conscious will.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The starry waste was ominously still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The far-off kiote’s yelp came sharp and clear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As through a tunnel in the atmosphere⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ponderable, resonating mass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The limp leg dragging on the sun-dried grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Produced a sound unnaturally loud.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Crouched, panting, Hugh looked up but saw no cloud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An oily film seemed spread upon the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now dully staring as the open eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one in fever. Gasping, choked with thirst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A childish rage assailed Hugh, and he cursed:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas like a broken spirit’s outcry, tossed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon hell’s burlesque sabbath for the lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And briefly space seemed crowded with the voice.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To wait and die, to move and die⁠—what choice?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh chose not, yet he crawled; though more and more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He felt the futile strife was nearly o’er.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as he went, a muffled rumbling grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More felt than heard; for long it puzzled Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Somehow ’twas coextensive with his thirst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet boundless; swollen blood-veins ere they burst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might give such warning, so he thought. And still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drone seemed heaping up a phonic hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That towered in a listening profound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly a mountain peak of sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came toppling to a heaven-jolting fall!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie shuddered, and a raucous drawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran far and perished in the outer deep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As one too roughly shaken out of sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh stared bewildered. Still the face of night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remained the same, save where upon his right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The moon had vanished ’neath the prairie rim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly the meaning came to him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He turned and saw athwart the northwest sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some black eyelid shutting on an eye,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A coming night to which the night was day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Star-hungry, ranged in regular array,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lifting mass assailed the Dragon’s lair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Submerged the region of the hounded Bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out-topped the tall Ox-Driver and the Pole.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the while there came a low-toned roll,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less sound in air than tremor in the earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where, like flame upon a windy hearth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep in the further murk sheet-lightning flared.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the southern arc of heaven stared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A half-shut eye, near blind with fever rheum;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the plain lay tranquil as a tomb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein the dead reck not a menaced world.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What turmoil now? Lo, ragged columns hurled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pell-mell up stellar slopes! Swift blue fires leap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the wild assailants of the steep!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the solid rear a dull boom runs!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So light horse squadrons charge beneath the guns.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now once again the night is deathly still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What ghastly peace upon the zenith hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No longer starry? Not a sound is heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So poised the hush, it seems a whispered word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might loose all noises in an avalanche.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Only the black mass moves, and far glooms blanch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fitful flashes. The capricious flare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reveals the butte-top tall and lonely there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some gray prophet contemplating doom.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But hark! What spirits whisper in the gloom?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What sibilation of conspiracies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ruffles the hush⁠—or murmuring of trees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ghosts of the ancient forest⁠—or old rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In some hallucination of the plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A frustrate phantom mourning? All around,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That e’er evolving, ne’er resolving sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gropes in the stifling hollow of the night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then⁠—once⁠—twice⁠—thrice⁠—a blade of blinding light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ripped up the heavens, and the deluge came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A burst of wind and water, noise and flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That hurled the watcher flat upon the ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moment past Hugh famished; now, half drowned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gasped for breath amid the hurtling drench.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So might a testy god, long sought to quench</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A puny thirst, pour wassail, hurling after</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crashing bowl with wild sardonic laughter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see man wrestle with his answered prayer!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Prone to the roaring flaw and ceaseless flare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man drank deeply with the drinking grass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until it seemed the storm would never pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ravin down the painted murk for aye.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When had what dreamer seen a glaring day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leagues of prairie pantingly aquiver?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flame, flood, wind, noise and darkness were a river</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tearing a cosmic channel to no sea.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The tortured night wore on; then suddenly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Peace fell. Remotely the retreating Wrath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trailed dull, reluctant thunders in its path,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up along a broken stair of cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Dawn came creeping whitely. Like a shroud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray vapors clung along the sodden plain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up rose the sun to wipe the final stain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fury from the sky and drink the mist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against a flawless arch of amethyst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The butte soared, like a soul serene and white</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because of the katharsis of the night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All day Hugh fought with sleep and struggled on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Southeastward; for the heavy heat was gone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite the naked sun. The blank Northwest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Breathed coolly; and the crawler thought it best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To move while yet each little break and hollow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shallow basin of the bison-wallow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Begrudged the earth and air its dwindling store.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now that thirst was conquered, more and more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He felt the gnaw of hunger like a rage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once, from dozing in a clump of sage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lone jackrabbit bounded. As a flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hope flared in Hugh, until the memory came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of him who robbed a sleeping friend and fled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then hate and hunger merged; the man saw red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And momently the hare and Little Jim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were one blurred mark for murder unto him⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Elusive, taunting, sweet to clutch and tear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rabbit paused to scan the crippled bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ground its teeth as though it chewed a root.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when, in witless rage, Hugh drew his boot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hurled it with a curse, the hare loped off,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its critic ears turned back, as though to scoff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At silly brutes that threw their legs away.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Night like a shadow on enduring day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swooped by. The dream of crawling and the act</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were phases of one everlasting fact:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh woke, and he was doing what he dreamed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The butte, outstripped at eventide, now seemed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intent to follow. Ever now and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crawler paused to calculate again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What dear-bought yawn of distance dwarfed the hill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Close in the rear it soared, a Titan still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose hand-in-pocket saunter kept the pace.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Distinct along the southern rim of space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A low ridge lay, the crest of the divide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What rest and plenty on the other side!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through what lush valleys ran what crystal brooks!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there in virgin meadows wayside nooks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With leaf and purple cluster dulled the light!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All day it seemed that distant Pisgah Height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retreated, and the tall butte dogged the rear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At eve a stripèd gopher chirping near</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave Hugh an inspiration. Now, at least,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No thieving friend should rob him of a feast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His great idea stirred him as a shout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off came a boot, a sock was ravelled out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The coarse yarn, fashioned to a running snare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He placed about the gopher’s hole with care,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then withdrew to hold the yarn and wait.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The night-bound moments, ponderous with fate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crept slowly by. The battered gray face leered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In expectation. Down the grizzled beard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran slaver from anticipating jaws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Evolving twilight hovered to a pause.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The light wind fell. Again and yet again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man devoured his fancied prey: and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within the noose a timid snout was thrust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His hand unsteadied with the hunger lust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh jerked the yarn. It broke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">Down swooped the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shadow of despair. Bleak height on height,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, a sheer abyss enclosed him round.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clutching a strand of yarn, he heard the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some infernal turmoil under him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grimly he strove to reach the ragged rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That snared a star, until the skyey space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was darkened with a roof of Jamie’s face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the yarn was broken, and he fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-tumble like a stricken bat, his yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Woke hordes of laughers down the giddy yawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that black pit⁠—and suddenly ’twas dawn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Dream-dawn, dream-noon, dream-twilight! Yet, possest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By one stern dream more clamorous than the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh headed for a gap that notched the hills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherethrough a luring murmur of cool rills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A haunting smell of verdure seemed to creep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By fits the wild adventure of his sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Became the cause of all his waking care,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he complained unto the empty air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Jamie broke the yarn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">The sun and breeze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had drunk all shallow basins to the lees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now and then some gully, choked with mud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retained a turbid relict of the flood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dream-dawn, dream-noon, dream-night! And still obsessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By that one dream more clamorous than the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh struggled for the crest of the divide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when at length he saw the other side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas but a rumpled waste of yellow hills!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deep-sunk, wiser self had known the rills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nooks to be the facture of a whim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet had the pleasant lie befriended him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the brutal fact had come to stare.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Succumbing to a languorous despair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He mourned his fate with childish uncontrol</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nursed that deadly adder of the soul,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Self-pity. Let the crows swoop down and feed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, batten on a thing that died of need,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A poor old wretch betrayed of God and Man!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So peevishly his broken musing ran,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, glutted with the luxury of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He turned to see the butte, that he might know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How little all his striving could avail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against ill-luck. And lo, a finger-nail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At arm-length held, could blot it out of space!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A goading purpose and a creeping pace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had dwarfed the Titan in a haze of blue!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly new power came to Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gazing on his masterpiece of will.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So fare the wise on Pisgah.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Down the hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the higher vision consecrate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now sallied forth the new triumvirate⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Weariness, a Hunger and a Glory⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against tyrannic Chance. As in a story</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some higher Hugh observed the baser part.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So sits the artist throned above his art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor recks the travail so the end be fair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the wrinkled hills pressed in to stare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The arch of heaven was an eye a-gaze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as Hugh went, he fashioned many a phrase</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For use when, by some friendly ember-light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His tale of things endured should speed the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all this gloom grow golden in the sharing.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So wrought the old evangel of high daring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The duty and the beauty of endeavor,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The privilege of going on forever,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>A victor in the moment.</span>
							<span>Ah, but when</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The night slipped by and morning came again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sky and hill were only sky and hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And crawling but an agony of will.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So once again the old triumvirate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A buzzard Hunger and a viper Hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Together with the baser part of Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Went visionless.</span>
							<span>That day the wild geese flew,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vague in a gray profundity of sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on into the night their muffled cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Haunted the moonlight like a far farewell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It made Hugh homesick, though he could not tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what he yearned; and in his fitful sleeping</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cry became the sound of Jamie weeping,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Immeasurably distant.</span>
							<span>Morning broke,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blear, chilly, through a fog that drove as smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the booming Northwest. Sweet and sad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came creeping back old visions of the lad⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some trick of speech, some merry little lilt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brooding blue of eyes too clear for guilt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wind-blown golden hair. Hate slept that day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And half of Hugh was half a life away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wandering spirit wistful of the past;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And half went drifting with the autumn blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That mourned among the melancholy hills;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For something of the lethargy that kills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came creeping close upon the ebb of hate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Only the raw wind, like the lash of Fate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could have availed to move him any more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At last the buzzard beak no longer tore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His vitals, and he ceased to think of food.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fighter slumbered, and a maudlin mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foretold the dissolution of the man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sobbed, and down his beard the big tears ran.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the scene is changed; the bleak wind’s cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becomes a flight of bullets snarling by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where on yonder summit skulk the Rees.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the sky, in silhouette, he sees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The headstrong Jamie in the leaden rain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now serenely beautiful and slain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dear lad lies within a gusty tent.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus vexed with doleful whims the crawler went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Adrift before the wind, nor saw the trail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till close on night he knew a rugged vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had closed about him; and a hush was there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though still a moaning in the upper air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Told how the gray-winged gale blew out the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath a clump of brush he swooned away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into an icy void; and waking numb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the still white dawn of death had come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On this, some cradle-valley of the soul.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw a dim, enchanted hollow roll</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath him, and the brush thereof was fleece;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like the body of the perfect peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thralled the whole, abode the break of day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed no wind had ever come that way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor sound dwelt there, nor echo found the place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Hugh lay lapped in wonderment a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vexed with a snarl whereof the ends were lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, shivering, he wondered if a frost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fallen with the dying of the blast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, vaguely troubled, listlessly he cast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gaze about him: lo, above his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gray-green curtain of his chilly bed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was broidered thick with plums! Or so it seemed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he was half persuaded that he dreamed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a steady stare he strove to keep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That treasure for the other side of sleep.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Returning hunger bade him rise; in vain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He struggled with a fine-spun mesh of pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That trammelled him, until a yellow stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of day flowed down the white vale of a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left it disenchanted in the glare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, warmed and soothed, Hugh rose and feasted there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thought once more of reaching the Moreau.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To southward with a painful pace and slow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He went stiff-jointed; and a gnawing ache</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In that hip-wound he had for Jamie’s sake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Oft made him groan⁠—nor wrought a tender mood:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rankling weapon of ingratitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was turned again with every puckering twinge.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Far down the vale a narrow winding fringe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wilted green betokened how a spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There sent a little rill meandering;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Hugh was greatly heartened, for he knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What fruits and herbs might flourish in the slough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thirst, henceforth, should torture not again.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So day on day, despite the crawler’s pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All in the windless, golden autumn weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These two, as comrades, struggled south together⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The homeless graybeard and the homing rill:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one was sullen with the lust to kill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one went crooning of the moon-wooed vast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For each the many-fathomed peace at last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But oh the boon of singing on the way!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So came these in the golden fall of day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto a sudden turn in the ravine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefrom Hugh saw a flat of cluttered green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the further bluffs of the Moreau.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With sinking heart he paused and gazed below</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the goal of so much toil and pain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yon green had seemed a paradise to gain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The while he thirsted where the lonely butte</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked far and saw no toothsome herb or fruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all that yellow barren dim with heat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now the wasting body cried for meat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sickness was upon him. Game should pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor deign to fear the mighty hunter Glass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But curiously sniffing, pause to stare.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now while thus musing, Hugh became aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some low murmur, phasic and profound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce risen o’er the border line of sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It might have been the coursing of his blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or thunder heard remotely, or a flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung down a wooded valley far away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet that had been no weather-breeding day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twould frost that night; amid the thirsty land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All streams ran thin; and when he pressed a hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On either ear, the world seemed very still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The deep-worn channel of the little rill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here fell away to eastward, rising, rough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With old rain-furrows, to a lofty bluff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That faced the river with a yellow wall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thereto, perplexed, Hugh set about to crawl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor reached the summit till the sun was low.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far-spread, shade-dimpled in the level glow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The still land told not whence the murmur grew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But where the green strip melted into blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far down the winding valley of the stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh saw what seemed the tempest of a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At mimic havoc in the timber-glooms.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from the sweeping of gigantic brooms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dust cloud deepened down the dwindling river;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the distant tree-tops ran a shiver</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And huddled thickets writhed as in a gale.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>On creeps the windless tempest up the vale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The while the murmur deepens to a roar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with the wider yawning of a door.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the agitated green gloom gapes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To belch a flood of countless dusky shapes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That mill and wrangle in a turbid flow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Migrating myriads of the buffalo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bound for the winter pastures of the Platte!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Exhausted, faint with need of meat, Hugh sat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And watched the mounting of the living flood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down came the night, and like a blot of blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lopped moon weltered in the dust-bleared East.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sleep came and gave a Barmecidal feast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a merry flame were simmering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sweet haunches of the calving of the Spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tender tongues that never tasted snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And marrow bones that yielded to a blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such treasure! Hugh awoke with gnashing teeth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heard the mooing drone of cows beneath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The roll of hoofs, the challenge of the bull.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So sounds a freshet when the banks are full</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bursting brush-jams bellow to the croon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of water through green leaves. The ragged moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now drenched the valley in an eerie rain:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Below, the semblance of a hurricane;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above, the perfect calm of brooding frost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which the wolves in doleful tenson tossed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From hill to hill the ancient hunger-song.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In broken sleep Hugh rolled the chill night long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half conscious of the flowing flesh below.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now he trailed a bison in the snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That deepened till he could not lift his feet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again, he battled for a chunk of meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With some gray beast that fought with icy fang.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he woke, the wolves no longer sang;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White dawn athwart a white world smote the hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thunder rolled along the valley still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Morn, wiping up the frost as with a sponge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Day on the steep and down the nightward plunge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Twilight saw the myriads moving on.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dust to the westward where the van had gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dust and muffled thunder in the east!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh starved while gazing on a Titan feast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tons of beef, that eddied there and swirled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had stilled the crying hungers of the world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet not one little morsel was for him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The red sun, pausing on the dusty rim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Induced a panic aspect of his plight:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The herd would pass and vanish in the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And be another dream to cling and flout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now scanning all the summit round about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the rubble of the ancient drift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw a boulder. ’Twas too big to lift,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet he might roll it. Painfully and slow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He worked it to the edge, then let it go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And breathlessly expectant watched it fall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It hurtled down the leaning yellow wall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bounding from a brushy ledge’s brow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It barely grazed the buttocks of a cow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made a moment’s eddy where it struck.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In peevish wrath Hugh cursed his evil luck,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seizing rubble, gave his fury vent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By pelting bison till his strength was spent:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So might a child assail the crowding sea!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, sick at heart and musing bitterly,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shambled down the steep way to the creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And having stayed the tearing buzzard beak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With breadroot and the waters of the rill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slept till the white of morning o’er the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a whisper groping in a hush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stream’s low trill seemed loud. The tumbled brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rumpled tree-tops in the flat below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a fog that clung like spectral snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay motionless; nor any sound was there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No frost had fallen, but the crystal air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smacked of the autumn, and a heavy dew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay hoar upon the grass. There came on Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A picture, vivid in the moment’s thrill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of martialed corn-shocks marching up a hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spiked fields dotted with the pumpkin’s gold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It vanished; and, a-shiver with the cold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He brooded on the mockeries of Chance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shrewd malignity of Circumstance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That either gave too little or too much.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yet, with the fragment of a hope for crutch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His spirit rallied, and he rose to go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though each stiff joint resisted as a foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that old hip-wound battled with his will.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So down along the channel of the rill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the vale below he fought his way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The frore fog, rifting in the risen day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Revealed the havoc of the living flood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The river shallows beaten into mud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slender saplings shattered in the crush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All lower leafage stripped, the tousled brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despoiled of fruitage, winter-thin, aghast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where the avalanche of hoofs had passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed nor herb nor grass had ever been.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this the hard-won paradise, wherein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A food-devouring plethora of food</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had come to make a starving solitude!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yet hope and courage mounted with the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surely, Hugh thought, some ill-begotten one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all that striving mass had lost the strife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And perished in the headlong stream of life⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A feast to fill the bellies of the strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That still the weak might perish. All day long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He struggled down the stricken vale, nor saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What thing he sought. But when the twilight awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was creeping in, beyond a bend arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A din as though the kiotes and the crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fought there with shrill and raucous battle cries.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Small need had Hugh to ponder and surmise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What guerdon beak and fang contended for.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within himself the oldest cause of war</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought forth upon the instant fang and beak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He too would fight! Nor had he far to seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the driftwood strewn about the sand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For weapons suited to a brawny hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With such a purpose. Armed with club and stone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He forged ahead into the battle zone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from a screening thicket spied his foes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He saw a bison carcass black with crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over it a welter of black wings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And round about, a press of tawny rings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, like a muddy current churned to foam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a snag, flashed whitely in the gloam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With naked teeth; while close about the prize</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Red beaks and muzzles bloody to the eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betrayed how worth a struggle was the feast.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then came on Hugh the fury of the beast⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eat or to be eaten! Better so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To die contending with a living foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than fight the yielding distance and the lack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Masked by the brush he opened the attack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever where a stone or club fell true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the stricken one an uproar grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brute tore brute, forgetful of the prey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the whole pack tumbled in the fray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bleeding flanks and lacerated throats.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, as the leader of a host who notes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cannon-wrought confusion of the foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh seized the moment for a daring blow.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The wolf’s a coward, who, in goodly packs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May counterfeit the courage that he lacks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a craven’s fury crush the bold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the disunited mass that rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In suicidal strife, became aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How some great beast that shambled like a bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bore down with roaring challenge, fell a hush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the pack, some slinking to the brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With tails a-droop; while some that whined in pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Writhed off on reddened trails. With bristled mane</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the flying stones a bolder few</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snarled menace at the foe as they withdrew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fill the outer dusk with clamorings.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloft upon a moaning wind of wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crows with harsh, vituperative cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now saw a gray wolf of prodigious size</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Devouring with the frenzy of the starved.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus fell to Hugh a bison killed and carved;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so Fate’s whims mysteriously trend⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Woe in the silken meshes of the friend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weal in the might and menace of the foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But with the fading of the afterglow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The routed wolves found courage to return:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the brush Hugh saw their eyeballs burn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And well he knew how futile stick and stone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should prove by night to keep them from their own.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Better is less with safety, than enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ruin. He retreated to a bluff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarce had reached it when the pack swooped in</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Upon the carcass.</span>
							<span>All night long, the din</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wrangling wolves assailed the starry air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While high above them in a brushy lair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh dreamed of gnawing at the bloody feast.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Along about the blanching of the east,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When sleep is weirdest and a moment’s flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembered coextensive with the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May teem with hapful years; as light in smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the jumble of Hugh’s dreaming broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A buzz of human voices. Once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rode the westward trail with Henry’s men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hoof-smitten leagues consuming in a dust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the nightmare of that broken trust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was on him, and he lay beside the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A corpse, yet heard the muffled parleying</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above him of the looters of the dead:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when he might have riddled what they said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The babble flattened to a blur of gray⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo, upon a bleak frontier of day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spent moon staring down! A little space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh scrutinized the featureless white face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though ’twould speak. But when again the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew up, and seemed to come from under ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He cast the drowse, and peering down the slope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld what set at grapple fear and hope⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three Indian horsemen riding at a jog!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their ponies, wading belly-deep in fog,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That clung along the valley, seemed to swim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through a thinner vapor moving dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>The men were ghost-like.</span>
							<span>Could they be the Sioux?</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Almost the wish became belief in Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or were they Rees? As readily the doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withheld him from the hazard of a shout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while he followed them with baffled gaze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown large and vague, dissolving in the haze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>They vanished westward.</span>
							<span>Knowing well the wont</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Indians moving on the bison-hunt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forthwith Hugh guessed the early riders were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The outflung feelers of a tribe astir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some huge cat gone mousing. So he lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Concealed, impatient with the sleepy day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dawdled in the dawning. Would it bring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Good luck or ill? His eager questioning,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As crawling fog, took on a golden hue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From sunrise. He was waiting for the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their parfleche panniers fat with sun-dried maize</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wasna! From the mint of evil days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would coin tales and be no begging guest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the tribal feast-fires burning west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But kinsman of the blood of daring men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the crawler stood erect again⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O Friend-Betrayer at the Big Horn’s mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beware of someone riding from the South</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do the deed that he had lived to do!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the sun stood hour-high in the blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where a cloud of startled blackbirds rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down stream, a panic tumult broke the doze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of windless morning. What unwelcome news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Embroiled the parliament of feathered shrews?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A boiling cloud against the sun they lower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flackering strepent; now a sooty shower,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big-flaked, squall-driven westward, down they flutter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set a clump of cottonwoods a-sputter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With cold black fire! And once again, some shock</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sight or sound flings panic in the flock⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray boughs exploding in a ruck of birds!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What augury in orniscopic words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did yon swart sibyls on the morning scrawl?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now broke abruptly through the clacking brawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A camp-dog’s barking and a pony’s neigh;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat a running nicker fled away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attenuating to a rearward hush;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo! in hailing distance ’round the brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fringed a jutting bluff’s base like a beard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a stubborn chin out-thrust, appeared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A band of mounted warriors! In their van</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloof and lonely rode a gnarled old man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a piebald stallion. Stooped was he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath his heavy years, yet haughtily</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He wore them like the purple of a king.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Keen for a goal, as from the driving string</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A barbed and feathered arrow truly sped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His face was like a flinty arrow-head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brooded westward in a steady stare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was a sift of winter in his hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bleakness of brown winter in his look.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh saw, and huddled closer in his nook.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled the bright dreams of safety, feast and rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that keen, cold brooder on the West,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As gaudy leaves before the blizzard flee.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas Elk Tongue, fighting chieftain of the Ree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all his people at his pony’s tail⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full two-score lodges emptied on the trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Of hunger!</span>
							<span>On they came in ravelled rank,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a haggard eye and hollow flank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made plain how close and pitilessly pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The enemy that drove them to the West⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such foeman as no warrior ever slew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tale of cornfields plundered by the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their sagging panniers told. Yet rich enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They seemed to him who watched them from the bluff;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yea, pampered nigh the limit of desire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No friend had filched from them the boon of fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hurled them shivering back upon the beast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Erect they went, full-armed to strive, at least;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nightly in a cozy ember-glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hope fed them with a dream of buffalo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon to be overtaken. After that,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Home with their Pawnee cousins on the Platte,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much meat and merry-making till the Spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On dragged the rabble like a fraying string</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too tautly drawn. The rich-in-ponies rode,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For much is light and little is a load</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among all heathen with no Christ to save!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray seekers for the yet begrudging grave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bent with the hoeing of forgotten maize,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wood-hewers, water-bearers all their days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Toiled ’neath the life-long hoarding of their packs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nursing squaws, their babies at their backs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whining because the milk they got was thinned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In dugs of famine, strove as with a wind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invincibly equipped with their first bows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The striplings strutted, knowing, as youth knows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How fair life is beyond the beckoning blue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cold-eyed the grandsires plodded, for they knew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As frosted heads may know, how all trails merge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In what lone land. Raw maidens on the verge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some half-guessed-at mystery of life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In wistful emulation of the wife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stooped to the fancied burden of the race;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor read upon the withered granddam’s face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scrawled tale of that burden and its woe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slant to the sagging poles of the travaux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Numb to the squaw’s harsh railing and the goad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lean cayuses toiled. And children rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Atop the household plunder, wonder-eyed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see a world flow by on either side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From blue air sprung to vanish in blue air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>A river of enchantments.</span>
							<span>Here and there</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The camp-curs loped upon a vexing quest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where countless hoofs had left a palimpsest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A taunting snarl of broken scents. And now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They sniff the clean bones of the bison cow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Howl to the skies; and now with manes a-rough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They nose the man-smell leading to the bluff;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pause puzzled at the base and sweep the height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With questioning yelps. Aloft, crouched low in fright,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already Hugh can hear the braves’ guffaws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At their scorned foeman yielded to the squaws’</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inverted mercy and a slow-won grave.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Earth’s first mother scolded from a cave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that dear riddle of her love began,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No man has wrought a weapon against man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To match the deadly venom brewed above</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lean, blue, blinding heart-fires of her love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well might the hunted hunter shrink aghast!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But thrice three seasons yet should swell the past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So was it writ, ere Fate’s keen harriers</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Should run Hugh Glass to earth.</span>
							<span>The hungry curs</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took up again the tangled scent of food.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still flowed the rabble through the solitude⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thinning stream now of the halt, the weak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all who had not very far to seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For that weird pass whereto the fleet are slow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out of it keen winds and numbing blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrill with the fleeing voices of the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slowly the scattered stragglers, making head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against their weariness as up a steep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled westward; and the morning lay asleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the valley fallen wondrous still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Hugh kept his nook, nor ventured forth, until</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The high day toppled to the blue descent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When thirst became a master, and he went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With painful scrambling down the broken scarp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lured by the stream, that like a smitten harp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rippled a muted music to the sun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Scarce had he crossed the open flat, and won</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The halfway fringe of willows, when he saw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow plodding up the trail, a tottering squaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose years made big the little pack she bore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crouched in the brush Hugh watched her. More and more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little burden tempted him. Why not?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thin cry throttled in that lonely spot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could bring no succor. None should ever know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save him, the feasted kiote and the crow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why one poor crone found not the midnight fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor would the vanguard, quick with young desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Devouring distance westward like a flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Regret this ash dropped rearward.</span>
							<span>On she came,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow-footed, staring blankly on the sand⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So close now that it needed but a hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out-thrust to overthrow her; aye, to win</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That priceless spoil, a little tent of skin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flint and steel, a kettle and a knife!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What did the dying with the means of life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thus the fit-to-live should suffer lack?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Poised for the lunge, what whimsy held him back?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why did he gaze upon the passing prize,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor seize it? Did some gust of ghostly cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaken round her⁠—whisperings of Eld,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wraith-voices of the babies she had held⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To plead for pity on her graveward days?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far down a moment’s cleavage in the haze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of backward years Hugh saw her now⁠—nor saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little burden and the feeble squaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But someone sitting haloed like a saint</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside a hearth long cold. The dream grew faint;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he looked again, the crone was gone</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Beyond a clump of willow.</span>
							<span>Crawling on,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He reached the river. Leaning to a pool</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Calm in its cup of sand, he saw⁠—a fool!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wild, wry mask of mirth, a-grin, yet grim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose there to claim identity with him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ridicule his folly. Pity? Faugh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who pitied this, that it should spare a squaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spent in the spawning of a scorpion brood?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He drank and hastened down the solitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fleeing that thing which fleered him, and was Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as he went his self-accusing grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with it, anger; till it came to seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That somehow some sly Jamie of a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had plundered him again; and he was strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lust of vengeance and the sting of wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So that he travelled faster than for days.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the eve in many-shaded grays</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wove the day’s shroud, and through the lower lands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lean fog-arms groped with chilling spirit hands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh paused perplexed. Elusive, haunting, dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though some memory that stirred in him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invasive of the real, outgrew the dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came upon the breeze that stole up stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>A whiff of woodsmoke.</span>
							<span>’Twixt a beat and beat</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Hugh’s deluded heart, it seemed the sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Allure of home.⁠—A brief way, and one came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the clearing where the sumach flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran round the forest-fringe; and just beyond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One saw the slough grass nodding in the pond</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unto the sleepy troll the bullfrogs sung.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then one saw the place where one was young⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The log-house sitting on a stumpy rise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hearth-lit within, its windows were as eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That love much and are faded with old tears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed regretful of a life’s arrears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet patient, with a self-denying poise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some old mother for her bearded boys</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waiting sweet-hearted and a little sad.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So briefly dreamed a recrudescent lad</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Beneath gray hairs, and fled.</span>
							<span>Through chill and damp</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still groped the odor, hinting at a camp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A two-tongued herald wooing hope and fear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was hospitality or danger near?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Sioux war-party hot upon the trail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or laggard Rees? Hugh crawled across the vale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Toiled up along a zigzag gully’s bed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reached a bluff’s top. In a smudge of red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The West burned low. Hill summits, yet alight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pools of gloom anticipating night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mottled the landscape to the dull blue rim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What freak of fancy had imposed on him?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could one smell home-smoke fifty years away?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw no fire; no pluming spire of gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose in the dimming air to woo or warn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He lay upon the bare height, fagged, forlorn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And old times came upon him with the creep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of subtle drugs that put the will to sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wreak doom to the soothing of a dream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So listlessly he scanned the sombrous stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce seeing what he scanned. The dark increased;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A chill wind wakened from the frowning east</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And soughed along the vale.</span>
							<span>Then with a start</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw what broke the torpor of his heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And set the wild blood free. From where he lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An easy point-blank rifle-shot away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Appeared a mystic germinating spark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in some secret garden of the dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upreared a frail, blue, nodding stem, whereon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ruddy lily flourished⁠—and was gone!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What miracle was this? Again it grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scarlet blossom on the stem of blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And withered back again into the night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With pounding heart Hugh crawled along the height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reached a point of vantage whence, below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw capricious witch-lights dim and glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like far-spent embers quickened in a breeze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas surely not a camp of laggard Rees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor yet of Siouan warriors hot in chase.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dusk and a quiet bivouacked in that place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A doddering vagrant with numb hands, the Wind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fumbled the dying ashes there, and whined.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was the day-old camp-ground of the foe!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Glad-hearted now, Hugh gained the vale below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Keen to possess once more the ancient gift.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nearing the glow, he saw vague shadows lift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the painted gloom of smouldering logs⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Distorted bulks that bristled, and were dogs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snarling at this invasion of their lair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh charged upon them, growling like a bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And sent them whining.</span>
							<span>Now again to view</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The burgeoning of scarlet, gold and blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The immemorial miracle of fire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From heaped-up twigs a tenuous smoky spire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose, and made an altar of the place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spark-glow, faint upon the grizzled face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transformed the kneeling outcast to a priest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, native of the light-begetting East,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Wind became a chanting acolyte.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These two, entempled in the vaulted night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Breathed conjuries of interwoven breath.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, hark!⁠—the snapping of the chains of Death!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From dead wood, lo!⁠—the epiphanic god!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Once more the freightage of the fennel rod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dissolved the chilling pall of Jovian scorn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wonder of the resurrection morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The face apocalyptic and the sword,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The glory of the many-symboled Lord,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh, lifting up his eyes about him, saw!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And something in him like a vernal thaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Voiced with the sound of many waters, ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And quickened to the laughter of a man.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Light-heartedly he fed the singing flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took its blessing: till a soft sleep came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With dreaming that was like a pleasant tale.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The far white dawn was peering up the vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he awoke to indolent content.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A few shorn stars in pale astonishment</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were huddled westward; and the fire was low.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three scrawny camp-curs, mustered in a row</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the heap of embers, heads askew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ears pricked to question what the man might do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat wistfully regardant. He arose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they, grown canny in a school of blows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Skulked to a safer distance, there to raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dolorous chanting of the evil days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their gray breath like the body of a prayer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh nursed the sullen embers to a flare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then set about to view an empty camp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As once before; but now no smoky lamp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of blear suspicion searched a gloom of fraud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein a smirking Friendship, like a bawd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Embraced a coward Safety; now no grief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt hideous revelation and belief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made womanish the man; but glad to strive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hope to nerve him and a will to drive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He knew that he could finish in the race.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The staring impassivity of space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No longer mocked; the dreadful skyward climb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where distance seemed identical with time,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was past now; and that mystic something, luck,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without which worth may flounder in the ruck,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Had turned to him again.</span>
							<span>So flamelike soared</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rekindled hope in him as he explored</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the ash-heaps; and the lean dogs ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And barked about him, for the love of man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wistful, yet fearing. Surely he could find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some trifle in the hurry left behind⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or haply hidden in the trampled sand⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That to the cunning of a needy hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should prove the master-key of circumstance:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’tis the little gifts of grudging Chance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Well husbanded, make victors.</span>
							<span>Long he sought</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without avail; and, crawling back, he thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of how the dogs were growing less afraid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how one might be skinned without a blade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flake of flint might do it: he would try.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then he saw⁠—or did the servile eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trick out a mental image like the real?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw a glimmering of whetted steel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside a heap now washed with morning light!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Scarce more of marvel and the sense of might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moved Arthur when he reached a hand to take</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fay-wrought brand emerging from the lake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereby a kingdom should be lopped of strife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than Hugh now, pouncing on a trader’s knife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Worn hollow in the use of bounteous days!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now behold a rich man by the blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his own hearth⁠—a lord of steel and fire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not having, but the measure of desire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Determines wealth. Who gaining more, seek most,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are ever the pursuers of a ghost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lend their fleetness to the fugitive.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Hugh, long goaded by the wish to live,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What gage of mastery in fire and tool!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That twain wherewith Time put the brute to school,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Evolving Man, the maker and the seer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twixt urging hunger and restraining fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gaunt dogs hovered round the man; while he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cajoled them in the language of the Ree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And simulated feeding them with sand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the boldest dared to sniff his hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bare-fanged and with conciliative whine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through bristled mane the quick blade bit the spine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Below the skull; and as a flame-struck thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The body humped and shuddered, withering;</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>The lank limbs huddled, wilted.</span>
							<span>Now to skin</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The carcass, dig a hole, arrange therein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fix the pelt with stakes, the flesh-side up.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This done, he shaped the bladder to a cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On willow withes, and filled the rawhide pot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With water from the river⁠—made it hot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With roasted stones, and set the meat a-boil.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those days of famine and prodigious toil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had wrought bulimic cravings in the man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarce the cooking of the flesh outran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The eating of it. As a fed flame towers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>According to the fuel it devours,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His hunger with indulgence grew, nor ceased</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the kettle, empty of the feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went dim, the sky and valley, merging, swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In subtle smoke that smothered out the world.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Hugh slept.</span>
							<span>And then⁠—as divers, mounting, sunder</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A murmuring murk to blink in sudden wonder</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a dazzling upper deep of blue⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rose again to consciousness, and knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The low sun beating slantly on his face.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now indolently gazing round the place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He noted how the curs had revelled there⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bones and entrails gone; some scattered hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alone remaining of the pot of hide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How strange he had not heard them at his side!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And granting but one afternoon had passed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What could have made the fire burn out so fast?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had daylight waned, night fallen, morning crept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Noon blazed, a new day dwindled while he slept?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was the friendlike fire a Jamie too?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the twilit consciousness of Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old obsession like a wounded bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Fluttered.</span>
							<span>He got upon his knees and stirred</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The feathery ash; but not a spark was there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already with the failing sun the air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went keen, betokening a frosty night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh winced with something like the clutch of fright.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How could he bear the torture, how sustain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sting of that antiquity of pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rolled back upon him⁠—face again the foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That yielding victor, fleet in being slow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That huge, impersonal malevolence?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So readily the tentacles of sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Root in the larger standard of desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Hugh fell farther in the loss of fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than in the finding of it he arose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly the place grew strange, as grows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A friend’s house, when the friend is on his bier,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that was familiar there and dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Puts on a blank, inhospitable look.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh set his face against the east, and took</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dreariest of ways, the trail of flight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He would outcrawl the shadow of the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And have the day to blanket him in sleep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But as he went to meet the gloom a-creep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bemused with life’s irrational rebuffs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A yelping of the dogs among the bluffs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose, hunger-whetted, stabbing; rent the pall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of evening silence; blunted to a drawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the arid waterways, and died.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as the echo to the sound replied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So in the troubled mind of Hugh was wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A reminiscent cry of thought to thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, groping, found an unlocked door to life:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dogs⁠—keen flint to skin one⁠—then the knife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discovered. Why, that made a flint and steel!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No further with the subtle foe at heel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He fled; for all about him in the rock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To waken when the needy hand might knock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A savior slept! He found a flake of flint,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scraped from his shirt a little wad of lint,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spilled on it from the smitten stone a shower</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ruddy seed; and saw the mystic flower</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That genders its own summer, bloom anew!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so capricious luck came back to Hugh;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he was happier than he had been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Jamie to that unforgiven sin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had yielded, ages back upon the Grand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now he would turn the cunning of his hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To carving crutches, that he might arise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be manlike, lift more rapidly the skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That crouched between his purpose and the mark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The warm glow housed him from the frosty dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there he wrought in very joyous mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sang by fits⁠—whereat the solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set laggard singers snatching at the tune.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gaunter for their hunt, the dogs came soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To haunt the shaken fringes of the glow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, pitching voices to the timeless woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outwailed the lilting. So the Chorus sings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of terror, pity and the tears of things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When most the doomed protagonist is gay.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stars swarmed over, and the front of day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whitened above a white world, and the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose on a sleeper with a task well done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor roused him till its burning topped the blue.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>When Hugh awoke, there woke a younger Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now half a stranger; and ’twas good to feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ebbing sleep the old green vigor steal,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thrilling, along his muscles and his veins,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in a lull of winter-cleansing rains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gray bough quickens to the sap a-creep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It chanced the dogs lay near him, sound asleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Curled nose to buttock in the noonday glow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He killed the larger with a well-aimed blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Skinned, dressed and set it roasting on a spit;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when ’twas cooked, ate sparingly of it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For need might yet make little seem a feast.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fording the river shallows, south by east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He hobbled now along a withered rill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That issued where old floods had gashed the hill⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cyclopean portal yawning sheer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No storm of countless hoofs had entered here:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed a place where nothing ever comes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But change of season. He could hear the plums</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plash in the frosted thicket, over-lush;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While, like a spirit lisping in the hush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crisp leaves whispered round him as they fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever now and then the autumn spell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was broken by an ululating cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where far back with muzzle to the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lone dog followed, mourning. Darkness came;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And huddled up beside a cozy flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh’s sleep was but a momentary flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across a little shadow into light.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So day on day he toiled: and when, afloat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the sunset like a stygian boat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The new moon bore the spectre of the old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw⁠—a dwindling strip of blue outrolled⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valley of the tortuous Cheyenne.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ere the half moon sailed the night again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those far lone leagues had sloughed their garb of blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dwindled, dwindled, dwindled after Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until he saw that Titan of the plains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sinewy Missouri. Dearth of rains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had made the Giant gaunt as he who saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This loud Chain-Smasher of a late March thaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed never to have bellowed at his banks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet, with staring ribs and hollow flanks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The urge of an indomitable will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proclaimed him of the breed of giants still;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where the current ran a boiling track,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas like the muscles of a mighty back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown Atlantean in the wrestler’s craft.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Hugh set to work and built a little raft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of driftwood bound with grapevines. So it fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That one with an amazing tale to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came drifting to the gates of Kiowa.</span>

					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>Not long Hugh let the lust of vengeance gnaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon him idling; though the tale he told</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what report proclaimed him, were as gold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To buy a winter’s comfort at the Post.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I can not rest; for I am but the ghost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of someone murdered by a friend,” he said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“So long as yonder traitor thinks me dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, buried in the bellies of the crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And kiotes!”</span>
							<span>Whereupon said one of those</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who heard him, noting how the old man shook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with a chill: “God fend that one should look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With such a blizzard of a face for me!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he went grayer like a poplar tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shivers, ruffling to the first faint breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of storm, while yet the world is still as death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save where, far off, the kenneled thunders bay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So brooding, he grew stronger day by day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until at last he laid the crutches by.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then one evening came a rousing cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where the year’s last keelboat hove in view</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around the bend, its swarthy, sweating crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Slant to the shouldered line.</span>
							<span>Men sang that night</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Kiowa, and by the ruddy light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of leaping fires amid the wooden walls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cups went round; and there were merry brawls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bearded lads no older for the beard;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And laughing stories vied with tales of weird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By stream and prairie trail and mountain pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the tipsy Bourgeois bawled for Glass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To “shame these with a man’s tale fit to hear.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The graybeard, sitting where the light was blear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With little heart for revelry, began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His story, told as of another man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, loving late, loved much and was betrayed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He spoke unwitting how his passion played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon them, how their eyes grew soft or hard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With what he told; yet something of the bard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed, and his the purpose that is art’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereby men make a vintage of their hearts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with the wine of beauty deaden pain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Low-toned, insistent as October rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His voice beat on; and now and then would flit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the melancholy gray of it</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A glimmer of cold fire that, like the flare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of soundless lightning, showed a world made bare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Green Summer slain and all its leafage stripped.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And bronze jaws tightened, brawny hands were gripped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though each hearer had a fickle friend.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the old man might have made an end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rounding the story to a peaceful close</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Kiowa, songlike his voice arose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grinning gray mask lifted and the eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Burned as a bard’s who sees and prophesies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conning the future as a time long gone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swaying to rhythm the dizzy tale plunged on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Even to the cutting of the traitor’s throat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ceased⁠—as though a bloody strangling smote</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The voice of that gray chanter, drunk with doom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was shuddering in the blue-smeared gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fallen fires. It seemed the deed was done</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Before their eyes who heard.</span>
							<span>The morrow’s sun,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Low over leagues of frost-enchanted plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw Glass upon his pilgrimage again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Northbound as hunter for the keelboat’s crew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many times the wide autumnal blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Burned out and darkened to a deep of stars;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still they toiled among the snags and bars⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those lean up-stream men, straining at the rope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lashed by the doubt and strengthened by the hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of backward winter⁠—engines wrought of bone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And muscle, panting for the Yellowstone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bend after bend and yet more bends away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now was the river like a sandy bay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At ebb-tide, and the far-off cutbank’s boom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mocked them in shallows; now ’twas like a flume</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With which the toilers, barely creeping, strove.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bend by bend the selfsame poplar grove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set on the selfsame headland, so it seemed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confronted them, as though they merely dreamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Of passing one drear point.</span>
							<span>So on and up</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past where the tawny Titan gulps the cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Cheyenne waters, past the Moreau’s mouth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still wry league and stubborn league fell south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becoming haze and weary memory.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then past the empty lodges of the Ree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gaped at cornfields plundered by the Sioux;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there old times came mightily on Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For much of him was born and buried there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some troubled glory of that wind-tossed hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was on the trampled corn; the lonely skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So haunted with the blue of Jamie’s eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed taunting him; and through the frosted wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the flat, where once their tent had stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A chill wind sorrowed, and the blackbirds’ brawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the funeral torches of the Fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran raucously, a desecrating din.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Past where the Cannon Ball and Heart come in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They labored. Now the Northwest ’woke at last.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gaunt bluffs bellowed back the trumpet blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of charging winds that made the sandbars smoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To breathe now was to gulp fine sand, and choke:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stinging air was sibilant with whips.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leaning the more and with the firmer grips,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still northward the embattled toilers pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the river yaws into the west.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>There stood the Mandan village.</span>
							<span>Now began</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chaining of the Titan. Drift-ice ran.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wingèd hounds of Winter ceased to bay.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stupor of a doom completed lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the world. The biting darkness fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out in the night, resounding as a well,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard the deck-planks popping in a vise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of frost; all night the smithies of the ice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reëchoed with the griding jar and clink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ghostly hammers welding link to link:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And morning found the world without a sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There lay the stubborn Prairie Titan bound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wait the far-off Heraclean thaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though still in silent rage he strove to gnaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ragged shackles knitting at his breast.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so the boatman won a winter’s rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Mandan traders: but for Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There yet remained a weary work to do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the naked country west by south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His purpose called him at the Big Horn’s mouth⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three hundred miles of winging for the crow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But by the river trail that he must go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas seven hundred winding miles at least.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So now he turned his back upon the feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snug ease, the pleasant tale, the merry mood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took the bare, foot-sounding solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Northwestward. Long they watched him from the Post,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Skied on a bluff-rim, fading like a ghost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At gray cock-crow; and hooded in his breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed indeed a fugitive from Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On whom some tatter of the shroud still clung.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Blank space engulfed him.</span>
							<span>Now the moon was young</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he set forth; and day by day he strode,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His scarce healed wounds upon him like a load;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dusk by dusk his fire out-flared the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That waxed until it wrought a spectral noon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At nightfall. Then he came to where, awhirl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Spring’s wild rage, the snow-born Titan girl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A skyey wonder on her virgin face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Receives the virile Yellowstone’s embrace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bears the lusty Seeker for the Sea.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bleak, horizon-wide serenity</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clung round the valley where the twain lay dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A winding sheet was on the marriage bed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas warmer now; the sky grew overcast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And as Hugh strode southwestward, all the vast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray void seemed suddenly astir with wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And multitudinary whisperings⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The muffled sibilance of tumbling snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed no more might living waters flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moon gleam, star glint, dawn smoulder through, bird sing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or ever any fair familiar thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be so again. The outworn winds were furled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weird weavers of the twilight of a world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrought, thread on kissing thread, the web of doom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown insubstantial in the knitted gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bluffs loomed eerie, and the scanty trees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were dwindled to remote dream-traceries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never might be green or shield a nest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All day with swinging stride Hugh forged southwest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Yellowstone’s smooth-paven stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dream-shape moving in a troubled dream;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all day long the whispering weavers wove.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And close on dark he came to where a grove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cottonwoods rose tall and shadow-thin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the northern bluffs. He camped therein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with cut boughs made shelter as he might.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Close pressed the blackness of the snow-choked night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About him, and his fire of plum wood purred.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Athwart a soft penumbral drowse he heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tumbling snowflakes sighing all around,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till sleep transformed it to a Summer sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of boyish memory⁠—susurrant bees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Southwind in the tousled apple trees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And slumber flowing from their leafy gloom.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He wakened to the cottonwoods’ deep boom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black fury was the world. The northwest’s roar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a surf upon a shipwreck shore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plunged high above him from the sheer bluff’s verge;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like the backward sucking of the surge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far fled the sobbing of the wild snow-spray.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Black blindness grew white blindness⁠—and ’twas day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All being now seemed narrowed to a span</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That held a sputtering wood fire and a man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond was tumult and a whirling maze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trees were but a roaring in a haze;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sheer bluff-wall that took the blizzard’s charge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was thunder flung along the hidden marge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of chaos, stridden by the ghost of light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White blindness grew black blindness⁠—and ’twas night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherethrough nor moon nor any star might grope.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Two days since, Hugh had killed an antelope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what remained sufficed the time of storm.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snow banked round his shelter kept him warm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was wood to burn for many a day.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The third dawn, oozing through a smudge of gray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awoke him. It was growing colder fast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still from the bluff high over boomed the blast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now it took the void with numbing wings.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By noon the woven mystery of things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Frayed raggedly, and through a sudden rift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At length Hugh saw the beetling bluff-wall lift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sturdy shoulder to the flying rack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slowly the sense of distances came back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with the waning day the great wind fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pale sun set upon a frozen hell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wolves howled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Hugh had left the Mandan town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, heifer-horned, the maiden moon lies down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the sea of evening. Now she rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scar-faced and staring blankly on the snows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While yet the twilight tarried in the west;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more and more she came a tardy guest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Hugh pushed onward through the frozen waste</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until she stole on midnight shadow-faced,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A haggard spectre; then no more appeared.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas on that time the man of hoary beard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Paused in the early twilight, looming lone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a bluff-rim of the Yellowstone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And peered across the white stream to the south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where in the flatland at the Big Horn’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The new fort stood that Henry’s men had built.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What perfect peace for such a nest of guilt!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What satisfied immunity from woe!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yon sprawling shadow, pied with candle-glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And plumed with sparkling woodsmoke, might have been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A homestead with the children gathered in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share its bounty through the holidays.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh saw their faces round the gay hearth-blaze:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hale old father in a mood for yarns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or boastful of the plenty of his barns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fruitage of honest toil and grateful lands;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, half a stranger to her folded hands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mother with October in her hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And August in her face. One moment there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh saw it. Then the monstrous brutal fact</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wiped out the dream and goaded him to act,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though now to act seemed strangely like a dream.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Descending from the bluff, he crossed the stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dry snow fifing to his eager stride.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reaching the fort stockade, he paused to bide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The passing of a whimsy. Was it true?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or was this but the fretted wraith of Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose flesh had fed the kiotes long ago?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Still through a chink he saw the candle-glow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So like an eye that brazened out a wrong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now there came a flight of muffled song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rhythmic thudding of a booted heel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That timed a squeaking fiddle to a reel!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How swiftly men forget! The spawning Earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is fat with graves; and what is one man worth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fiddles should be muted at his fall?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He should have died and did not⁠—that was all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well, let the living jig it! He would turn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back to the night, the spacious unconcern</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wilderness that never played the friend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now came the song and fiddling to an end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And someone laughed within. The old man winced,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Listened with bated breath, and was convinced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas Jamie laughing! Once again he heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Joy filled a hush ’twixt heart-beats like a bird;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then like a famished cat his lurking hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Pounced crushingly.</span>
							<span>He found the outer gate,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beat on it with his shoulder, raised a cry.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No doubt ’twas deemed a fitful wind went by;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>None stirred. But when he did not cease to shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A door creaked open and a man came out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the spilling candle-glimmer, raised</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wicket in the outer gate and gazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One moment on a face as white as death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the beard was thick with frosted breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made mystic by the stars. Then came a gasp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clatter of the falling wicket’s hasp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crunch of panic feet along the snow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And someone stammered huskily and low:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“My God! I saw the Old Man’s ghost out there!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas spoken as one speaks who feels his hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prickle the scalp. And then another said⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed like Henry’s voice⁠—“The dead are dead:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What talk is this, Le Bon? You saw him die!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Who’s there?”</span>
							<span>Hugh strove to shout, to give the lie</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To those within; but could not fetch a sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just so he dreamed of lying under ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the Grand and hearing overhead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The talk of men. Or was he really dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all this but a maggot in the brain?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then suddenly the clatter of a chain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused him, and he saw the portal yawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw a bright rectangled patch of dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As through a grave’s mouth⁠—no, ’twas candlelight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Poured through the open doorway on the night;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those were men before him, bulking black</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Against the glow.</span>
							<span>Reality flashed back;</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He strode ahead and entered at the door.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A falling fiddle jangled on the floor</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left a deathly silence. On his bench</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fiddler shrank. A row of eyes, a-blench</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With terror, ran about the naked hall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was one who huddled by the wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And hid his face and shivered.</span>
							<span>For a spell</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That silence clung; and then the old man: “Well,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is this the sort of welcome that I get?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas not my time to feed the kiotes yet!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put on the pot and stew a chunk of meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And you shall see how much a ghost can eat!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ve journeyed far if what I hear be true!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now in that none might doubt the voice of Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor yet the face, however it might seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A blurred reflection in a flowing stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A buzz of wonder broke the trance of dread.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Good God!” the Major gasped; “We thought you dead!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two men have testified they saw you die!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“If they speak truth,” Hugh answered, “then I lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both here and by the Grand. If I be right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then two lie here and shall lie from this night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Which are they?”</span>
							<span>Henry answered: “Yon is one.”</span>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The old man set the trigger of his gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gazed on Jules who cowered by the wall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eyes blinked, expectant of the hammer’s fall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ears strained, anticipative of the roar.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Hugh walked leisurely across the floor</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kicked the croucher, saying: “Come, get up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wag your tail! I couldn’t kill a pup!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then turning round: “I had a faithful friend;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No doubt he too was with me to the end!</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Where’s Jamie?”</span>
							<span>“Started out before the snows</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Atkinson.”</span>

						<span class="i8">The Country of the Crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which the Big Horn and the Rosebud run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sees over mountain peaks the setting sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And southward from the Yellowstone flung wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It broadens ever to the morning side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And has the Powder on its vague frontier.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the subtle changing of the year,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere even favored valleys felt the stir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Spring, and yet expectancy of her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a pleasant rumor all repeat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet none may prove, the sound of horses’ feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went eastward through the silence of that land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For then it was there rode a little band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of trappers out of Henry’s Post, to bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dispatches down to Atkinson, and there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To furnish out a keelboat for the Horn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And four went lightly, but the fifth seemed worn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with a heavy heart; for that was he</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Who should have died but did not.</span>
							<span>Silently</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He heard the careless parley of his men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thought of how the Spring should come again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That garish strumpet with her world-old lure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To waken hope where nothing may endure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To quicken love where loving is betrayed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet now and then some dream of Jamie made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow music in him for a little while;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they who rode beside him saw a smile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Glimmer upon that ruined face of gray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As on a winter fog the groping day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pours glory through a momentary rift.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet never did the gloom that bound him, lift;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed as one who feeds upon his heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And finds, despite the bitter and the smart,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little sweetness and is glad for that.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now up the Powder, striking for the Platte</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the bleak divide the horsemen went;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attained that river where its course is bent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From north to east: and spurring on apace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the wintry valley, reached the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where from the west flows in the Laramie.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thence, fearing to encounter with the Ree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They headed eastward through the barren land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where, fleet-footed down a track of sand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Niobrara races for the morn⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gaunt-loined runner.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Here at length was born</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the southern slopes the baby Spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A timid, fretful, ill-begotten thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-suckle at the Winter’s withered paps:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not such as when announced by thunder-claps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ringed with swords of lightning, she would ride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The haughty victrix and the mystic bride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clad splendidly as never Sheba’s Queen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before her marching multitudes of green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In many-bannered triumph! Grudging, slow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the fraying fringes of the snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bunchgrass sprouted; and the air was chill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the northern slopes ’twas winter still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no root dreamed what Triumph-over-Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was nurtured now in some bleak Nazareth</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Beyond the crest to sunward.</span>
							<span>On they spurred</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through vacancies that waited for the bird,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And everywhere the Odic Presence dwelt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Southwest blew, the snow began to melt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they reached the valley of the Snake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Niobrara’s ice began to break,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all night long and all day long it made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sound as of a random cannonade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With rifles snarling down a skirmish line.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The geese went over. Every tree and vine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was dotted thick with leaf-buds when they saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little river of Keyapaha</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown mighty for the moment. Then they came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One evening when all thickets were aflame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With pale green witch-fires and the windflowers blew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the headlong Niobrara threw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His speed against the swoln Missouri’s flank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hurled him roaring to the further bank⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A giant staggered by a pygmy’s sling.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thence, plunging ever deeper into Spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the greening prairie east by south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They rode, and, just above the Platte’s wide mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came, weary with the trail, to Atkinson.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>There all the vernal wonder-work was done:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No care-free heart might find aught lacking there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dove’s call wandered in the drowsy air;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A love-dream brooded in the lucent haze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Priapic revellers, the shrieking jays</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held mystic worship in the secret shade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Woodpeckers briskly plied their noisy trade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the tree-boles, and their scarlet hoods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flashed flamelike in the smoky cottonwoods.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What lacked? Not sweetness in the sun-lulled breeze;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The plum bloom murmurous with bumblebees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was drifted deep in every draw and slough.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not color; witcheries of gold and blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dandelion and the violet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wove in the green. Might not the sad forget,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The happy here have nothing more to seek?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lo, yonder by that pleasant little creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How one might loll upon the grass and fish</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And build the temple of one’s wildest wish</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt nibbles! Surely there was quite enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wizard-timber and of wonder-stuff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rear it nobly to the blue-domed roof!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yet there was one whose spirit stood aloof</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From all this joyousness⁠—a gray old man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No nearer now than when the quest began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To what he sought on that long winter trail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Aye, Jamie had been there; but when the tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That roving trappers brought from Kiowa</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was told to him, he seemed as one who saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ghost, and could but stare on it, they said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until one day he mounted horse and fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the North, a devil-ridden man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I’ve got to go and find him if I can,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was all he said for days before he left.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And what of Hugh? So long of love bereft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So long sustained and driven by his hate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A touch of ruth now made him desolate.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No longer eager to avenge the wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With not enough of pity to be strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And just enough of love to choke and sting,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gray old hulk amid the surge of Spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He floundered on a lee-shore of the heart.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when the boat was ready for the start</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up the long watery stairway to the Horn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hugh joined the party. And the year was shorn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of blooming girlhood as they forged amain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into the North; the late green-mantled plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew sallow; and the ruthless golden shower</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Summer wrought in lust upon the flower</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That withered in the endless martyrdom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To seed. The scarlet quickened on the plum</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the Heart’s mouth when they came thereto;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Mandans grapes were turning blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they were purple at the Yellowstone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A frosted scrub-oak, standing out alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a barren bluff top, gazing far</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the crossing at the Powder’s bar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was spattered with the blood of Summer slain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So it was Autumn in the world again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all those months of toil had yielded nought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Hugh. (How often is the seeker sought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By what he seeks⁠—a blind, heart-breaking game!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For always had the answer been the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From roving trapper and at trading post:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, one who seemed to stare upon a ghost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And followed willy-nilly where it led,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had gone that way in search of Hugh, they said⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A haggard, blue-eyed, yellow-headed chap.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And often had the old man thought, “Mayhap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’ll be at Henry’s Post and we shall meet;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to forgive and to forget were sweet:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis for its nurse that Vengeance whets the tooth!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And oh the golden time of Jamie’s youth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That it should darken for a graybeard’s whim!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Hugh had brooded, till there came on him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pity of a slow rain after drouth.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But at the crossing of the Rosebud’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shadow fell upon his growing dream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A band of Henry’s traders, bound down stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who paused to traffic in the latest word⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down-river news for matters seen and heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In higher waters⁠—had not met the lad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not yet encountered anyone who had.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Alas, the journey back to yesterwhiles!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How tangled are the trails! The stubborn miles,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How wearily they stretch! And if one win</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long way back in search of what has been,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall he find aught that is not strange and new?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus wrought the melancholy news in Hugh,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he turned back with those who brought the news;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For more and more he dreaded now to lose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What doubtful seeking rendered doubly dear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the time when keen winds stripped the year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He came with those to where the Poplar joins</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The greater river. There Assinoboines,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rich from the Summer’s hunting, had come down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flung along the flat their ragged town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That traders might bring goods and winter there.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So leave the heartsick graybeard. Otherwhere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The final curtain rises on the play.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis dead of Winter now. For day on day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blizzard wind has thundered, sweeping wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Mississippi to the Great Divide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the North beyond Saskatchewan.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brief evening glimmers like an inverse dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>After a long white night. The tempest dies;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snow-haze lifts. Now let the curtain rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon Milk River valley, and reveal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stars like broken glass on frosted steel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the Piegan lodges, huddled deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In snowdrifts, like a freezing flock of sheep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crystal weight the dread cold crushes down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no one moves about the little town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seems to grovel as a thing that fears.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But see! a lodge-flap swings; a squaw appears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hunched with the sudden cold. Her footsteps creak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrill in the hush. She stares upon the bleak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White skyline for a moment, then goes in.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We follow her, push back the flap of skin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enter the lodge, inhale the smoke-tanged air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And blink upon the little faggot-flare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That blossoms in the center of the room.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unsteady shadows haunt the outer gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein the walls are guessed at. Upward, far,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smoke-vent now and then reveals a star</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in a well. The ancient squaw, a-stoop,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her face light-stricken, stirs a pot of soup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That simmers with a pleasant smell and sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gnarled old man, cross-legged upon the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sits brooding near. He feeds the flame with sticks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It brightens. Lo, a leaden crucifix</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the wall! These heathen eyes, though dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have seen the white man’s God and cling to Him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest on the sunset trail slow feet should err.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But look again. From yonder bed of fur</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the wall a white man strives to rise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He lifts his head, with yearning sightless eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gropes for the light. A mass of golden hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Falls round the face that sickness and despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Somehow make old, albeit he is young.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His weak voice, stumbling to the mongrel tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of traders, flings a question to the squaw:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“You saw no Black Robe? Tell me what you saw!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And she, brief-spoken as her race, replies:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Heaped snow⁠—sharp stars⁠—a kiote on the rise.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The blind youth huddles moaning in the furs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The firewood spits and pops, the boiled pot purrs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sputters. On this little isle of sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sea of winter silence presses round⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>One feels it like a menace.</span>
							<span>Now the crone</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dips out a cup of soup, and having blown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon it, takes it to the sick man there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bids him eat. With wild, unseeing stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He turns upon her: “Why are they so long?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I can not eat! I’ve done a mighty wrong;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It chokes me! Oh no, no, I must not die</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the Black Robe comes!” His feeble cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sinks to a whisper. “Tell me, did they go⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Your kinsmen?”</span>
							<span>“They went south before the snow.”</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>“And will they tell the Black Robe?”</span>
							<span>“They will tell.”</span>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The crackling of the faggots for a spell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seems very loud. Again the sick man moans</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, struggling with the weakness in his bones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would gain his feet, but can not. “Go again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tell me that you see the bulks of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Dim in the distance there.”</span>
							<span>The squaw obeys;</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Returns anon to crouch beside the blaze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Numb-fingered and a-shudder from the night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The vacant eyes that hunger for the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are turned upon her: “Tell me what you saw!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or maybe snowshoes sounded up the draw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quick, tell me what you saw and heard out there!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Heaped snow⁠—sharp stars⁠—big stillness everywhere.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One clutching at thin ice with numbing grip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cries while he hopes; but when his fingers slip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He takes the final plunge without a sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So sinks the youth now, hopeless. All around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The winter silence presses in; the walls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grow vague and vanish in the gloom that crawls</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Close to the failing fire.</span>
							<span>The Piegans sleep.</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Night hovers midway down the morning steep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sick man drowses. Nervously he starts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And listens; hears no sound except his heart’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that weird murmur brooding stillness makes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But stealthily upon the quiet breaks⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vague as the coursing of the hearer’s blood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A muffled, rhythmic beating, thud on thud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, growing nearer, deepens to a crunch.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, hungry for the distance, snowshoes munch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crusted leagues of Winter, stride by stride.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A camp-dog barks; the hollow world outside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brims with the running howl of many curs.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now wide-awake, half risen in the furs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The youth can hear low voices and the creak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of snowshoes near the lodge. His thin, wild shriek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Startles the old folk from their slumberings:</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>“He comes! The Black Robe!”</span>
							<span>Now the door-flap swings,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And briefly one who splutters Piegan, bars</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way, then enters. Now the patch of stars</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is darkened with a greater bulk that bends</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the lintel. “Peace be with you, friends!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And peace with him herein who suffers pain!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So speaks the second comer of the twain⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A white man by his voice. And he who lies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the wall, with empty, groping eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned to the speaker: “There can be no peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For me, good Father, till this gnawing cease⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gnawing of a great wrong I have done.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The big man leans above the youth: “My son⁠—”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Grown husky with the word, the deep voice breaks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for a little spell the whole man shakes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with the clinging cold) “⁠—have faith and hope!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis often nearest dawn when most we grope.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Does not the Good Book say, Who seek shall find?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“But, Father, I am broken now and blind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I have sought, and I have lost the way.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To which the stranger: “What would Jesus say?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hark! In the silence of the heart ’tis said⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By their own weakness are the feeble sped;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The humblest feet are surest for the goal;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blind shall see the City of the Soul.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay down your burden at His feet tonight.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now while the fire, replenished, bathes in light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young face scrawled with suffering and care,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flinging ironic glories on the hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And glinting on dull eyes that once flashed blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sick one tells the story of old Hugh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To him whose face, averted from the glow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still lurks in gloom. The winds of battle blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more along the steep. Again one sees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rescue from the fury of the Rees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The graybeard’s fondness for the gay lad; then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The westward march with Major Henry’s men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all that happened there upon the Grand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“And so we hit the trail of Henry’s band,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The youth continues; “for we feared to die:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dread of shame was ready with the lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We carried to our comrades. Hugh was dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And buried there beside the Grand, we said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could any doubt that what we said was true?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They even praised our courage! But I knew!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nights were hell because I heard his cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw the crows a-pecking at his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kiotes tearing at him. O my God!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I tried and tried to think him under sod;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But every time I slept it was the same.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then one night⁠—I lay awake⁠—he came!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I say he came⁠—I know I hadn’t slept!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid a light like rainy dawn, he crept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the dark upon his hands and knees.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wound he got that day among the Rees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like red fire. A snarl of bloody hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung round the eyes that had a pleading stare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And down the ruined face and gory beard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big tear-drops rolled. He went as he appeared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trailing a fog of light that died away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I grew old before I saw the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O Father, I had paid too much for breath!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Devil traffics in the fear of death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And may God pity anyone who buys</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What I have bought with treachery and lies⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This rat-like gnawing in my breast!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">“I knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I couldn’t rest until I buried Hugh;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so I told the Major I would go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Atkinson with letters, ere the snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had choked the trails. Jules wouldn’t come along;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He didn’t seem to realize the wrong;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He called me foolish, couldn’t understand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I rode alone⁠—not south, but to the Grand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Daylong my horse beat thunder from the sod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accusing me; and all my prayers to God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed flung in vain at bolted gates of brass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the night the wind among the grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hissed endlessly the story of my shame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“I do not know how long I rode: I came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Grand at last, and found the place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And it was empty. Not a sign or trace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was left to show what end had come to Hugh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And oh that grave! It gaped upon the blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A death-wound pleading dumbly for the slain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I filled it up and fled across the plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And somehow came to Atkinson at last.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there I heard the living Hugh had passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the river northward in the Fall!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O Father, he had found the strength to crawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That long, heart-breaking distance back to life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though Jules had taken blanket, steel and knife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I, his trusted comrade, had his gun!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“They said I’d better stay at Atkinson,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because old Hugh was surely hunting me,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White-hot to kill. I did not want to flee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or hide from him. I even wished to die,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If so this aching cancer of a lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might be torn out forever. So I went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As eager as the homesick homeward bent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>In search of him and peace.</span>
							<span>But I was cursed.</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For even when his stolen rifle burst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spewed upon me this eternal night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I might not die as any other might;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But God so willed that friendly Piegans came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To spare me yet a little unto shame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O Father, is there any hope for me?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Great hope indeed, my son!” so huskily</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other answers. “I recall a case</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like yours⁠—no matter what the time and place⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas somewhat like the story that you tell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each seeking and each sought, and both in hell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in the tale I mind, they met at last.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The youth sits up, white-faced and breathing fast:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“They met, you say? What happened? Quick! Oh quick!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“The old man found the dear lad blind and sick</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And both forgave⁠—’twas easy to forgive⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For oh we have so short a time to live⁠—”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat the youth: “Who’s here? The Black Robe’s gone!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose voice is this?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">The gray of winter dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now creeping round the door-flap, lights the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shows thin fingers groping for a face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep-scarred and hoary with the frost of years</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereover runs a new springtide of tears.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“O Jamie, Jamie, Jamie⁠—I am Hugh!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was no Black Robe yonder⁠—Will I do?”</span>

				<h3 epub:type="title">To Alice, Three Years Old</h3>
				<p>
					<span>When I began the gift I bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed you weren’t anywhere;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But being younger now I know</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How even fifty moons ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The apple bloom began to seek</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The proper tinting for a cheek;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The skies, aware of thrilling news,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Displayed the loveliest of blues</span>
					<br/>

				<h3 epub:type="title">Preface</h3>
				<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of the Indian Wars</i> is a part of the Epic Cycle of the West upon which I have been working for eleven years. However, as the reader will note, it is complete in itself, as are the two other parts of the Cycle already published. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Three Friends</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Hugh Glass</i>.</p>
				<p>My purpose in writing this cycle is to preserve the great race-mood of courage that was developed west of the Missouri River in the 19th century. The period with which I am dealing is beyond question the great American epic period, beginning in 1822 and ending in 1890. The dates are neither approximate nor arbitrary. In 1822 the first Ashley-Henry band ascended the Missouri and, after Lewis and Clark, the most important explorers of the West were Ashley-Henry men. As to the exploits of those men and the epic nature of the period, the interested reader is referred to the prefatory matter of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Three Friends</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Hugh Glass</i> in the Modern Readers’ Series; also to my volume entitled The Splendid Wayfaring. The year 1890 marked the end of Indian resistance on the Plains.</p>
				<p>In working out my plan for the cycle I have yet to deal with the period of exploration and the period of migration.</p>
				<p><i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of the Indian Wars</i> deals with the last great fight for the bison pastures of the Plains between the westering white men and the prairie tribes⁠—the struggle for the right of way between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean. Since the period was one of crucial importance in the process of our national development, I have felt the obligation to be accurate. I have neither fictionized my material nor sentimentalized my characters. It seems unnecessary to list all the printed sources upon which I have drawn during the years I have devoted to the subject. The list would be long, and I doubt if any work of considerable significance bearing on the period has escaped me, whether a government report, a formal history or a personal narrative. But one can not safely trust the printed sources alone, and I have made it a duty to consult many veterans who were themselves a part of what I have to tell. Among these I am especially indebted to the following:</p>
				<p>Brigadier-General Anson Mills of Washington, <abbr>D. C.</abbr>, who served with conspicuous gallantry under Crook both in the Rosebud fight and in the Battle of Slim Buttes; Brigadier-General Edward <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Godfrey of Cookston, <abbr>N. J.</abbr>, who distinguished himself in the Reno battle on the Little Big Horn; Brigadier-General Walter <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">S.</abbr> Schuyler of San Francisco, who served under Crook and rendered brilliant service under Mackenzie in the winter battle with the Cheyennes on Willow Creek; Brigadier-General Charles King of Milwaukee, the famous soldier-novelist, who was one of Crook’s lieutenants in the campaign of 1876; Major Henry <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Lemly of Washington, <abbr>D. C.</abbr>, who was Crook’s Acting Assistant Adjutant General during the famous “horse-meat march” in pursuit of the Indians after the Custer fight, and who witnessed the death of Crazy Horse; Colonel Homer <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">W.</abbr> Wheeler of Los Angeles, rich in experience as a plainsman and as an Indian fighter; the late Captain Grant <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">P.</abbr> Marsh of Bismarck, <abbr>N. D.</abbr>, who was in command of the steamer Far West during the campaign of 1876 and transported the wounded of Reno’s command from the mouth of the Little Big Horn to Fort Abraham Lincoln; Captain James <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">H.</abbr> Cook of Agate, Nebraska, famous plainsman and army scout, intimate friend of the great Chief Red Cloud and of most of the other notable Sioux Leaders; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> George <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Forsyth of Wilkes-Barre, <abbr>Penn.</abbr>, wife of the late Brigadier-General George <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Forsyth, the hero of Beecher’s Island; Captain Howard Morton of Palo Alto, California, who fought with Forsyth on the Rickaree Fork of the Republican and who still carries the bullet that tore out one of his eyes in that wonderful little battle; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> William <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">C.</abbr> Slaper of Los Angeles, who served as a private under Reno in the Battle of the Little Big Horn; Sergeant Max Littman of <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis and Sergeant Samuel Gibson of Omaha, both of whom were in the Wagon Box fight; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Wallace of Okarche, <abbr>Okla.</abbr>, who was one of Custer’s scouts in the winter campaign ending with the Battle of the Washita; <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> John Hunton, still living at old Fort Laramie where he was post trader in the ’sixties; Red Hawk, an Ogalala Sioux, who knew and fought with Crazy Horse; my “brother-friend,” Curly, one of Custer’s Crow scouts, who told me only the truth, however lustily he may have drawn the long bow for the amazement of over credulous journalists.</p>
				<p>Indirectly I have gotten much valuable material out of the Indian consciousness through those who were intimately acquainted with the Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapahoe during the period of the last wars. Also much valuable reminiscence of white men, other than those named, has been made accessible to me by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">E. A.</abbr> Brininstool of Los Angeles, whose extensive collection of source material bearing on the Indian Wars has cost him many years of effort and is equalled by few private collections of the sort in the country. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Grace <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">R.</abbr> Hebard of the University of Wyoming, coauthor with <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Brininstool of the Bozeman Trail, a work of the highest authority on the Red Cloud Wars, gave me generous and timely aid by placing important original documents in my hands before the publication of the volume named. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Doane Robinson of Pierre, Secretary of the State Historical Society of South Dakota and a high authority on the whole history of the Plains, has further increased my debt to him, a debt of long standing.</p>
				<p>For some of the Indian speeches I am indebted to the works of <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Dr.</abbr> Charles <abbr epub:type="z3998:given-name">A.</abbr> Eastman, who, himself a Sioux, was intimately acquainted with many of the great leaders of his people.</p>
				<p>My years of intimate association with the Omaha Tribe, a Siouan people, at a time when the old generation was still numerous, may have given me some insight into Indian psychology.</p>
				<p>As to the country in which my story moves, I have reason to know it well. My acquaintance with it began thirty-seven years ago when I lived with my pioneering grandparents in Kansas on the upper Solomon. Signs of the vanished buffalo were still there, and I have sat by cowchip fires. Also, I have taken the trouble to study at first hand the topography of the various localities and stretches of country that I have undertaken to describe.</p>
				<p>Since my interest in the period treated is not of recent origin, it is impossible to give credit to all who, in one way or another, have helped me; but the foregoing will serve to indicate the means employed by way of getting at the truth and into the mood of the time.</p>
				<p>Wherever I have found various versions of particular incidents I have been careful to adopt that one which seemed best supported by the evidence. Perhaps the greatest variation of testimony is to be found in the matter of Custer’s last battle. I may say that I am quite familiar with the controversy; nor should those who may resent my account as that of a Custer partisan accuse me of having never seen the report of the Reno investigation. I spent a wonderful day and night with it and I found it a rich mine for the psychologist.</p>
				<p>In the interval between a four and a half year task just finished and another soon to be assumed, I may be allowed the satisfaction of noting the steadily increasing success of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Three Friends</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Hugh Glass</i>, both with the general public and in the public schools and colleges. Already the progress made would seem to justify me in devoting my twenty best years to the Cycle.</p>

						<p epub:type="title">The Sowing of the Dragon</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>At last the four year storm of fratricide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had ceased at Appomattox, and the tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of war-bit myriads, like a turning sea’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recoiled upon the deep realities</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That yield no foam to any squall of change.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now many a hearth of home had gotten strange</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eyes that knew sky-painting flares of war.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So much that once repaid the striving for</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No longer mattered. Yonder road that ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At hazard once beyond the ways of Man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By haunted vale and space-enchanted hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had never dreamed of aught but Jones’s Mill⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dull pedestrian! The spring, where erst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The peering plowboy sensed a larger thirst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had shoaled from awe, so long the man had drunk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At deeper floods. How yonder field had shrunk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That billowed once mysteriously far</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the cow-lot nursed the evening star</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And neighbored with the drowsing moon and sun!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For O what winds of wrath had boomed and</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across what vaster fields of moaning grain⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rich seedings, nurtured by a ghastly rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To woeful harvest!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">So the world went small.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ’mid the wreck of things remembered tall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An epidemic rumor murmured now.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men leaned upon the handles of the plow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hear and dream; and through the harrow-smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The weird voice muttered and the vision broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of distant, princely acres unpossessed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Again the bugles of the Race blew west</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That once the Tigris and Euphrates heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In unsuspected deeps of being stirred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ancient and compelling Aryan urge.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A homing of the homeless, surge on surge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valley roads ran wagons, and the hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through lane and by-way fed with trickling rills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man-stream mighty with a mystic thaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All summer now the Mississippi saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What long ago the Hellespont beheld.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shrewd, prophetic eyes that peered of eld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the Danube, visioned naked plains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the bleak Missouri, clad with grains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jewelled with orchard, grove and greening garth⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serene abundance centered in a hearth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To nurture lusty children.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">On they swirled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The driving breed, the takers of the world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The makers and the bringers of the law.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now up along the bottoms of the Kaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drifting reek of wheel and hoof arose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kiotes talked about it and the crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the lone Republican; and still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bison saw it on the Smoky Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Solomon; while yonder on the Platte</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten thousand wagons scarred the sandy flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the green grass season and the brown.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A name sufficed to make the camp a town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A whim unmade. In spaces wide as air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And late as empty, now the virile share</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quickened the virgin meadowlands of God;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo, begotten of the selfsame sod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The house and harvest!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">So the Cadmian breed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wedders of the vision and the deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went forth to sow the dragon-seed again.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But there were those⁠—and they were also men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who saw the end of sacred things and dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all this wild beginning; saw with fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ancestral pastures gutted by the plow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bison harried ceaselessly, and how</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They dwindled moon by moon; with pious dread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld the holy places of their dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mock of aliens.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Sioux, Arapahoe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cheyenne, Commanche, Kiowa and Crow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In many a council pondered what befell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie world. Along the Musselshell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Tongue, the Niobrara, all they said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Platte, the Arkansaw, the Red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was echoed word by peril-laden word.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along Popo Agie<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1" id="noteref-1" epub:type="noteref">1</a> and the Horn they heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clank of hammers and the clang of rails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where hordes of white men conjured iron trails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now crawling past the Loup Fork and the Blue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By desert-roaming Cimarron they knew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where La Poudre heads the tale was known,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How, snoring up beyond the Yellowstone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The medicine-canoes breathed flame and steam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like weird monsters of an evil dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spewed foes⁠—a multitudinary spawn!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Were all the teeming regions of the dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unpeopled now? What devastating need</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had set so many faces pale with greed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the sunset? Not as men who seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some meed of kindness, suppliant and meek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These hungry myriads came. They did but look,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whatsoever pleased them, that they took.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their faded eyes were icy, lacking ruth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all their tongues were forked to split the truth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That word and deed might take diverging ways.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bewildered in the dusk of ancient days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Red Men groped; and howsoever loud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hopeful hotheads boasted in the crowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wise ones heard prophetic whisperings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through aching hushes; felt the end of things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inexorably shaping. What should be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already was to them. And who can flee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His shadow or his doom? Though cowards stride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wind-wild thunder-horses, Doom shall ride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The arrows of the lightning, and prevail.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere long whole tribes must take the spirit trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As once they travelled to the bison hunt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then let it be with many wounds⁠—in front⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many scalps, to show their ghostly kin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How well they fought the fight they could not win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To perish facing what they could not kill.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So down upon the Platte and Smoky Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swept war; and all their valleys were afraid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The workers where the trails were being laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To speed the iron horses, now must get</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their daily wage in blood as well as sweat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gun and shovel. Often staring plains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld at daybreak gutted wagon-trains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set foursquare to the whirling night-attack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With neither hoof nor hand to bring them back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Omaha or Westport. Every week</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The roiling coaches bound for Cherry Creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were scarred in running battle. Every day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some ox-rig, creeping California way⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That paradise of every hope fulfilled⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was plundered and the homesick driver killed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forlornly fighting for his little brood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And often was the prairie solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aware by night of burning ricks and roofs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stampeding cattle and the fleeing hoofs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wild marauders.</span>

						<span class="i10">Sullenly a gale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That blustered rainless up the Bozeman Trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was bringing June again; but not the dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep-bosomed mother of a hemisphere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That other regions cherish. Flat of breast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More passionate than loving, up the West</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stern June strode, lean suckler of the lean,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her rag-and-tatter robe of faded green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blown dustily about her.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now held the dazzled prairie in a swoon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where the Platte and Laramie unite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The naked heavens slanted blinding light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the bare Fort Laramie parade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The groping shadow-arm the flag-pole swayed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To nightward, served to emphasize the glare;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ’mid Saharan hollows of the air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One haughty flower budded from the mast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bloomed and withered as the gale soughed past</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To languish in the swelter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Growing loud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When some objection wakened in the crowd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or dwindling to a murmur of assent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still on and on the stubborn parley went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many treaty makers gathered here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big talk there was at Laramie that year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ’sixty-six; for lo, a mighty word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Great White Father spoke, and it was heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From peep of morning to the sunset fires.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The southwind took it from the talking wires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gave it to the gusty west that blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its meaning down the country of the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Inyan Kara to Missouri’s tide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The eager eastwind took and flung it wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where lush valleys gaze at lofty snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All summer long. And now Arapahoe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The word was; now Dakota; now Cheyenne;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still one word: “Let grass be green again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the trails of war and hatred cease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For many presents and the pipe of peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are waiting yonder at the Soldier’s Town!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there were some who heard it with a frown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said, remembering the White Man’s guile:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Make yet more arrows when the foemen smile.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And others, wise with many winters, said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Life narrows, and the better days are dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make war upon the sunset! Will it stay?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some who counselled with a dream would say:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Great Spirit made all peoples. White and Red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pitched one big blue teepee overhead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That men might live as brothers side by side.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold! Is not our country very wide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With room enough for all?” And there were some</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who answered scornfully: “Not so they come;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their medicine is strong, their hearts are bad;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little part of what our fathers had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They give us now, tomorrow come and take.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great Spirit also made the rattlesnake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over him the big blue teepee set!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So wrought the Great White Father’s word; and yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite remembered and suspected wrong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the Long Knife’s medicine was strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their lacked not mighty chieftains who obeyed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand Ogalalas Man Afraid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Red Cloud marshalled on the council trail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand Brulés followed Spotted Tail.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cheyennes, Arapahoes came riding down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By hundreds; till the little Soldier Town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was big with teepees.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Where the white June drowse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beat slanting through a bower of withered boughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cast a fretwork travesty of shade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now sat the peace-commissioners and made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soft words to woo the chieftains of the bands.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“They wanted but a roadway through the lands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein the Rosebud, Tongue and Powder head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That white men, seeking for the yellow lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Madison, might pass that way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There ran the shortest trail by many a day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of weary travel. This could do no harm;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor would there be occasion for alarm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If they should wish to set a fort or two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up yonder⁠—not against Cheyenne and Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather that the Great White Father’s will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might be a curb upon his people still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Red Men’s rights be guarded by the laws.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Adroitly phrased, with many a studied pause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which the half-breed spokesmen, bit by bit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reshaped the alien speech and scattered it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The purpose of the council swept at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the lounging crowd. And where it passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The feathered headgear swayed and bent together</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With muttering, as when in droughty weather</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little whirlwind sweeps the tasseled corn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some bull-lunged Ogalala’s howl of scorn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was hurled against the few assenting “hows”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Brulés. Then the summer drowse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came back, the vibrant silence of the heat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Man Afraid had gotten to his feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His face set hard, one straight arm rising slow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the Whites, as though he bent a bow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yonder should the fleshing arrow fly.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So stood he, and the moments creeping by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were big with expectation. Still and tense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The council felt the wordless eloquence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Man Afraid; and then:</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">“I tell you no!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Harney talked to us ten snows ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gave us all that country. Now you say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The White Chief lied. My heart is bad today,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because I know too well the forkèd tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That makes a promise when the moon is young,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kills it when the moon is in the dark!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The Ogalalas roared; and like a spark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That crawls belated when the fuse is damp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The words woke sequent thunders through the camp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Cheyennes heard it and Arapahoes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then once again the chieftain’s voice arose:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Your talk is sweet today. So ever speak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The white men when they know their hands are weak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That itch to steal. But once your soldiers pitch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their teepees yonder, will the same hands itch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The less for being stronger? Go around.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I do not want you in my hunting ground!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You scare my bison, and my folk must eat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far sweeter than your words are, home is sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To us, as you; and yonder land is home.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In sheltered valleys elk and bison roam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All winter there, and in the spring are fat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We gave the road you wanted up the Platte.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make dust upon it then! But you have said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shortest way to find the yellow lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Runs yonder. Any trail is short enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That leads your greedy people to the stuff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That makes them crazy! It is bad for you.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I, Man Afraid, have spoken. <i xml:lang="sio">Hetchetu!</i>”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span><em>How, how, how, how!</em> A howl of fighting men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swept out across the crowd and back again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To break about the shadow-mottled stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Colonel Maynadier, with lifted hand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaited silence. “As a soldier should,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He spoke straight words and few. His heart was good.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Great White Father would be very sad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To know the heart of Man Afraid was bad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how his word was called a crooked word.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It could not be that Man Afraid had heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The council had not said that Harney lied.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It wanted but a little road, as wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As that a wagon makes from wheel to wheel.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Long Knife chieftains had not come to steal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Red Men’s hunting ground.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">The half-breeds cried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The speech abroad; but where it fell, it died.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One heard the flag a-ripple at the mast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bicker of the river flowing past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The melancholy crooning of the gale.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now ’mid the bodeful silence, Spotted Tail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose, and all the people leaned to hear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For was he not a warrior and a seer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose deeds were mighty as his words were wise?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some droll, shrewd spirit in his narrowed eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed peering past the moment and afar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where predestined things already are;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And humor lurked beneath the sober mien,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But half concealed, as though the doom foreseen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Revealed the old futility of tears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembering the story of his years,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His Brulé warriors loved him standing so.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some recalled that battle long ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far off beside the upper Arkansaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, like the freshet of a sudden thaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Utes came down; and how the Brulés, caught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In ambush, sang the death-song as they fought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For many were the foes and few were they;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet Spotted Tail, a stripling fresh from play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had saved them with his daring and his wit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How often when the dark of dawn was lit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With flaming wagon-tops, his battle-cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had made it somehow beautiful to die,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A whirlwind joy! And how the leaping glare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had shown by fits the snow-fall of despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the white men’s faces! Well they knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That every brave who followed him was two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So mighty was the magic of his name.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And none forgot the first time Harney came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His whetted deaths that chattered in the sheath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long blue snake that set the ground beneath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-smoulder with a many-footed rage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What bleeding of the Brulés might assuage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That famished fury? Vain were cunning words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pay the big arrears for harried herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And desolated homes and settlers slain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a looted coach and wagon-train</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that sweat of terror in the land!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who now went forth to perish, that his band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might still go free? Lo, yonder now he stood!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And none forgot his loving hardihood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The day he put the ghost paint on his face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, dressed for death, went singing to the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Harney’s soldiers waited.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">“Brothers, friends!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow words he spoke. “The longest summer ends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nothing stays forever. We are old.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can anger check the coming of the cold?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When frosts begin men think of meat and wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how to make the days of winter good</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With what the summer leaves them of its cheer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two times I saw the first snow deepen here,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last snow melt; and twice the grass was brown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When I was living at the Soldier’s Town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To save my Brulés. All the while I thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About this alien people I had fought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until a cloud was lifted from my eyes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw how some great spirit makes them wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I saw a white Missouri flowing men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew old times could never be again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This side of where the spirit sheds its load.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then let us give the Powder River road,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For they will take it if we do not give.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not all can die in battle. Some must live.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I think of those and what is best for those.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dakotas, I have spoken.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Cries arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where his band of Brulé warriors sat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cries that once sent Panic up the Platte,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An eyeless runner panting through the gloom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For though their chief had seen the creeping doom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some black cloud that gnaws the prairie rim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet echoes of their charges under him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had soared and sung above the words he said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now silence, like some music of the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That holds a throng of new-born spirits awed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Possessed the brooding crowd. A lone crow cawed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wind fled moaning like a wildered ghost.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So clung that vatic hush upon the host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the Bad Face Ogalala band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw Red Cloud coming forward on the stand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serene with conscious might, a king of men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then all the hills were ululant again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though a horde of foes came charging there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For here was one who never gave despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moral mien, nor schooled a righteous hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To live at peace with evil. Tall and straight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stood and scanned the now quiescent crowd;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then faced the white commissioners and bowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gracious bow⁠—the gesture of a knight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose courage pays due deference to might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the trumpets breathe the battle’s breath.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not now he seemed that fearful lord of death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose swarm of charging warriors, clad in red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were like a desolating thunder-head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against an angry sunset. Many a Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recalled the time he fought alone and slew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His father’s slayers, Bull Bear and his son,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While yet a fameless youth; and many a one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the fort, remembering Grattán</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his troopers slaughtered by a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So bland of look and manner, wondered much.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soft to the ear as velvet to the touch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His speech, that lacked but little to be song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caressed the fringing hushes of the throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where many another’s cry would scarce be clear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“My brothers, when you see this prairie here,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You see my mother. Forty snows and four</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have blown and melted since the son she bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First cried at Platte Forks yonder, weak and blind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whether winter-stern or summer-kind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her ways with me were wise. Her thousand laps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have shielded me. Her ever-giving paps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have suckled me and made me tall for war.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What presents shall I trade my mother for?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A string of beads? A scarlet rag or two?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Already he was going ere they knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he had ceased. Among the people fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sound as when the frosted oaks are red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And naked thickets shiver in the flaws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far out among the lodges keened the squaws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrill with a sorrow women understand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the mother-passion of the land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had found a human voice to claim the child.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>With lifted brows the bland commission smiled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As clever men who share a secret joke.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At length the Brulé, Swift Bear, rose and spoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt fear and favor poised. He seemed a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, doubting both his ponies, rode the span</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And used the quirt with caution. Black Horse then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Harangued the crowd a space, the words, Cheyenne,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their sense, an echo of the White Man’s plea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rebounding from a tense expectancy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many pleasing gifts.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">But all the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These wrestled with the question, mile on mile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The White Man’s answer crept along the road⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two hundred mule-teams, leaning to the load,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seven hundred soldiers! Middle May</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had seen their dust cloud slowly trail away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Kearney. Rising ever with the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And falling when the evening had begun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It drifted westward. When the low-swung moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a cradle for the baby June,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They camped at Julesburg. Yet another week</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the South Platte’s flood to Pumpkin Creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They fought the stubborn road. Beneath the towers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Court House Rock, awash in starry showers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their fagged herd grazed. Past Chimney Rock they crawled;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past where the roadway narrows, dizzy walled;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Mitchell Post. And now, intent to win</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere dusk to where the Laramie comes in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The surly teamsters swore and plied the goad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lurching wagons grumbled at the road,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trace-chains clattered and the spent mules brayed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Protesting as the cracking lashes played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On lathered withers bitten to the red;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, glinting in the slant glare overhead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A big dust beckoned to the Soldier’s Town.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It happened now that Red Cloud, peering down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dazzling valley road with narrowed eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld that picture-writing on the skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knitted puzzled brows to make it out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, weighing this and that, a lonely scout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might read a trail by moonlight. Loudly still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The glib logicians wrangled, as they will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The freer for the prime essential lacked⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A due allowance for the Brutal Fact,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, by the vulgar trick of being so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confounds logicians.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Lapsing in a flow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of speech and counter-speech, a half hour passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While Red Cloud stared and pondered. Then at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men saw him rise and leave his brooding place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flinty look of battle on his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gripping claw of wrath between his brows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Electric in the sullen summer drowse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The silence deepened, waiting for his word;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still he gazed, nor spoke. The people heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The river lipping at a stony brink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rippling flag, then suddenly the clink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bridle-bits, the tinkling sound of spurs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chieftains and the white commissioners</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pressed forward with a buzzing of surprise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people turned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Atop a gentle rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cut the way from fort to ford in half,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came Carrington a-canter with his staff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yonder, miles behind, the reeking air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Revealed how many others followed there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do his will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Now rising to a shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The voice of Red Cloud towered, crushing out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wonder-hum that ran from band to band:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“These white men here have begged our hunting land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their words are crookèd and their tongues are split;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For even while they feign to beg for it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their soldiers come to steal it! Let them try,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prove how good a warrior is a lie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And learn how Ogalalas meet a thief!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You, Spotted Tail, may be the beggar’s chief⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I go to keep my mother-land from harm!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He tapped his rifle nestled in his arm.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“From now I put my trust in this!” he said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lowered voice; then pointing overhead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Great Spirit, too, will help me!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">With a bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He cleared the bower-railing for the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shouting “Bring the horses in,” he made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His way across the turbulent parade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the Ogalala lodges stood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, driving down some hollow in a wood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A great wind shoulders through the tangled ruck</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after it, swirled inward to the suck,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crested timber roars.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Then, like a bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fills a sudden lull, again was heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clink of steel as Carrington rode through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man-walled lane that cleft the crowd in two;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, hobbling after, mindless of the awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That favors might, a toothless, ancient squaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lifted a feeble fist at him and screamed.</span>

						<p epub:type="title">The Council on the Powder</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>Serenely now the ghost of summer dreamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Powder River. ’Twas the brooding time,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With nights of starlight glinting on the rime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That cured the curly grass for winter feed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And days of blue and gold when scarce a reed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might stir along the runnels, lean with drouth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some few belated cranes were going south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And any hour the blizzard wind might bawl;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still the tawny fingers of the Fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay whist upon the maw of Winter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">Thrice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The moon had been a melting boat of ice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the burning breakers of the west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Red Cloud, bitter-hearted, topped the crest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the Fort and took the homeward track,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Bad Face Ogalalas at his back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some few Brulés. Silently he rode,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they who saw him bent as with a load</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the tribal sorrow that should be,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursued the trail as silently as he⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A fateful silence, boding little good.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the mouth of Bitter Cottonwood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They travelled; onward through the winding halls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Platte is darkened; and the listening walls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heard naught of laughter⁠—heard the ponies blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rawhide creak upon the bent travaux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lodge-poles skid and slidder in the sand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor yet beyond amid the meadowland</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was any joy; nor did the children play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite the countless wooers by the way⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wild larkspur, tulip, bindweed, prairie pea.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shadow of a thing that was to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell on them too, though what they could not tell.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Still on, beyond the Horseshoe and La Prele,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They toiled up Sage Creek where the prickly pear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bloomed gaudily about the camp. And there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cheyenne, Black Horse, riding from the south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came dashing up with sugar in his mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To spew on bitter moods. “Come back,” he whined;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Our good white brothers call you, being kind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And having many gifts to give to those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who hear them.” But the braves unstrung their bows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beat him from the village, counting coup,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While angry squaws reviled the traitor too,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And youngsters dogged him, aping what he said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the barren Cheyenne watershed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their ponies panted, where the sage brush roots</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bit deep to live. They saw the Pumpkin Buttes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Dry Fork. Then the Powder led them down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A day past Lodge Pole Creek.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Here Red Cloud’s town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With water near and grass enough, now stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid a valley strewn with scrubby wood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And idling in the lazy autumn air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lodge-smoke rose. The only idler there!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all day long the braves applied their hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To scraping dogwood switches smooth and straight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For battle-arrows; and the teeth that bit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gnarly shaft, put venom into it</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the day the snarling shaft should bite.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unceasingly from morning until night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The squaws toiled that their fighting men might eat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor be less brave because of freezing feet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By hundreds they were stitching rawhide soles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To buckskin uppers. Many drying-poles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Creaked with the recent hunt; and bladders, packed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With suet, fruit and flesh, were being stacked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For hungers whetted by the driving snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fresh robes were tanning in the autumn glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For warriors camping fireless in the cold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And noisily the mimic battles rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the little children, grim in play.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The village had been growing day by day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since Red Cloud sent a pipe to plead his cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the far-flung Tetons. Hunkpapas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unhurried by the fear of any foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were making winter meat along Moreau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The day the summons came to gird their loins.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sans Arcs, roving where the Belle Fourche joins</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Big Cheyenne, had smoked the proffered pipe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When grapes were good and plums were getting ripe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the Niobrara meadowlands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up the White, the scattered Brulé bands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That scorned the talk at Laramie, had heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Black Hills went the pipe and word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find the Minneconjoux killing game</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where elk and deer were plentiful and tame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And clear creeks bellowed from the canyon beds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still westward where the double Cheyenne heads,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hunting Ogalalas hearkened too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So grew the little camp as lakelets do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When coulees grumble to a lowering sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Big names, already like a battle cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were common in the town; and there were some</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In which terrific thunders yet were dumb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But soon should echo fearsome and abhorred:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crow King, Big Foot, the younger Hump, and Sword,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black Leg and Black Shield, Touch-the-Cloud and Gall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that one fear would trumpet over all⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young Crazy Horse; and Spotted Tail, the wise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Red Cloud and Man Afraid, both battle-cries;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rain-in-the-Face, yet dumb; and Sitting Bull.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas council time, for now the moon was full;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The time when, ere the stars may claim the dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A goblin morning with the owl for lark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Steals in; and ere the flags of day are furled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pressed white against the window of the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A scarred face stares astonished at the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The moonset and the sunrise came as one;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ere the daybreak lifted by a span</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The frosty dusk, the teepee tops began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To burgeon, and a faery sapling grove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood tall, to bloom in sudden red and mauve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gold against the horizontal light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still humped, remembering the nipping night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dogs prowled, sniffing, round the open flaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where women carved raw haunches in their laps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To feed the kettles for the council feast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the silence of the lifting east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The criers shouted now⁠—old men and sage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Using the last sad privilege of age</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For brief pathetic triumphs over youth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Neat saws and bits of hortatory truth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They proffered with the orders of the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And names that were as scarlet in the gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pending ill they uttered like a song⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The names of those who, being wise or strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should constitute the council. ’Round and ’round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The focal centers of a spreading sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The criers went. The folk began to fuse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In groups that seized the latest bit of news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sputtered with the tongue of fool and seer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A roaring hailed some chanted name held dear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or in a silence, no less eloquent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some other, tainted with suspicion, went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the people like a wind that blows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In solitary places.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Day arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spear-length high. The chattering became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bated hum; for, conscious of their fame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And clad in gorgeous ceremonial dress,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Fathers of the Council cleft the press</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In lanes that awe ran on before to clear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And expectation closed the flowing rear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sucked in to where the council bower stood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long since the busy squaws had fetched the wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lit the council fire, now smouldering.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The great men entered, formed a broken ring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To open eastward, lest the Light should find</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No entrance, and the leaders of the blind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>See darkly too. With reverential awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people, pressed about the bower, saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fathers sit, and every tongue was stilled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Red Cloud took the sacred pipe and filled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bowl with fragrant bark, and plucked a brand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To light it. Now with slowly lifted hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He held it to the glowing sky, and spoke:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Grandfather, I have filled a pipe to smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And you shall smoke it first. In you we trust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To show good trails.” He held it to the dust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Grandmother, I have filled a pipe for you,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He said, “and you must keep us strong and true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For you are so.” Then offering the stem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To all four winds, he supplicated them</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That they should blow good fortune. Then he smoked;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the Fathers after him invoked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Mysteries that baffle Man’s desire.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some women fetched and set beside the fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steaming kettles, then with groundward gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Withdrew in haste. A man of ancient days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who searched a timeless dusk with rheumy stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw the ghosts of things that struggle there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before men struggle, now remembered Those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With might to help. Six bits of meat he chose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The best the pots afforded him, and these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gave in order to the Mysteries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sky, the Earth, the Winds, as was their due.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Before I eat, I offer this to you,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He chanted as he gave; “so all men should.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I hope that what I eat may do me good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what you eat may help you even so.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I ask you now to make my children grow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To men and women. Keep us healthy still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And give us many buffalo to kill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And plenty grass for animals to eat.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some youths came forth to parcel out the meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In order as the councillors were great</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In deeds of worth; and each, before he ate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Addressed the mystic sources of the good.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The feast now being finished, Red Cloud stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still pondering his words with mouth set grim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But men felt thunder in the hush of him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew what lightning struggled to be wise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind the hawklike brooding of the eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chipped flint look about the cheek and jaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The humming of a hustling autumn flaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In aspen thickets swept the waiting crowd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed his voice would tower harsh and loud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It crooned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i6">“My friends, ’twas many snows ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When first we welcomed white men. Now we know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their hearts are bad and all their words are lies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They brought us shining things that pleased the eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And weapons that were better than we knew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And this seemed very good. They brought us too</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spirit water, strong to wash away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The coward’s fear, and for a moment stay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The creeping of old age and gnawing sorrow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My friends, if you would have these things tomorrow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forget the way our fathers taught us all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though you planned to live till mountains fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seek out all things men need and pile them high.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be fat yourself and let the hungry die;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be warm yourself and let the naked freeze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So shall you see the trail the white man sees.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when your teepee bulges to the peak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look round you for some neighbor who is weak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And take his little too. Dakotas, think!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall all the white man’s trinkets and his drink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By which the mind is overcome and drowned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be better than our homes and hunting ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The guiding wisdom of our old men’s words?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall we be driven as the white man’s herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From grass to bitter grass? When Harney said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His people, seeking for the yellow lead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would like an iron trail across our land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our good old chieftains did not understand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What snake would crawl among us. It would pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across our country; not a blade of grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should wither for that passing, they were told.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now when scarce the council fire is cold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Little Piney hear the beat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of axes and the desecrating feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of soldiers! Are we cowards? Shall we stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unmoved as trees and see our Mother Land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plowed up for corn?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Increasing as he spoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smothered wrath now mastered him, and ’woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sleeping thunder all had waited for.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of a thrilling hush he shouted: “<em>War!</em>”⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cry to make an enemy afraid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grazing ponies pricked their ears and neighed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recalling whirlwind charges; and the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Roared after like a brush-jam breaking down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many waters.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">When the quiet fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another rose with phrases chosen well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To glut the tribal wrath, and took his seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the crowd’s acclaim. Like chunks of meat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung bloody to a pack, raw words were said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By others; and the rabble’s fury, fed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outgrew the eager feeding. Who would dare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rise amid the bloodlust raging there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And offer water?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Spotted Tail stood up;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And since all knew no blood was in the cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That he would give, dumb scorn rejected him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gazed afar, and something seen made dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wonted quizzic humor of the eyes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mouth, once terrible with battle-cries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took on a bitter droop as he began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“<em>Hey⁠—hey’-hey!</em> So laments an aging man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who totters and can never more be free</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As once he was. <em>Hey⁠—hey’-hey!</em> So may we</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exclaim today for what the morrow brings.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There is a time, my brothers, for all things,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And we are getting old. Consider, friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How everything begins and grows and ends</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That other things may have their time and grow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What tribes of deer and elk and buffalo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have we ourselves destroyed lest we should die!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About us now you hear the dead leaves sigh;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since these were green, how few the moons have been!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We share in all this trying to begin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This trying not to die. Consider well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The White Man⁠—what you know and what men tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About his might. His never weary mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And busy hands do magic for his kind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those things he loves we think of little worth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet, behold! he sweeps across the earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what shall stop him? Something that is true</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must help him do the things that he can do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For lies are not so mighty. Be not stirred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By thoughts of vengeance and the burning word!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Such things are for the young; but let us give</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Good counsel for the time we have to live,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seek the better way, as old men should.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He ended; yet a little while he stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abashed and lonely, seeing how his words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had left as little trace as do the birds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the wide insouciance of air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sat at length; and round him crouching there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hostile silence closed, as waters close</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the drowned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Then Sitting Bull arose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through the stirring crowd a murmur ’woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a river yielding to the stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some deft swimmer. No heroic height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proclaimed him peer among the men of might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was his bearing such as makes men serve.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bull-torsed, squat-necked, with legs that kept a curve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fit the many ponies he had backed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He scarcely pleased the eyes. But what he lacked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of visible authority to mould</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men’s lives, was compensated manifold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By something penetrating in his gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That searched the rabble, seeming to appraise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The common weakness that should make him strong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One certainty about him held the throng⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His hatred of the white men. Otherwise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Conjecture, interweaving truth and lies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrought various opinions of the man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mountebank⁠—so one opinion ran⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A battle-shirking intimate of squaws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A trivial contriver of applause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A user of the sacred for the base.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet there was something other in his face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than vanity and craft. And there were those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who aw him in that battle with the Crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The day he did a thing no coward could.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There ran a slough amid a clump of wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From whence, at little intervals, there broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A roaring and a spurt of rifle-smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That left another wound among the Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now Sitting Bull rode down upon the slough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see what might be seen there. What he saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was such as might have gladdened any squaw⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wounded warrior with an empty gun!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas then that deed of Sitting Bull was done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many saw it plainly from the hill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would any coward shun an easy kill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lose a scalp? Yet many saw him throw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His loaded rifle over to the Crow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retreat a space, then wheel to charge anew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With but a riding quirt he counted coup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And carried back a bullet in his thigh.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let those who jeered the story for a lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold him limping yet! And others said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had the gift of talking with the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And used their clearer seeing to foretell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dark things aright; that he could weave a spell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make a foeman feeble if he would.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Such things the people pondered while he stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And searched them with a quiet, broad-browed stare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly some magic happened there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can men grow taller in a breathing span?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He spoke; and even scorners of the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were conscious of a swift, disarming thrill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The impact of a dominating will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That overcame them.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">“Brothers, you have seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way the spring sun makes the prairie green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wakes new life in animal and seed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Preparing plenty for the biggest need,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembering the little hungers too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same mysterious quickening makes new</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men’s hearts, for by that power we also live.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so, till now, we thought it good to give</span>
						<br/>

						<br/>
						<span>We face a greedy people, weak and small</span>

						<span>When first our fathers met them, now grown tall</span>

						<span>And overbearing. Tireless in toil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These madmen think it good to till the soil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And love for endless getting marks them fools.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold, they bind their poor with many rules</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And let their rich go free! They even steal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The poor man’s little for the rich man’s weal!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their feeble have a god their strong may flout!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They cut the land in pieces, fencing out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their neighbors from the mother of all men!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When she is sick, they make her bear again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With medicines they give her with the seed!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All this is sacrilegious! Yet they heed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No word, and like a river in the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They flood the country, sweeping everything</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before them! ’Twas not many snows ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They said that we might hunt our buffalo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this our land forever. Now they come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To break that promise. Shall we cower, dumb?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or shall we say: ‘First kill us⁠—here we stand!’ ”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He paused; then stooping to the mother-land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He scraped a bit of dust and tossed it high.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the hollow everlasting sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All watched it drifting, sifting back again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In utter silence. “So it is with men,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said Sitting Bull, his voice now low and tense;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“What better time, my friends, for going hence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than when we have so many foes to kill?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He ceased. As though they heard him speaking still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people listened; for he had a way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed to mean much more than he could say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over all the village cast a spell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At length some warrior uttered in a yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The common hate. ’Twas like the lean blue flash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That stabs a sultry hush before the crash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of heaven-rending thunder and the loud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assault of winds. Then fury took the crowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And set it howling with the lust to slay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The councillors were heard no more that day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the moony hill tops all night long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wolves gave answer to the battle-song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw their valley hunting-grounds aflare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With roaring fires, and frenzied shadows there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That leaped and sang as wolves do, yet were men.</span>

						<p epub:type="title">Fort Phil Kearney</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>Long since the column, pushing north again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Carrington, had left the little post</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Laramie; unwitting how the ghost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many a trooper, lusty yet and gay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disconsolately drifting back that way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should fill unseen the gaps of shattered ranks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Scarce moved to know what shadows dogged their flanks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till all the winds that blew were talking spies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And draws had ears and every hilltop, eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And silence, tongues, the seven hundred went.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How brazenly their insolent intent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was flaunted! Even wolves might understand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These men were going forth to wed the land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spawn their breed therein. Behold their squaws!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could such defend the Great White Father’s laws?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So weak they were their warriors hewed the wood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did they tend the pots, as women should,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor fill them.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Powder River caught the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of how they swam their long-horned cattle herd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Bridger’s Ferry. Big Horn and the Tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld through nearer eyes the long line flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up Sage Creek valley; heard through distant ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cracking lashes of the muleteers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The day the sandy trail grew steep and bleak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Rosebud saw them crossing Lightning Creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whence, southward, cone outsoaring dizzy cone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the last gleamed splendidly alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They viewed the peak of Laramie. When, high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the head of North Fork and the Dry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They lifted Cloud Peak scintillant with snows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cheyenne hunters and Arapahoes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far-flung as where the Wind becomes the Horn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discussed their progress. Spirits of the morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That watched them break the nightly camp and leave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outwinged the crane to gossip with the eve</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In distant camps. Beyond the Lodge Pole’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Relentless Red Cloud, poring on the south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could see them where the upper Powder ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Reno Post, and counted to a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers left there. Tattlings of the noon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were bruited by the glimmer of the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In lands remote; till, pushing northward yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Crazy Woman’s Fork and Lake DeSmedt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They reached the Big and Little Piney Creeks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some such a land the famished hunter seeks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In fever-dreams of coolness. All day long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snow-born waters hummed a little song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To virgin meadows, till the sun went under;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then tardy freshets in a swoon of thunder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That deepened with the dark, went rushing by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere the Night herself sang lullaby</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till morning. Cottonwoods and evergreens</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made music out of what the silence means</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In timeless solitudes. And over all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White towers dizzy on a floating wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of stainless white, the Big Horn Mountains rose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Absoraka, the Country of the Crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A land men well might fight for!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">Here they camped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rejoicing, man and beast. The work-mule champed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The forage of the elk, and rolled to sate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His lust for greenness. Like a voice of fate,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foretelling ruthless years, his blatant bray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With horns of woe and trumpets of dismay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crowded the hills. The milk cow and the steer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In pastures of the bison and the deer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lowed softly. And the trail-worn troopers went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About their duties, whistling, well content</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share this earthly paradise of game.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But scarcely were the tents up, when there came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was it a sign? One moment it was noon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A golden peace hypnotic with the tune</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bugs among the grasses; and the next,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spacious splendor of the world was vexed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With twilight that estranged familiar things.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moaning sound, as of enormous wings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung wide to bear some swooping bat of death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awakened. Hills and valleys held their breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hear that sound. A nervous troop-horse neighed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrill in the calm. Instinctively afraid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cattle bellowed and forgot to graze;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And raucous mules deplored the idle day’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Untimely end. Then presently there fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What seemed a burlesque blizzard out of hell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A snow of locusts⁠—tawny flakes at strife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That, driven by a gust of rabid life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smothered the windless noon! The lush grass bent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Devoured in bending. Wagon-top and tent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sagged with the drift of brown corrosive snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Innumerable hungers shrilled below;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A humming fog of hungers hid the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until a cool breath, falling from the high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White ramparts, came to cleanse the stricken world.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly the loud rack lifted, swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eastward; and the golden light returned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now day by day the prairie people learned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What wonders happened where the Pineys flowed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many wagons rutted out a road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the pines stood tallest to be slain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What medicine the White Man’s hand and brain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had conjured; how they harnessed up a fog</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sent a round knife screaming through a log</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From end to end; how many adzes hewed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how the desecrated solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld upon a level creek-side knoll</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rise of fitted bole on shaven bole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until a great fort brazened out the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while that builded insolence was done,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far prairies saw the boasting banner flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above it, like a hissing adder’s tongue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To menace every ancientry of good.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Long since and oft the workers in the wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had felt the presence of a foe concealed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drone of mowers in the haying-field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was silenced often by the rifle’s crack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The arrow’s whirr; and often, forging back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lash and oath along the logging road,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scared mule-whacker fought behind his load,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His team a kicking tangle. Oft by night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some hill top wagged a sudden beard of light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Immediately shorn; and dark hills saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To glimmer sentient. Hours of drowsy awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Near dawn had heard the raided cattle bawl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Afraid of alien herdsmen; bugles call</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To horse; the roaring sally; fleeing cries.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And oft by day upon a distant rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some naked rider loomed against the glare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hand at brow to shade a searching stare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then like a dream dissolved in empty sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So men and fate had labored through July</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make a story. August browned the plain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever Fort Phil Kearney grew amain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sweat of toil and blood of petty fights.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>September brought the tingling silver nights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men worked faster, thinking of the snows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, more than storm they dreaded. Friendly Crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had told wild tales. Had they not ridden through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Powder River gathering of Sioux?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo, at one far end the day was young;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Noon saw the other! Up along the Tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big villages were dancing! Everywhere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The buzzing wasp of war was in the air.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>October smouldered goldenly, and gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>November sulked and threatened. Day by day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While yet the greater evils held aloof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers wrought on wall, stockade and roof</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the coming wrath of God and Man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And often where the lonely home-trail ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They gazed with longing eyes; nor did they see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dust cloud of the prayed-for cavalry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ammunition train long overdue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By now they saw their forces cut in two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>First Reno Post upon the Powder, then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fort Smith upon the Big Horn needing men;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And here the center of the brewing storm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would rage.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Official suavities kept warm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wire to Laramie⁠—assurance bland</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of peace now reigning in the prairie land;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Attest the treaty signed! So said the mail;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But those who brought it up the Bozeman Trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two hundred miles, could tell of running fights,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of playing tag with Terror in the nights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hide by day. If peace was anywhere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It favored most the growing graveyard there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the Piney under Pilot Hill.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>December opened ominously still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarce the noon could dull the eager fang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That now the long night whetted. Shod hoofs rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On frozen sod. The tenuated whine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sudden shriek of buzz-saws biting pine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were heard far off unnaturally loud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The six-mule log-teams labored in a cloud;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drivers beat their breasts with aching hands.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As yet the snow held off; but prowling bands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew bolder. Weary night-guards on the walls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were startled broad awake by wolf-like calls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From spots of gloom uncomfortably near;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out across the crystal hemisphere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weird yammerings arose and died away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To dreadful silence. Every sunny day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The looking-glasses glimmered all about.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, clinging to the darker side of doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men took their boots to bed, nor slumbered soon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It happened on the sixth December noon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That from a hill commanding many a mile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lookout, gazing off to Piney Isle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld the log-train crawling up a draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still half way out. With naked eye he saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lazy serpent reeking in the glare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wintry sunlight. Nothing else was there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But empty country under empty skies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly it seemed a blur of flies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose from each adjacent gulch and break</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, swarming inward, swirled about the snake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That strove to coil amid the stinging mass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One moment through the ill-adjusted glass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Vague shadows flitted; then the whirling specks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were ponies with their riders at their necks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swung low. The lurching wagons spurted smoke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The teams were plunging.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Frantic signals woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bugles at the fort, the brawl of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obeying “boots and saddles.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sentry lifts his glass. ’Tis like a dream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So very near the silent figures seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hand might almost touch them. Here they come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hell-bent for blood⁠—distorted mouths made dumb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With distance! One can see the muffled shout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The twang of bow-thongs! Leaping fog blots out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The agitated picture⁠—flattens, spreads.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dull rumblings wake and perish. Tossing heads</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Emerge, and ramrods prickle in the rack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wheel-mule, sprouting feathers at his back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rears like a clumsy bird essaying flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And falls to vicious kicking. Left and right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deflected hundreds wheel about and swing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To charge anew⁠—tempestuous galloping</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On cotton! Empty ponies bolt away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To turn and stare high-headed on the fray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With muted snorting at the deeds men do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But listen how at last a sound breaks through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deathly silence of the scene! Hurrah</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For forty troopers roaring down the draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Fetterman! A cloud of beaten dust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sent skurrying before a thunder-gust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They round the hogback yonder. With a rush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They pierce the limpid curtain of the hush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quiescing in the picture. Hurry, men!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rabid dogs are rushing in again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look! Hurry! No, they break midway! They see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The squadron dashing up. They turn, they flee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that pack of terriers⁠—like rats!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yell, yell, you lucky loggers⁠—wave your hats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thank the Captain that you’ve kept your hair!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look how they scatter to the northward there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dissolving into nothing! Ply the spurs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You fire-eaters! Catch that pack of curs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This side the Peno, or they’ll disappear!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look out! They’re swooping in upon your rear!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherever did they come from? Look! Good God!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The breaks ahead belch ponies, and the sod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On every side sprouts warriors!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">Holy Spoons!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The raw recruits have funked it! Turn, you loons,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You cowards! Can’t you see the Captain’s game</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To face them with a handful? Shame! O shame!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’ll rub him out⁠—turn back⁠—that’s not the way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We did it to the Johnnies many a day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Dixie! Every mother’s baby rides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though it mattered if they saved their hides!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their empty faces gulp the miles ahead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ride on and live to wish that you were dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back yonder where the huddled muskets spit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against a sea!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Now⁠—now you’re in for it!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here comes the Colonel galloping like sin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around the hill! Hurrah⁠—they’re falling in⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Good boys! It’s little wonder that you ran.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’m not ashamed to say to any man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I might have run.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Ah, what a pretty sight!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go on, go on and show ’em that you’re white!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’re breaking now⁠—you’ve got ’em on the run⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’re scattering! Hurrah!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">The fight was done;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No victory to boast about, indeed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just labor. Sweat today, tomorrow, bleed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An incidental difference. And when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The jaded troopers trotted home again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There wasn’t any cheering. Six of those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clung dizzily to bloody saddle-bows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Bingham was the seventh and was dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Bowers, with less hair upon his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than arrows in his vitals, prayed to die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He did that night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Now thirteen days went by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With neither snow nor foe; and all the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The log-trains kept the road to Piney Isle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Soon all the needed timber would be hauled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The work be done. Then, snugly roofed and walled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What need for men to fear? Some came to deem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The former mood of dread a foolish dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew mellow, thinking of the holidays</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With time for laughter and a merry blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On every hearth and nothing much to do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As for the bruited power of the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who doubted it was overdrawn a mite?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At any rate, they wouldn’t stand and fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unless the odds were heavy on their side.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the Colonel hadn’t any pride⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too cautious. Look at Fetterman and Brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who said they’d ride the whole Sioux nation down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With eighty men; and maybe could, by jing!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Both scrappers⁠—not afraid of anything⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pair of eagles hungering for wrens!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And what about a flock of butchered hens</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Peno valley not so long ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But for the Colonel? Bowers ought to know;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go ask him! Thus the less heroic jeered.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These Redskins didn’t run because they feared;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas strategy; they didn’t fight our way.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Again it happened on the nineteenth day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lookout saw the logging-train in grief;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Captain Powell, leading the relief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Returned without a single scratch to show.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The twentieth brought neither snow nor foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The morrow came⁠—a peaceful, scarlet morn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the homesick sun in Capricorn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had found new courage for the homeward track</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, yearning out across the zodiac</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Cancer, brightened with the conjured scene</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of grateful hills and valleys flowing green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sweet incense rising from the rain-soaked sward,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And color-shouts of welcome to the Lord</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Savior.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Ninety took the logging-road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That morning, happy that the final load</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would trundle back that day, and all be well.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But hardly two miles out the foemen fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon them, swarming three to one. And so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more the hilltop lookout signalled woe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made the fort a wasp-nest buzzing ire.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The rip and drawl of running musket fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The muffled, rhythmic uproar of the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made plain to all that what there was to do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out yonder gave but little time to waste.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A band of horse and infantry soon faced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Colonel’s quarters, waiting for the word.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the distant tumult many heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His charge to Powell, leader of the band;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And twice ’twas said that all might understand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The need for caution: “Drive away the foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And free the wagon-train; but do not go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Lodge Trail Ridge.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">A moment’s silence fell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many in the after-time would dwell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon that moment, little heeded then⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ghostly horses and the ghostly men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The white-faced wives, the gaping children’s eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown big with wonder and a dread surmise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see their fathers waiting giant-tall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That mumbling voice of doom beyond the wall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ghastly golden pleasance of the air;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Fetterman, a spectre, striding there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the Colonel, while the portals yawn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As vivid as a picture lightning-drawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the night, that memory would flash,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More vivid for the swooping backward crash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gloom. ’Twas but the hinges of the gates</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shrieked that moment, while the eager Fates</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Told off the waiting band and gloated: <em>Done!</em></span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<em>He asked for eighty⁠—give him eighty-one!</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then Fetterman, unwitting how the rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of endless outer silence pressed on him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his comrades, spoke: “With deference due</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Captain Powell, Colonel, and to you,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I claim command as senior captain here.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So ever is the gipsy Danger dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Courage; so the lusty woo and wed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their dooms, to father in a narrow bed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A song against the prosing after-years.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now the restive horses prick their ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nicker to the bugle. Fours about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They rear and wheel to line. The hillsides shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back to the party. Forward! Now it swings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High-hearted through the gate of common things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where bright hazard, like a stormy moon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still gleams round Hector, Roland, Sigurd, Fionn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the lost, horizon-hungry prows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eternal in contemporary nows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heave seaward yet.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">The Colonel mounts the wall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once again is heard his warning call:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Relieve the wagon-train, but do not go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Lodge Trail Ridge.” And Fetterman, below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turns back a shining face on him, and smiles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the gap that neither years nor miles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May compass now.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">A little farther still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They watched him skirt a westward-lying hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That hid him from the train, to disappear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“He’ll swing about and strike them in the rear,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The watchers said, “and have the logging crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For anvil.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i6">Now a solitary Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was galloping in circles on a height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That looked on both the squadron and the fight⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie sign for “many bison seen.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lucky case-shot swept the summit clean,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And presently the distant firing ceased;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was there sound or sight of man or beast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outside for age-long minutes after that.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At length a logger, spurring up the flat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arrived with words of doubtful cheer to say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Indians had vanished Peno way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The train was moving on to Piney Isle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He had no news of Fetterman.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i16">Meanwhile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where ran the Bozeman Road along the bleak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>North slope of Lodge Trail Ridge to Peno Creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big hopes were burning. Silence waited there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brown land, even as the high blue air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed empty. Yet the troubled crows that flew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Keen-eyed above the sunning valley knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What made the windless slough-grass ripple so,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how a multitude of eyes below</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were peering southward to the road-scarred rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where every covert was alive with eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That scanned the bare horizon to the south.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The white of dawn had seen the Peno’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-swarm with men⁠—Cheyennes, Arapahoes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dakotas. When the pale-faced sun arose⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spectre fleeing from a bath of blood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It saw them like a thunder-fathered flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surge upward through the sounding sloughs and draws⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Afoot and mounted, veterans and squaws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Youths new to war, the lowly and the great⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand-footed, single-hearted hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung fortward. Now their chanted battle-songs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dismayed the hills. Now silent with their wrongs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They strode, the sullen hum of hoofs and feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through valleys where aforetime life was sweet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More terrible than songs or battle cries.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sun had traversed half the morning skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, entering the open flat, they poured</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the roadway crossed the Peno ford</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Below the Ridge. Above them wheeled and pried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The puzzled crows, to learn what thing had died,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What carcass, haply hidden from the ken</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of birds, had lured so large a flock of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus chattering with lust. There, brooding doom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They paused and made the brown December bloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With mockeries of August⁠—demon flowers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lethal, thirsting for the sanguine showers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That soon should soak the unbegetting fields⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trailing bonnets and the pictured shields,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lances nodding in the warwind’s breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And faces brave with paint to outstare Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In some swift hush of battle!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Briefly so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They parleyed. Then the spears began to flow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On either side the Ridge⁠—a double stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of horsemen, winking out as in a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High up among the breaks that flanked the trail.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the tall dry grasses of the vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The footmen disappeared; and all the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was still and empty as a dead man’s face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sees unmoved the wheeling birds of prey.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The anxious moments crawled. Then far away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the hills a muffled tumult grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a blanket being ripped in two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many people shouting underground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valley grasses rippled to the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though it were a gusty wind that passed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Far off a bugle’s singing braved the vast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And perished in a wail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">The tall grass stirred.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The rumor of the distant fight was heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little longer. Suddenly it stopped;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And silence, like a sky-wide blanket, dropped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the landscape empty as the moon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The sun, now scarce a lance-length from the noon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed waiting for whatever might occur.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the far Northwest a purplish blur</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had gathered and was crawling up the sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now presently a nearer bugle cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defied the hush⁠—a scarlet flower of sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sowed the sterile silences around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With futile seed of music.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sound of firing and the cries of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose; but now ’twas just beyond the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, climbing to the azure rim of space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The roadway topped the Ridge and disappeared.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tongueless coverts listened, thousand-eared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heard hoof-thunders rumbling over there.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then suddenly the high blue strip of air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was belching warriors in a wind of cries.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In breakneck rout they tumbled from the skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wheeled round to fling more arrows at a foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fled to where the breast-deep grass below</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swayed wildly.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Now a crow-black stallion ’rose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And looming huge against the blue noon doze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Raced back and forth across the Ridge’s rim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While, shooting from beneath the neck of him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cheyenne Big Nose held the roaring rear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did the snarling musket-balls come near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So mighty was his medicine, they say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now presently the high blue wall of day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spewed cavalry along the Ridge; and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A marvel for the tongues and ears of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amazed the hidden watchers of the height.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For like a thunder-stridden wind of night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rages through a touselled poplar grove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rider of the stallion charged, and drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Straight through the middle of the mounted crowd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men saw his bonnet tossing in a cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of manes and tails; and sabre lightnings played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About it. Then, emerging undismayed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He charged back through and galloped down the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bullets that were impotent to kill</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Spat-pinging</i> all around.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">The firing ceased.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fugitives were half a mile at least</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the Peno ford. There, circling wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bows and lances brandished, they defied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The foe to come and fight with them. By now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The infantry had crossed the Ridge’s brow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It joined the troop a little way below;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then all together, cautiously and slow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came down the hated road. And silence lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On summit, slope and valley, deep as day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And doomful, as they came. The flat could hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The murmur of the straining saddle-gear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shuffling feet, the clinking of the bits;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when a nervous troop-horse neighed by fits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ponies, lurking in the broken lands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That flanked the Ridge, kept silence for the hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gripped their nostrils.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Now the eighty-one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were half way down the hill. The nooning sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slipped fearfully behind a flying veil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the gray northwest a raw-cold gale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came booming up. The fugitive decoys,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off yonder in the flat, like playing boys</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Divided now and waged a mimic fight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Immediately half way up the height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the breaks appeared a warrior’s torse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand hidden eyes knew Little Horse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cheyenne chieftain; saw him wave a spear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Left-handed; pass it round him in the rear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To seize it with the right.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">The whole flat swarmed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With footmen. Mounted warriors thunder-stormed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By hundreds from the breaks above; and one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came dashing down the ridge-road at a run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And plunged among the soldiery to die</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the frantic sabres. With a cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That set the horses wild, the swarm closed in.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The cavalry, as hoping yet to win</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The summit of the Ridge, wheeled round and hewed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A slow way upward through the solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of lances, howling in the arrow-storm.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rest, already circled by the swarm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took cover in a patch of tumbled rock</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, huddled like a blizzard-beaten flock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They faced the swirling death they could not stem.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little while before it smothered them</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dwindling few toiled mightily, men say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gun-butts swinging in the dim melee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of battle-clubs and lances; then were still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The wave broke over, surging up the hill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For yonder yet the battle smoked and roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, midway ’twixt the summit and the ford,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little band of troopers held the height⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Green manhood withering in a locust flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of arrows! Aye, a gloaming of despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shuttling arrows wove above them there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So many were the bows. Cheyenne and Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went down beneath the shafts their brothers drew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arapahoes struck down Arapahoes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwittingly. And many a red gout froze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the slopes, so keen had grown the gale.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A little while those makers of a tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave battle like a badger in a hole;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor could the ponies charge the narrow knoll,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For either slope was steep and gully-scrawled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still up and up the cautious bowmen crawled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the troopers overawed the field.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then presently, men say, a white chief reeled;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rolled from his saddle; like a man gone daft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Got up and doddered, tugging at a shaft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sprouted from his belly. Then a yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many bowmen mocked him as he fell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His writhing body feathered like a goose.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The troops began to turn their horses loose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retreating up the ridge, a hopeless crowd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lull of battle thinned the arrow-cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above them; for the mounted warriors knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers doomed whatever they might do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fell to rounding up the runaways.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile the broken troopers in a daze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of desperation scrambled up the slope.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strewn boulders yonder woke a lying hope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there they waited, living, in their grave.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The horse-chase ended. Once again the wave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to mount the steep on either side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While warriors hailed their fellows and replied:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<em>Be ready!⁠—We are ready, brothers!</em>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">Then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hillsides bellowed with a surf of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung crowding on the boulders. ’Twas the end.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some trooper’s wolfhound, mourning for his friend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loped fortward, pausing now and then to cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His urgent question to the hostile sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That spat a stinging frost. And someone said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Let yonder dog bear tidings of the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the white men tremble over there.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“No, teach them that we do not even spare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their dogs!” another said. An arrow sang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrill to the mark. The wolfhound yelped and sprang,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snapped at the feather, wilted, and was still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so they perished on that barren hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the Peno. And the Winter strode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Numb-footed down that bloody stretch of road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At twilight, when a squadron came to read</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The corpse-writ rune of battle, deed by deed,</span>

						<span>Between the Ridge’s summit and the ford.</span>

						<span>The blizzard broke at dusk. All night it roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Round Fort Phil Kearney mourning for the slain.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Besieging January made the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One vast white camp to reinforce the foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That watched the fort. Mad cavalries of snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assaulted; stubborn infantries of cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat round the walls and waited. Wolves grew bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To peer by night across the high stockade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, builded for the Winter’s escalade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hard drifts leaned. And often in the deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of night men started from a troubled sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To think the guards were fighting on the wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, roaring over like a waterfall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wild hordes pouring in upon the lost.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ’twas the timber popping in the frost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mourning wolves. Nor did the dawn bring cheer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Becandled like a corpse upon a bier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lifeless sun, from gloom to early gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stole past⁠—a white procession to a tomb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Illumining the general despair.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Meanwhile Omniscience in a swivel chair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unmenaced half a continent away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid more pressing matters of the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had edited the saga of the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Compare the treaty where it plainly said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was no war! All duly signed and sealed!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Undoubtedly the evidence revealed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The need of an official reprimand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore stern orders ticked across the land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Washington to Laramie. Perhaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No blizzard swept the neat official maps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To nip a tracing finger. Howsoe’er,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Four companies of horse and foot must bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Fort Phil Kearney tidings of its shame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through ten score miles of frozen hell they came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Frost-bitten, wolfish⁠—with the iron word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Carrington dishonored and transferred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Reno Post. The morning that he went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun was like a sick man in a tent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crouched shivering between two feeble fires.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far off men heard his griding wagon tires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shriek fife-like in the unofficial snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His floundering three-span mule-teams blaring woe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the blue-cold waste; and he was gone.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Without a thaw the bitter spell wore on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To raging February. Days on days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men could not see beyond the whirling haze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made the fort’s the world’s wall fronting sheer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On chaos. When at times the sky would clear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like a frozen bubble were the nights,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pale rainbows jigged across the polar heights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leafy rustlings mocked the solitude.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men sickened with the stale and salty food,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For squadrons hunt at best with ill success;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And quiet days revealed the wilderness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alert with fires, so doggedly the foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Guarded the deer and elk and buffalo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That roamed the foothills where the grass was good.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A battle often bought a load of wood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And arrows swept the opening water-gate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where the wily bowmen lurked in wait</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the brush-clad Piney.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">March went past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lion, crouched or raging, to the last;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And it was April⁠—in the almanac.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No maiden with the southwind at her back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran crocus-footed up the Bozeman Road.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A loveless vixen swept her drear abode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brooms of whimsic wrath, and scolded shrill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men pined to think of how the whippoorwill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Broidered the moony silences at home.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There now a mist-like green began to roam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The naked forest hillward from the draws;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dogwood’s bloom was vying with the haw’s;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The redbud made a bonfire of its boughs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there, perchance, one lying in a drowse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At midnight heard the friendly thunder crash,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The violet-begetting downpour lash</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flaring panes; and possibly one heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sudden rapture of a mocking bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defy the lightning in a pitch-black lull.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Here dull days wore the teeth of Winter dull.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drifts withered slowly. Of an afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gulches grumbled hoarsely, ceasing soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When sunset faded out. The pasque flower broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The softened sod, and in a furry cloak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And airy bonnet brazened out the chill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long grave yonder under Pilot Hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where eighty lay, was like a wound unwrapped.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cottonwoods, awaking sluggish-sapped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prepared for spring with wavering belief.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May stole along the Piney like a thief.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And yet, another sun made summer now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In wild hearts given glebe-like to the plow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of triumph. So miraculously fed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With slaughter, richly seeded with the dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The many-fielded harvest throve as one.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And Red Cloud was the summer and the sun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>In many a camp, in three great tribal tongues,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That magic name was thunder in the lungs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of warriors. Swift, apocalyptic light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It smote the zenith of the Red Man’s night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With dazzling vision. Forts dissolved in smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hated roadway lifted, drifted, broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was a dust; the white men were a tale;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The green, clean prairie bellowed, hill and vale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fatted bison; and the good old days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came rushing back in one resistless blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of morning!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">It was good to be a youth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That season when all dreaming was the truth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And miracle familiar! Waning May</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could hear the young men singing on the way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Red Cloud. Pious sons and rakehell scamps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unbroken colts, the scandals of their camps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And big-eyed dreamers never tried by strife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One-hearted with the same wild surge of life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sang merrily of dying as they came.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloof amid his solitude of fame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The battle-brooding chieftain heard, to dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of great hordes raging like a flooded stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Powder River to the Greasy Grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never after might a wagon pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along that hated highway of deceit.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The meadows of Absoraka grew sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With nursing June. War-ponies, winter-thin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nuzzled the dugs of ancient might therein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the day of victory. July</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Poured virile ardor from a ruthless sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make stern forage⁠—that the hardened herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might speed as arrows, wheel and veer as birds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have smashing force and never lack for breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be fit for bearing heroes to their death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In that great day now drawing near.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">Meanwhile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more the solitude of Piney Isle</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was startled with a brawl of mules and men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The LongKnives’ wagons clattered there again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The axes bit and rang, saws whined and gnawed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mountain valleys wakened to applaud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mighty in their downfall, meanly slain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now close to Piney Isle there lay a plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some three long bow-shots wide. Good grazing land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was, and empty as a beggar’s hand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Low foothills squatted round with bended knees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And standing mountains waited back of these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To witness what the hunkered hills might view.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw a broad arena roofed with blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That first of August. Where the mid-plain raised</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little knoll, the yellow swelter blazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On fourteen wagon-beds set oval-wise⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A small corral to hold the camp supplies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flour, salt, beans, ammunition, grain in sacks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Therein, forestalling sudden night attacks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mules were tethered when the gloaming starred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The laggard evening. Soldiers, sent to guard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The logging crew, had pitched their tents around.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all of this was like a feeble sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lost in the golden fanfare of the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the Piney Fork, a mile away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unseen among the pines, the work-camp stood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trundling thence with loads of winter wood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stript wagon-trucks creaked fortward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i20">Twilight awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the pines now silenced axe and saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With jingling traces, eager for their grain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the creek and up the gloaming plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The work mules came, hee-hawing at the glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fires among the tents. The day burned low</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To moonless dusk. The squat hills seemed to lift,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Expectant. Peaks on shadow-seas adrift,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went voyaging where lonely wraiths of cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Haunted the starry hushes. Bugs grew loud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the grasses; cynic owls laughed shrill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men slept. But all night long the wolves were still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aware of watchers in the outer dark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now and then a sentry’s dog would bark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rush snarling where it seemed that nothing stirred.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But those who listened for a war-cry, heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The skirling bugs, the jeering owls, the deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discordant snoring of the men asleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon their guns, mules blowing in the hay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At last the blanching summits saw the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A drowsy drummer spread the news of morn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mules began to nicker for their corn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wrangle with a laying back of ears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among them went the surly muleteers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dispensing feed and sulphurous remarks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The harness rattled, and the meadow larks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set dawn to melody. A sergeant cried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The names of heroes. Common men replied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sing-songing down the line. The squat hills heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To seize and gossip with the running word⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span><em>Here! Here! Here!</em> Coffee steaming in the pot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Woodsmoke and slabs of bacon, sizzling hot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were very good to smell. The cook cried “chuck!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the yellow flood of sunrise struck</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little prairie camp, it fell on men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who ate as though they might not eat again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some wouldn’t, for the day of wrath arose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet, but for a cruising flock of crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The basking world seemed empty.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">Now the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was two hours high. The axes had begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the Piney yonder. Drowsy draws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snored with the lagging echoes of the saws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The day swooned windless, indolently meek.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It happened that the pickets by the creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were shaken from a doze by rhythmic cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drumming hoofs. Against the western skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already well within a half a mile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came seven Indians riding single file,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their wiry ponies flattened to the quirt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sentry’s Springfield roared, and hills, alert</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With echoes, fired a ghostly enfillade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ball fell short, bit dust and ricocheted.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The foremost pony, smitten in the breast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went down amid the rearing of the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And floundered to a dusty somersault.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unhurt, the tumbled brave emerged to vault</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind a comrade; and the seven veered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To southward, circling round the spot they feared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where three far-stinging human hornets stood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now one of these went running to the wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see what made the logging camp so still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Short breath sufficed to tell the tale of ill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He brought⁠—the whole crew making off in stealth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And going to the mountains for their health,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mules stampeded!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Things were looking blue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With shaking knees, uncertain what to do,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pickets waited. Whisperings of death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Woke round them, and they felt the gusty breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of shafts that plunked and quivered in the sod.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though men sprouted where the ponies trod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The circling band now jeered them, ten to one.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They scanned the main camp swinking in the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No signal to return! But all the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were rushing round there, staring now and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the foothills, northward, broke the flat.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A pointing sentry shouted: “Look at that!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Good God! There must be thousands over there!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Massed black against the dazzle of the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They made the hilltops crawlingly alive⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The viscid boiling over of a hive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That feels the pale green burning of the spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow-moving, with a phasic murmuring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a giant swarm gone honey-wild,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They took the slope; and still the black rear piled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wriggling ridges. What could bar the way?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dwarfed in the panorama of the day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The camp was but a speck upon the plain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And three remembered eighty lying slain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside a ford, and how the Winter strode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Numb-footed down a bloody stretch of road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across strange faces lately known and dear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“I guess we’d better hustle out of here,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sergeant said. To left, to right, in front,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like starving kiotes singing to the hunt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet overcautious for a close attack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scores pressed the fighting trio, falling back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the Piney campward. One would pause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hold the rear against the arrow-flaws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pelting terror, while the two ran past;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then once again the first would be the last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The second, first. And still the shuttling hoofs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wove closelier with gaudy warps and woofs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The net of death; for still from brush and break</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Piney, like a pregnant water snake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spewed venomous broods.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">So fleeing up the slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pickets battled for the bitter hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dying with their friends. And there was one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who left the wagon boxes at a run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, dashing past the now exhausted three,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knelt down to rest his rifle on his knee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And coolly started perforating hides.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bare ponies, dragging warriors at their sides</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kicking at the unfamiliar weight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Approved his aim. The weaving net of hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went loose, swung wide to southward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i20">So at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They reached the camp where, silent and aghast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The men stood round and stared with haunted eyes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis said a man sees much before he dies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were these not dying? O the eighty-one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bestrewn down Lodge Trail Ridge to Peno Run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That blizzard evening! Here were thirty-two!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no one broached what everybody knew⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tale there’d be and maybe none to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But glutted crows and kiotes. Such a spell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As fastens on a sick room gripped the crowd⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When tick by tick the doctor’s watch is loud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hours between. And like the sound of leaves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through which a night-wind ominously grieves,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The murmur of that moving mass of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To northward rose and fell and rose again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More drowsing music than a waking noise.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And Captain Powell spoke: “Get ready, boys;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Take places; see their eyes, then shoot to kill.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some crouched behind the boxes, staring still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like men enchanted. Others, seeming fain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To feel more keenly all that might remain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ebbing life, paced nervously about.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One fortified the better side of doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With yokes of oxen. That was Tommy Doyle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Alas, the total profit of his toil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would be a hot slug crunching through his skull!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Littman yonder, grunting in the lull,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arranged a keg of salt to fight behind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While Condon, having other things in mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than dying, wrestled with a barrel of beans.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And others planned escape by grimmer means.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old Robertson, with nothing in his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unlaced a boot and noosed the leather lace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reach between a trigger and a toe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He did not tell, and no one asked to know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The meaning of it. Everybody knew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>John Grady and McQuarie did it too,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Haggirty and Gibson did the same,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many others. When the finish came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At least there’d be no torturing for them.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now as a hail-cloud, fraying at the hem,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hurls ragged feelers to the windless void,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nearing mass broke vanward and deployed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To left and right⁠—a dizzy, flying blear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reek of a hell-pot boiling in the rear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now, as when the menaced world goes strange</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cyclone sling-shots, feeling out the range,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spatter the waiting land agape with drouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The few first arrows fell. Once more the south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was humming with a wind of mounted men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That wove the broken net of death again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the creek and up the campward rise.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then suddenly, with wolfish battle-cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And death-songs like the onset of a gale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And arrows pelting like a burst of hail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The living tempest broke. There was no plain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just headgear bobbing in a toss of mane,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horses, horses, horses plunging under.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Paunch-deep in dust and thousand-footed thunder,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That vertigo of terror swarmed and swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the one still spot in all the world⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hushed cyclonic heart. Then that was loud!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The boxes bellowed, and a spurting cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made twilight where the flimsy fortress stood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flying splinters from the smitten wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And criss-cross arrows pricked the drifting haze.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not now, as in the recent musket days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The foe might brave two volleys for a rush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the soldiers, helpless in a hush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of loading. Lo, like rifles in a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The breech-fed Springfields poured a steady stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That withered men and horses roaring in!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gut-shot ponies screamed above the din;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a wounded warrior, under-trod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But silent, wallowed on the bloody sod⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Man piled on man and horses on the men!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They broke and scattered. Would they come again?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abruptly so the muted hail-storm leaves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Astonished silence, when the dripping eaves</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Count seconds for the havoc yet to come.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weird in the hush, a melancholy hum,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where the watching women of the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thronged black along the circling summits, grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fell and grew⁠—the mourning for the dead.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One whispered hoarsely from a wagon-bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Is anybody hit?” But none replied.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awe-struck at what they did and hollow-eyed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All watched and waited for the end of things.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then even as the fleeing hail-cloud swings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before some freakish veering of the gale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Returning down its desolated trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With doubled wrath, the howling horsemen came.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Right down upon the ring of spurting flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The quirted ponies thundered; reared, afraid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that bad medicine the white men made,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, screaming, bolted off with flattened ears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So close the bolder pressed, that clubs and spears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were hurled against the ring.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Again they broke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To come again. Now flashing through the smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like lightning to the battle’s thunder-shocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ignited arrows, streaming to the nocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell hissing where the fighting soldiers lay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flame went leaping through the scattered hay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set the dry mule-litter smouldering.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Half suffocated, coughing with the sting</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of acrid air, like scythemen in a field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers mowed. And gaudy man-flower reeled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wriggling swaths. And still the mad Sioux fought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To break this magic that the white men wrought⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heroic flesh at grapple with a god.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then noon was glaring on the bloody sod;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And broken clouds of horsemen down the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went scudding; hundreds, heavy with the slain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wounded, lagging in the panic rout.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Again the ridges murmured round about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where wailed the wives and mothers of the Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some soldier whispered, asking for a chew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though he feared dread sleepers might arise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young Tommy Doyle with blood upon his eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gaped noonward and his fighting jaw sagged loose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hank Haggirty would never need a noose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To reach between a trigger and a toe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jenness would never hear a bugle blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again, so well he slept. Around the ring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men passed the grisly gossip, whispering⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though doomed flesh were putting on the ghost.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A sound grew up as of a moving host.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed to issue from a deep ravine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To westward. There no enemy was seen.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A freak gust, gotten of a sultry hush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May mumble thus among the distant brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some moments ere a dampened finger cools.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still the smudgy litter of the mules</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plumed straight against the dazzle of the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a hilltop half a mile away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eastward. Red Cloud presently appeared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among his chieftains, gazing where the weird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Susurrus swelled and deepened in the west;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And to and from him dashed along the crest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fleet heralds of some new-begotten hope.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Once more the Piney spread along the slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dizzy ruck of charging horse. They broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before those stingers in a nest of smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled back across the creek, and waited there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i6">The voice of it was everywhere⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bruit of waters fretting at a weir.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The woman-peopled summits hushed to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That marching sound.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Then suddenly a roar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from the bursting open of a door,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swept out across the plain; and hundreds, pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By hundreds crowding yonder from the west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Afoot and naked, issued like a wedge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Red Cloud’s nephew for the splitting edge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tribe’s hot heart behind him for a maul.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Slow, ponderously slow, the V-shaped wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bore down upon the camp. The whirlwind pace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of horsemen seemed less terrible to face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than such a leisure. Brave men held their breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that garish masquerade of Death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aflaunt with scarlets, yellows, blues and greens.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then Condon there behind his barrel of beans,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foreseeing doom, afraid to be afraid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sprang up and waved his rifle and essayed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Homeric speech according to his lights.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Come on!” he yelled, “ye dairty blatherskites,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye blitherin’ ijuts! We kin lick yez all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye low-down naygurs!” Shafts began to fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About him raging. Scattered muskets roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the fraying fringes of the horde.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Get down there, Jim!” men shouted. “Down!” But Jim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Told Death, the blackguard, what he thought of him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For once and all.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Again the Springfields crashed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where the heavy bullets raked and smashed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The solid front and bored the jostling mass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men withered down like flame-struck prairie grass;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But still the raging hundreds forged ahead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pell mell across their wounded and their dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like tumblebugs. The splitting edge went blunt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A momentary eddy at the front</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sucked down the stricken chief. The heavy rear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With rage more mighty than the vanward fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thrust forward. Twenty paces more, and then⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twould be like drowning in a flood of men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already through the rifts one saw their eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Teeth flashing in the yawn of battle-cries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sweat-sleek muscles straining at the bows.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Forgotten were the nooses for the toes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tomorrows died and yesterdays were naught.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sleep-walkers in a foggy nowhere fought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With shadows. So forever from the first,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forever so until this dream should burst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its thin-blown bubble of a world. And then,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shadows were a howling mass of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hurled, heavy with their losses, down the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that thunder-spew of death and pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That followed till the last had disappeared.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hush appalled; and when the smoke had cleared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men eyed each other with a sense of shock</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At being still alive.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">’Twas one o’clock!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One spoke of water. Impishly the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went round the oval, mocking those who heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The riddled barrel had bled from every stave;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what the sun-stewed coffee-kettles gave</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Seemed scarcely wet.</span>
							<span>Off yonder on the hill</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among his chieftains Red Cloud waited still⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tomcat lusting for a nest of mice.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How often could these twenty-nine suffice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To check his thousands? Someone raised a sight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cursed, and fell to potting at the height;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then others. Red Cloud faded into air.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What fatal mischief was he brewing there?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What ailed the Fort? It seemed beyond belief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Wessels yonder wouldn’t send relief!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hush bred morbid fancies. Battle-cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were better than this buzzing of the flies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About Jenness and Haggirty and Doyle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wounds ached and smarted. Shaken films of oil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Troubled the yellow dazzle of the grass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bended heavens were a burning glass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Malevolently focused. Minutes crawled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men gnawed their hearts in silence where they sprawled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each in the puddle of his own blue shade.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But hear! Was that a howitzer that bayed?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look! Yonder from behind the eastward steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Excited warriors, like a flock of sheep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That hear the wolves, throng down the creekward slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flee along the Piney!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Slow to hope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men searched each other’s faces, silent still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A case-shot, bursting yonder on the hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sent dogging echoes up the foe-choked draws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And far hills heard the leather-lunged hurrahs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And answered, when the long blue skirmish line</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swept down the hill to join the twenty-nine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Knee-deep in standing arrows.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i16">Summer turned.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where blackbirds chattered and the scrub oaks burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In meadows of the Milk and Musselshell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fatted bison sniffed the winter-smell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the whetted stars, and drifted south.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the Yellowstone, lean-ribbed with drouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The living rivers bellowed, morn to morn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Powder and the Rosebud and the Horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flowed backward freshets, roaring to their heads.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now up across the Cheyenne watersheds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The manless cattle wrangled day and night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Niobrara and the White</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Uncounted thirsts were slaked. The peace that broods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aloof among the sandhill solitudes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled from the bawling bulls and lowing cows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the triple Loup they paused to browse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left the lush sloughs bare. Along the Platte</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troubled myriads pawed the sandy flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And snorted at the evil men had done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there, from morning sun to evening sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A strange trail cleft the ancient bison world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many-footed monsters whirred and whirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon it; many-eyed they blinked, and screamed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tempestuous with speed, the long mane streamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind them; and the breath of them was loud⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A rainless cloud with lightning in the cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And alien thunder.</span>
							<span>Thus the driving breed,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bold earth-takers, toiled to make the deed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Audacious as the dream. One season saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steel trail crawl away from Omaha</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As far as ox-rigs waddled in a day⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An inchworm bound for San Francisco Bay!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The next beheld a brawling, sweating host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of men and mules build on to Kearney Post</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While spring greens mellowed into winter browns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prairie dogs were giving up their towns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To roaring cities. Where the Platte divides,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The metal serpent sped, with league-long strides,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between two winters. North Platte City sprang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From sage brush where the prairie sirens sang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of magic bargains in the marts of lust;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A younger Julesburg sprouted from the dust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To howl a season at the panting trains;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cheyenne, begotten of the ravished plains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All-hailed the planet as the steel clanged by.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now in frosty vacancies of sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rail-head waited spring on Sherman Hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, brooding further prodigies of will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Blinked off at China.</span>
							<span>So the man-stream flowed</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Full flood beyond the Powder River road⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cow path, hardly worth the fighting for.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then let grass grow upon the trails of war,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bad hearts be good and all suspicion cease!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the Laramie the pipe of peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaited; let the chieftains come and smoke!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas summer when the Great White Father spoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand miles of dying summer heard;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nights were frosty when the crane-winged word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found Red Cloud on the Powder loath to yield.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crop from that rich seeding of the field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Piney flourished greenly still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wail of many women on a hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was louder than the word. And once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw that blizzard of his fighting men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Avail as snow against the August heat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Go tell them I am making winter meat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No time for talk,” he said; and that was all.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The Northwind snuffed the torches of the fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drearily the frozen moons dragged past.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then when the pasque-flower dared to bloom at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And resurrected waters hailed the geese,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It happened that the flying word of peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came north again. The music that it made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was sweet to Spotted Tail, and Man Afraid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave ear, bewitched. One Horn and Little Chief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Believed; and Two Bears ventured on belief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And others who were powers in the land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For here was something plain to understand:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As long as grass should grow and water flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between Missouri River and the snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never melts upon the Big Horn heights,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The country would be closed to all the Whites.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So ran the song that lured the mighty south.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It left a bitter taste in Red Cloud’s mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No music in his ears. “Go back and say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That they can take their soldier-towns away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Piney Fork and Crazy Woman’s Creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Greasy Grass. Then maybe I will speak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great Spirit gave me all this country here.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They have no land to give.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">The hills went sere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Powder; and the summer grew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>June knew not what the white men meant to do;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did July. The end of August came.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bullberries quickened into jets of flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where smoky bushes smouldered by the creeks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grapes purpled and the plums got rosy cheeks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nights were like a watching mother, yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A chill as of incipient regret</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foretold the winter when the twilight fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas then a story wonderful to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went forth at last. In every wind it blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till all the far-flung bison hunters knew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Red Cloud’s name and glory filled the tale.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldier-towns along the hated trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were smoke, and all the wagons and the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were dust blown south! Old times had come again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unscared, the fatted elk and deer would roam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their pastures now, the bison know their home</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flourish there forever unafraid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So when the victor’s winter-meat was made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his lodges ready for the cold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He listened to the word, now twelve moons old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rode south and made his sign and had his will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Meanwhile the road along the Smoky Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was troubled. Hunters, drifting with the herd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fall before, had scattered wide the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Red Cloud’s victory. “Look north,” they said;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The white men made a road there. It is red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With their own blood, and now they whine for peace!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brave tale travelled southward with the geese,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor dwindled on the way, nor lacked applause.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Comanches, South Cheyennes and Kiowas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Apaches and the South Arapahoes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were glad to hear. Satanta, Roman Nose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black Kettle, Little Raven heard⁠—and thought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around their winter fires the warriors fought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those far-famed battles of the North again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their hearts grew strong. “We, too,” they said, “are men;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what men did up yonder, we can do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make red the road along the Smoky too,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And grass shall cover it!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">So when the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was fetlock-deep, wild news ran shuddering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through Kansas: women captured, homes ablaze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men slaughtered in the country north of Hays</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Harker! Terror stalking Denver way!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trains burned along the road to Santa Fe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drivers scalped and given to the flames!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All summer Panic babbled demon names.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No gloom but harbored Roman Nose, the Bat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Satanta, like an omnipresent cat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moused every heart. Out yonder, over there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black Kettle, Turkey Leg were everywhere.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Little Raven was the night owl’s croon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The watch-dog’s bark. The setting of the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was Little Rock; the dew before the dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sweat of horror!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">All that summer, drawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By vague reports and captive women’s wails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cavalry pursued dissolving trails⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And found the hotwind. Loath to risk a fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fleas in the day and tigers in the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wild bands struck and fled to strike anew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drop the curtain of the empty blue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind them, passing like the wrath of God.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The failing year had lit the goldenrod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the tingling nights, now well begun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sunflowers strove to hoard the paling sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For winter cheer; and leagues of prairie glowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With summer’s dying flare, when fifty rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Wallace northward, trailing Roman Nose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mad Cheyenne. A motley band were those⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scouts, hunters, captains, colonels, brigadiers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wild lads who found adventure in arrears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men of beard whom Danger’s lure made young⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drift and wreckage of the great war, flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the brawling border. Two and two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The victor and the vanquished, gray and blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rode out across the Kansas plains together,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hearts singing to the croon of saddle leather</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And jingling spurs. The buffalo, at graze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like dairy cattle, hardly deigned to raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their shaggy heads and watch the horsemen pass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like bursting case-shot, clumps of bluejoint grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exploded round them, hurtling grouse and quail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And plover. Wild hens drummed along the trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At twilight; and the antelope and deer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moved more by curiosity than fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went trotting off to pause and gaze their fill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Short Nose and the Beaver, jogging still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They followed hot upon a trail that shrank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At every tangent draw. Their horses drank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The autumn-lean Republican and crossed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there at last the dwindled trail was lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where sandhills smoked against a windy sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Perplexed and grumbling, disinclined to try</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The upper reaches of the stream, they pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind Forsyth, their leader, pricking west</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Beecher there beside him in the van.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They might have disobeyed a lesser man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what availed another wild goose chase,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foredoomed to end some God-forsaken place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With twilight dying on the prairie rim?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Fame had blown a trumpet over him;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men recalled that Shenandoah ride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Sheridan, the stemming of the tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rabble armies wrecked at Cedar Creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When thirty thousand hearts, no longer weak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were made one victor’s heart.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">And so the band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pushed westward up the lonely river land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Four saddle days from Wallace. Then at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They came to where another band had passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With shoeless ponies, following the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some miles the new trail ran as lean creeks run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In droughty weather; then began to grow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here other hoofs had swelled it, there, travaux;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more and more the circumjacent plains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fed the trail, as when torrential rains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make prodigal the gullies and the sloughs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prairie streams, late shrunken to an ooze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Appal stout swimmers. Scarcity of game</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(But yesterday both plentiful and tame)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And recent pony-droppings told a tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of close pursuit. All day they kept the trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And slept upon it in their boots that night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saddled when the first gray wash of light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was on the hill tops. Past the North Fork’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It led, and, crossing over to the south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Struck up the valley of the Rickaree⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So broad by now that twenty, knee to knee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might ride thereon, nor would a single calk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bite living sod.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Proceeding at a walk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troopers followed, awed by what they dared.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the low hills stood aloof, nor cared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disowning them; that all the gullies mocked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The jingling gear of Folly where it walked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The road to Folly’s end. The low day changed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To evening. Did the prairie stare estranged,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The knowing sun make haste to be away?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw the fingers of the failing day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grow longer, groping for the homeward trail.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw the sun put on a bloody veil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And disappear. A flock of crows hurrahed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Dismounting in the eerie valley, awed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With purple twilight and the evening star,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They camped beside the stream. A gravel bar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here split the shank-deep Rickaree in two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And made a little island. Tall grass grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among its scattered alders, and there stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A solitary sapling cottonwood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within the lower angle of the sand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No jesting cheered the saddle-weary band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That night; no fires were kindled to invoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tales grim with cannon flare and battle smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembered, and the glint of slant steel rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up roaring steeps. They ate short rations cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thought about tomorrow and were dumb.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A hint of morning had begun to come;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So faint as yet that half the stars at least</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discredited the gossip of the east.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grazing horses, blowing at the frost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were shadows, and the ghostly sentries tossed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their arms about them, drowsy in the chill.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Was something moving yonder on the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To westward? It was there⁠—it wasn’t there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps some wolfish reveller, aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dawn, was making home. ’Twas there again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the bubble world of snoring men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was shattered, and a dizzy wind, that hurled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the swooning ruins of the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disintegrating dreams, became a shout:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Turn out! Turn out! The Indians! Turn out!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hearts pounding with the momentary funk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cold blood spurred to frenzy, reeling drunk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sleep, men stumbled up and saw the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where shadows of a dream were blowing still⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No⁠—mounted men were howling down the slopes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horses, straining at their picket ropes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reared snorting. Barking carbines flashed and gloomed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smearing the giddy picture. War drums boomed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shaken rawhide crackled through the din.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A horse that trailed a bounding picket pin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made off in terror. Others broke and fled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly the silence of the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fallen, and the slope in front was bare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And morning had become a startled stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the empty prairie, white with frost.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Five horses and a pair of pack mules lost!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That left five donkeys for the packs. Men poked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sly banter at the mountless ones, invoked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The “infantry” to back them, while they threw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The saddles on and, boot to belly, drew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Groan-fetching cinches tight.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">A scarlet streak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was growing in the east. Amid the reek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cowchip fires that sizzled with the damp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smell of coffee spread about the camp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mood of peace. But ’twas a lying mood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For suddenly the morning solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was solitude no longer. “Look!” one cried.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The resurrection dawn, as prophesied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lacked nothing but the trump to be fulfilled!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wriggled from the valley grass! They spilled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the sky rim! North and south and west</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Increasing hundreds, men and ponies, pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the few.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">’Twas certain death to flee.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way left open down the Rickaree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the valley narrowed to a gap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was plainly but the baiting of a trap.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who rode that way would not be riding far.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Keep cool now, men! Cross over to the bar!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The colonel shouted. Down they went pell-mell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Churning the creek. A heaven-filling yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assailed them. Was it triumph? Was it rage?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some few wild minutes lengthened to an age</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While fumbling fingers stripped the horses’ backs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tied the horses. Crouched behind the packs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saddles now, they fell with clawing hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To digging out and heaping up the sands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around their bodies. Shots began to fall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The first few spatters of a thunder squall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the Colonel strolled about the field,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Encouraging the men. A pack mule squealed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And floundered. “Down!” men shouted. “Take it cool,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Colonel answered; “we can eat a mule</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When this day’s work is over. Wait the word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then see that every cartridge wings a bird.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Don’t shoot too fast.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">The dizzy prairie spun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With painted ponies, weaving on the run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A many colored noose. So dances Death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bedizened like a harlot, when the breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Autumn flutes among the shedding boughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarlets caper and the golds carouse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bronzes trip it and the late green leaps.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then, as when the howling winter heaps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The strippings of the hickory and oak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hurls them in a haze of blizzard smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along an open draw, the warriors formed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eastward down the Rickaree, and stormed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the isle, their solid front astride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shallow water.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">“Wait!” the Colonel cried;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Keep cool now!”⁠—Would he never say the word?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard the falling horses shriek; they heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smack of smitten flesh, the whispering rush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of arrows, bullets whipping through the brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flicked sand <i>phutting</i>; saw the rolling eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of war-mad ponies, crooked battle cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lost in the uproar, faces in a blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of color, color, and the whirlwind last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all dear things forever.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">“<em>Now!</em>”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">The fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fleet, sick dream of friendly things and dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dissolved in thunder; and between two breaths</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men sensed the sudden splendor that is Death’s,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wild clairvoyant wonder. Shadows screamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the kicking Spencers, split and streamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the island in a flame-rent shroud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And momently, with hoofs that beat the cloud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Winged with the mad momentum of the charge,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A war horse loomed unnaturally large</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the burning ring of rifles there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lit, sprawling, in the midst and took the air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And vanished. And the storming hoofs roared by.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly the sun, a handbreadth high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was peering through the clinging battle-blur.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Along the stream, wherever bushes were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or clumps of bluejoint, lurking rifles played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the isle⁠—a point-blank enfilade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Horse-slaughtering and terrible to stand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And southward there along the rising land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And northward where the valley was a plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horsemen galloped, and a pelting rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of arrows fell.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Now someone, lying near</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forsyth, was yelling in his neighbor’s ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“They’ve finished Sandy!” For a giant whip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, laid hot along the Colonel’s hip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lash of torture, and his face went gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pinched. And voices boomed above the fray,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Is Sandy dead?” So, rising on a knee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That anyone who feared for him might see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shouted: “Never mind⁠—it’s nothing bad!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And noting how the wild face of a lad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yearned up at him⁠—the youngest face of all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With cheeks like Rambeau apples in the fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eyes old as terror⁠—“Son, you’re doing well!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He cried and smiled; and that one lived to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The glory of it in the after days.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now presently the Colonel strove to raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tortured hip to ease it, when a stroke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a dull ax bit a shin that broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath his weight. Dragged backward in a pit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sat awhile against the wall of it</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strove to check the whirling of the land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, noticing how some of the command</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pumped lead too fast and threw their shells away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He set about to crawl to where they lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tell them. Something whisked away his hat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for a green-sick minute after that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sky rained stars. Then vast ear-hollows rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brazen noises, and a sullen pang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a fire that smouldered in his skull.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gazed about him groggily. A lull</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fallen on the battle, and he saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How pairs of horsemen galloped down the draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recovering the wounded and the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snipers on the river banks had fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To safer berths; but mounted hundreds still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swarmed yonder on the flat and on the hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And long range arrows fell among the men.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The island had become a slaughter pen.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all the mules and horses, one alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still stood. He wobbled with a gurgling moan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Legs wide, his drooping muzzle dripping blood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some still wallowed in a scarlet mud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And strove to rise, with threshing feet aloft.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But most lay still, as when the spring is soft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And work-teams share the idleness of cows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Sunday, and a glutted horse may drowse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Loose-necked, forgetting how the plowshare drags.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bill Wilson yonder lay like bundled rags,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so did Chalmers. Farley over there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With one arm limp, was taking special care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the other do; it did, no doubt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Morton yonder with an eye shot out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was firing slowly, but his gun barrel shook.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Mooers, the surgeon, with a sightless look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mingled expectation and surprise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had got a bullet just above the eyes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Death was busy and neglected him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now all the while, beneath the low hill rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To southward, where a sunning slope arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To look upon the slaughter, Roman Nose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was sitting, naked of his battle-gear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain his chestnut stallion, tethered near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had sniffed the battle, whinnying to go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where horses cried to horses there below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men to men. By now a puzzled word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran round the field, and baffled warriors heard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And out of bloody mouths the dying spat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The question: “Where is Roman Nose, the Bat?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While other men are dying, where is he?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So certain of the mighty rode to see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And found him yonder sitting in the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They squatted round him silently. And one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Got courage for a voice at length, and said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Your people there are dying, and the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are many.” But the Harrier of Men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kept silence. And the bold one, speaking then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To those about him, said: “You see today</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The one whom all the warriors would obey,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whatever he might wish. His heart is faint.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He has not even found the strength to paint</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His face, you see!” The Flame of Many Roofs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still smouldered there. The Midnight Wind of Hoofs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kept mute. “Our brothers, the Arapahoes,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another said, “will tell of Roman Nose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their squaws will scorn him; and the Sioux will say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>‘He was not like the men we were that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When all the soldiers died by Peno ford!’ ”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They saw him wince, as though the words had gored</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His vitals. Then he spoke. His voice was low.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“My medicine is broken. Long ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One made a bonnet for a mighty man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My father’s father; and the good gift ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From sire to son, and we were men of might.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For he who wore the bonnet in a fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could look on Death, and Death would fear him much,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So long as he should let no metal touch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The food he ate. But I have been a fool.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A woman lifted with an iron tool</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bread I ate this morning. What you say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is good to hear.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">He cast his robe away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Got up and took the bonnet from its case</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And donned it; put the death-paint on his face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mounted, saying “Now I go to die!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thereat he lifted up a bull-lunged cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That clamored far among the hills around;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dying men took courage at the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And muttered “He is coming.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Now it fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That those upon the island heard a yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And looked about to see from whence it grew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw a war-horse hurtled from the blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A big-boned chestnut, clean and long of limb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That did not dwarf the warrior striding him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So big the man was. Naked as the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The neighbors sought his mother’s lodge to say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“This child shall be a trouble to his foes”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Save for a gorgeous bonnet), Roman Nose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came singing on the run. And as he came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mad hundreds hailed him, booming like a flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rages over slough grass, pony tall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They formed behind him in a solid wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And halted at a lifting of his hand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troopers heard him bellow some command.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw him wheel and wave his rifle high;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And distant hills were peopled with the cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He flung at Death, that mighty men of old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long dead, might hear the coming of the bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And know the land still nursed the ancient breed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, followed by a thundering stampede,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He charged the island where the rifles brawled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some who galloped nearest him recalled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In after days, what some may choose to doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How suddenly the hubbuboo went out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In silence, and a wild white brilliance broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About him, and the cloud of battle smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was thronged with faces not of living men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then terribly the battle roared again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And those who tell it saw him reel and sag</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the stallion, like an empty bag,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then slip beneath the mill of pony hoofs.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So Roman Nose, the Flame of Many Roofs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flared out. And round the island swept the foe⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrath-howling breakers with an undertow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pain that wailed and murmuring dismay.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Beecher, with the limp he got that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Gettysburg, rose feebly from his place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unearthly moon-dawn breaking on his face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And staggered over to the Colonel’s pit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half crawling and half falling into it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I think I have a fatal wound,” he said;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from his mouth the hard words bubbled red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In witness of the sort of hurt he had.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“No, Beecher, no! It cannot be so bad!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other begged, though certain of the end;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For even then the features of the friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were getting queer. “Yes, Sandy, yes⁠—goodnight,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stricken muttered. Whereupon the fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No longer roared for him; but one who grieved</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fought thereby could hear the rent chest heaved</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With struggling breath that couldn’t leave the man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And by and by the whirling host began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To scatter, most withdrawing out of range.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Astonished at the suddenness of change</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From dawn to noon, the troopers saw the sun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>To eastward yonder women had begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To glean the fallen, wailing as they piled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The broken loves of mother, maid and child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On pony-drags; remembering their wont</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of heaping thus the harvest of the hunt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fill the kettles these had sat around.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Forsyth now strove to view the battleground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But could not for the tortured hip and limb;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so they passed a blanket under him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And four men heaved the corners; then he saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Well, Grover, have they other cards to draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or have they played the pack?” he asked a scout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that one took a plug of chewing out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gnawed awhile, then spat and said: “Dunno;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ve fit with Injuns thirty year or so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never see the like of this till now.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We made a lot of good ones anyhow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whatever else⁠—.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Just then it came to pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some rifles, hidden yonder in the grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took up the sentence with a snarling rip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made men duck. One let his corner slip.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Colonel tumbled, and the splintered shin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went crooked, and the bone broke through the skin;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But what he said his angel didn’t write.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas plain the foe had wearied of the fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though scores of wary warriors kept the field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And circled, watching for a head revealed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the slaughtered horses. Afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waned slowly, and a wind began to croon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like memory. The sapling cottonwood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Responded with a voice of widowhood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The melancholy heavens wove a pall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Night hid the valley. Rain began to fall.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>How good is rain when from a sunlit scarp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of heaven falls a silver titan’s harp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For winds to play on, and the new green swirls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the dancing feet of April girls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thunder-claps applaud the meadow lark!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How dear to be remembered⁠—rainy dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Youth and Wonder snuggle safe abed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hear creation bustling overhead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fitful hushes when the eave <i>drip-drops</i></span>
						<br/>
						<span>And everything about the whole house stops</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hear what now the buds and grass may think!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Night swept the island with a brush of ink.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard the endless drizzle sigh and pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whisper to the bushes and the grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Sh⁠—sh</i>⁠—for men were dying in the rain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was that low singing that is pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And curses muttered lest a stout heart break.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As one who lies with fever half awake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sets the vague real shepherding a drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of errant dreams, the broken Colonel strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For order in the nightmare. Willing hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With knife and plate fell digging in the sands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And throwing out a deep surrounding trench.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Graves, yawning briefly in the inky drench,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were satisfied with something no one saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Carved horse meat passed around for wolfing raw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And much was cached to save it from the sun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the work about the camp was done</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the wounds had got rude handed care,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Colonel called the men about him there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spoke of Wallace eighty miles away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who started yonder might not see the day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet two must dare that peril with the tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of urgent need; and if the two should fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God help the rest!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">It seemed that everyone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who had an arm left fit to raise a gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And legs for swinging leather begged to go.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But all agreed with old Pierre Trudeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grizzled trapper, when he “ ’lowed he knowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie like a farmer did a road,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many was the Injun he had fooled.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Stillwell’s youth and daring overruled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The others. Big he was and fleet of limb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for his laughing pluck men honored him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite that weedy age when boys begin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To get a little conscious of the chin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And jokers dub them “Whiskers” for the lack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These two were swallowed in the soppy black</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wearily the sodden night dragged by.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At last the chill rain ceased. A dirty sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Leaked morning. Culver, Farley, Day and Smith</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had found a comrade to adventure with</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And come upon the country that is kind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Mooers was slow in making up his mind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To venture, though with any breath he might.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stark to the drab indecency of light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tumbled heaps, that once were horses, lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With naked ribs and haunches lopped away⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Good friends at need with all their fleetness gone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like wolves that smell a feast the foe came on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A skulking pack. They met a gust of lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That flung them with their wounded and their dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back to the spying summits of the hills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Content to let the enemy that kills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without a wound complete the task begun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Dawn cleared the sky, and all day long the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shone hotly through a lens of amethyst⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some incorrigible optimist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who overworks the sympathetic role.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All day the troopers sweltered in the bowl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of soppy sand, and wondered if the two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were dead by now; or had they gotten through?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if they hadn’t⁠—What about the meat?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another day or two of steaming heat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would fix it for the buzzards and the crows;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there’d be choicer banqueting for those</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>If no one came.</span>
							<span>So when a western hill</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Burned red and blackened, and the stars came chill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two others started crawling down the flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Wallace; and for long hours after that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men listened, listened, listened for a cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But heard no sound. And just before the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to pale, the two stole back unhurt.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dark was full of shadow men, alert</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To block the way wherever one might go.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Alas, what chance for Stillwell and Trudeau?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That day the dozen wounded bore their plight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less cheerfully than when the rainy night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had held so great a promise. All day long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who hums a half forgotten song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By poignant bits, the dying surgeon moaned;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the west was getting sober-toned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He choked a little and forgot the tune.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men were silent, wondering how soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’d be like that.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Now when the tipping Wain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the Star, poured slumber on the plain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jack Donovan and Pliley disappeared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down river where the starry haze made weird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The narrow gulch. They seemed as good as dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all next day the parting words they said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“We won’t be coming back,” were taken wrong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fourth sun since the battle lingered long.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Putrescent horseflesh now befouled the air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some tried to think they liked the prickly pear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some tightened up their belts a hole or so.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And certain of the wounded babbled low</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of places other than the noisome pits,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the fever sped their straying wits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like homing bumblebees that know the hive.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That day the Colonel found his leg alive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With life that wasn’t his.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">The fifth sun crept;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The evening dawdled; morning overslept.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the dark would never go away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kiotes filled it with a roundelay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of toothsome horses smelling to the sky.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But somehow morning happened by and by.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All day the Colonel scanned the prairie rims</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And found it hard to keep away the whims</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dogged him; often, wide awake, he dreamed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The more he thought of it, the more it seemed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all should die of hunger wasn’t fair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so he called the sound men round him there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spoke of Wallace and the chance they stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make their way to safety, if they would.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As for himself and other cripples⁠—well,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’d take a chance, and if the worst befell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were soldiers.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">There was silence for a space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While each man slyly sought his neighbor’s face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see what better thing a hope might kill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then there was one who growled: “The hell we will!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We’ve fought together and we’ll die so too!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One might have thought relief had come in view</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hear the shout that rose.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">The slow sun sank.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The empty prairie gloomed. The horses stank.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kiotes sang. The starry dark was cold.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That night the prowling wolves grew over bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one was cooking when the sun came up.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It gave the sick a little broth to sup;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the rest, they joked and made it do.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all day long the cruising buzzards flew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the island, eager to descend;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While, raucously prophetic of the end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crows wheeled round it hungrily to pry;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mounted warriors loomed against the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To peer and vanish. Darkness fell at last;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the daylight came and when it passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Colonel scarcely knew, for things got mixed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The moment was forever, strangely fixed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And never in a moment. Still he kept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One certain purpose, even when he slept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To cheer the men by seeming undismayed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the eighth dawn came, he grew afraid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of his own weakness. Stubbornly he sat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His tortured face half hidden by his hat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And feigned to read a novel one had found</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the baggage. But the print went round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wouldn’t talk however it was turned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At last the morning of the ninth day burned.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again he strove to regiment the herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dancing letters into marching words,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When suddenly the whole command went mad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They yelled; they danced the way the letters had;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They tossed their hats.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Then presently he knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas cavalry that made the hillside blue⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cavalry from Wallace!</span>

						<span class="i14">Autumn’s goad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had thronged the weed-grown Powder River Road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bison following the shrinking green.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again the Platte and Smoky Hill had seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The myriads nosing at the dusty hem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Summer’s robe; and, drifting after them,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wild marauders vanished. Winter came;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lo! the homesteads echoed with a name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That was a ballad sung, a saga told;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, once men heard it, somehow it was old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Time’s rich hoarding and the bardic lyres.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By night the settlers hugged their cowchip fires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And talked of Custer, while the children heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way the wild wind dramatized the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With men and horses roaring to the fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And valiant bugles crying down the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far-blown from Cedar Creek or Fisher’s Hill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in their sleep they saw him riding still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A part of all things wonderful and past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His bright hair streaming in the battle blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above a surf of sabres! Roofs of shale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And soddy walls seemed safer for the tale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie kinder for that name of awe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now the Battle of the Washita</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was fought at every hearthstone in the land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas song to talk of Custer and his band:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blizzard dawn, the march from Camp Supply,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blind daring with the compass for an eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pierce the writhing haze; the icy fords,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The freezing sleeps; the finding of the hordes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That deemed the bitter weather and the snows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their safety⁠—Kiowas, Arapahoes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cheyennes, Comanches⁠—miles of river flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One village; Custer crouching like a cat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the drifts; the numbing lapse of night;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brass band blaring in the first wan light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cheers, the neighing, and the wild swoop down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To widow-making in a panic town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of widow-makers! O ’twas song to say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Old Black Kettle paid his life that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For bloody dawns of terror! Lyric words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dwelt long upon his slaughtered pony herds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His lodges burning for the roofs that blazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That dreadful year! Rejoicing Kansas raised</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her eyes beyond the days of her defeat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw her hills made mighty with the wheat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tasselled com ranks marching on the plain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wonder-working of the sun and rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And faith and labor; plenty out of dearth;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Man’s mystic marriage with the virgin Earth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hard-won bride.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">And April came anew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But there were those⁠—and they were human too⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whom the memory of other springs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sought vainly in the growing dusk of things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ancient joy. Along the Smoky Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The might they could no longer hope to kill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brawled west again, where maniacs of toil</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were chaining down the violated soil,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And plows went wiving in the bison range,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An alien-childed mother growing strange</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With younger loves. May deepened in the sloughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When down the prairie swept the wonder news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of what had happened at the Great Salt Lake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how, at last, the crawling iron snake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Platte had lengthened to the sea.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So shadows of a thing that was to be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew darker in the land.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Four years went by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the solemn music of a lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kept peace in all the country of the Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unharried yonder, still the bison knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The meadows of Absoraka and throve;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now no more the Hoary Herdsman drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His countless cattle past the great Platte road.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still honoring the treaty, water flowed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And grass grew, faithful to the plighted word.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then yonder on the Yellowstone was heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clank of sabers; and the Red Men saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Yellow Hair, the Wolf of Washita,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went spying with his pack along the stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While others, bitten with a crazy dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were driving stakes and peeping up the flat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just so it was that summer on the Platte</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the evil came. And devil boats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came up with stinking thunder in their throats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To scare the elk and make the bison shy.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So there was fighting yonder where the lie</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was singing flat; though nothing came of it.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And once again the stunted oaks were lit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And down across the prairie howled the cold;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spring came back, exactly as of old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To resurrect the waters and the grass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The summer deepened peacefully⁠—alas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last of happy summers, cherished long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Sorrow hoards the wreckage of a song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose wounding lilt is dearer for the wound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The children laughed; contented mothers crooned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About their lodges. Nothing was afraid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The warriors talked of hunting, in the shade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or romped with crowing babies on their backs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The meat was plenty on the drying racks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The luscious valleys made the ponies glad;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And travellers knew nothing that was bad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tell of any village they had known.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No white men yonder on the Yellowstone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor any sign of trouble anywhere!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then once again the name of Yellow Hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was heard with dread; for Summer, turning brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld him lead a thousand horsemen down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pierce the Hills where Inyan Kara towers,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brawl southward through that paradise of flowers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And deer and singing streams to Frenchman Creek;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld him even climbing Harney Peak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To spy the land, as who should say him no!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had grasses failed? Had water ceased to flow?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were pledges wind?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Now scarce the sloughs were sere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Custer, crying in the wide world’s ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What every need and greed could understand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made all men see the Black Hills wonderland</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Fortune waited, ready with a bow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What fertile valleys pining for the plow!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What lofty forests given to the birds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What luscious cattle pastures to the herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of elk and deer! What flower-enchanted parks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now lonely with the quails and meadowlarks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaited men beneath the shielding peaks!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the creeks⁠—in all the crystal creeks⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blessèd creeks⁠—O wonder to behold!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Free gold⁠—the god of rabbles⁠—holy gold⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gold in plenty from the grass-roots down!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The Black Hills Country! Heard in every town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That incantation of a wizard horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrought madness. Farmers caught it in the corn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shuck no more. No glory of the sward</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outdazzled yonder epiphanic Lord⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The only revelation that was sure!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through the cities went the singing lure,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where drearily the human welter squirms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like worms that lick the slime of other worms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all may flourish. Squalor saw the gleam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And paupers mounted in a splendid dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The backs of luckless men, for now the weak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inherited the earth! The fat, the sleek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Envisaged that apocalypse, and saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obesity to put the cringe of awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In knees of leanness!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Sell the family cow!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go pawn the homestead! Life was knocking now!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There might not ever be another knock.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bring forth the hoarding of the hidden sock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Poor coppers from the dear dead eyes of Joy!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go seek the god that weighs the soul by troy;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Be saved, and let the devil take the rest!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The West⁠—the golden West⁠—the siren West⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold the rainbow’s end among her peaks!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For in the creeks⁠—in all the crystal creeks⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blessèd creeks⁠—!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">So wrought the rueful dream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chinooks of hope fed full the human stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brief thawings of perennial despair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And steadily the man-flood deepened there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With every moon along the Sioux frontier,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where still the treaty held⁠—a rotten wier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already trickling with a leak of men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some of those came drifting back again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transfigured palmers from the Holy Lands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With true salvation gleaming in their hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now cleansed of labor. Thus the wonder grew.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And there were flinty hearts among the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fall and winter. Childish, heathen folk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their god was but a spirit to invoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the hushes of a lonely hill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An awfulness when winter nights were still;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mystery, a yearning to be felt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When birds returned and snow began to melt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And miracles were doing in the grass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Negotiable Divinity, alas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They had not yet the saving grace to know!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Nor did the hard hearts soften with the snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When from the high gray wilderness of rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Johannine voices of the goose and crane</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foretold the Coming to a world enthralled;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For still along the teeming border brawled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ever growing menace.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Summer bloomed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But many, with the prescience of the doomed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could feel the shaping of the end of things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all that gladness. How the robin sings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sweeter in the ghastly calm that aches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With beauty lost, before the cyclone breaks!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And helpless watchers feel it as a pang,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because of all the times the robin sang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce noted in the melody of then.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the lodges gray and toothless men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bemoaned the larger time when life was good.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><em>Hey-hey</em>, what warriors then, what hardihood!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What terror of the Sioux among their foes!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What giants, gone, alas, these many snows⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they who knew so near their taking off!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now beggars at the Great White Father’s trough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forgot the bow and waited to be swilled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The woman-hearted god the White Man killed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bewitched the people more with every moon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The buffalo would join the fathers soon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The world was withered like a man grown old.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A few more grasses, and the Sioux would hold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little paper, dirtied with a lie,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all that used to be. ’Twas time to die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span><em>Hey-hey</em>, the braver days when life was new!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But there were strong hearts yet among the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite the mumbling of the withered gums.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That summer young men chanted to the drums</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mighty deeds; and many went that fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull and Gall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were shepherding their people on the Tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Powder yet, as when the world was young,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Contemptuous of alien ways and gods.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the candles of the goldenrods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were guttering about the summer’s bier,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And unforgetting days were hushed to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some rumor of a lone belated bird,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It came to pass the Great White Father’s word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assembled many on the White to meet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Long Knife chieftains. Bitter words and sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew rankly there; and stubbornly the wills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of children met the hagglers for the Hills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lust for gold begetting lust for gold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young moon grew and withered and was old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the latest word was like the first.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then talking ended and the man-dam burst</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To loose the living flood upon the West.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All winter long it deepened, and the crest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came booming with the February thaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The torrent setting in through Omaha</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ground many a grist of greed, and loud Cheyenne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Became a tail-race running mules and men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hell-bent for Eldorado. Yankton vied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Sidney in the combing of the tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For costly wreckage. Giddily it swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Custer City shouted to the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Deadwood was a howl, and Nigger Hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cry from Pisgah. Unabated still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Innumerable distant freshets flowed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bison trail became a rutted road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prairie schooners cruised the rolling Spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In labor with a monstrous farrowing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The river packets grunted; and the plains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were startled at the spawning of the trains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Platte.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">So, bitten by the imp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of much-for-nought, the gambler and the pimp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hero and the coward and the fool,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pious reader of the golden rule</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By decimals, the dandy and the gawk,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The human eagle and the wingless hawk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alert for prey, the graybeard and the lad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The murderer, the errant Galahad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mistaken in the color of the gleam⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All dreamers of the old pathetic dream⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursued what no pursuing overtakes.</span>

						<p epub:type="title">The Village of Crazy Horse</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>Meanwhile among the Powder River breaks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where cottonwoods and plums and stunted oaks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made snug his village of a hundred smokes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young Crazy Horse was waiting for the spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well found his people were in everything</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That makes a winter good. But more than food</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shelter from the hostile solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sustained them yonder when the sun fled far</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rustling ghost-lights capered round the Star</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And moons were icy and the blue snow whined;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or when for days the world went blizzard blind</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And devils of the North came howling down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For something holy moved about the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Crazy Horse.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">No chieftainship had run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long cherished in the blood of sire and son,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To clothe him with the might he wielded then.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Ogalalas boasted taller men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But few of fairer body. One might look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And think of water running in a brook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or maybe of a slender hickory tree;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And something in his face might make one see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flinty shaft-head very keen to go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because a hero’s hand is on the bow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eye upon the mark. But nothing seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About his goodly making or his mien</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Explained the man; and other men were bold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unnumbered were the stories that were told</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(And still the legend glorified the truth)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About his war-fond, pony-taming youth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Hump the Elder was a man to fear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where one went, the other would be near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there was love between the man and lad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And it was good to tell what fights they had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With roving bands of Utes or Snakes or Crows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now that Hump was gone these many snows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His prowess lingered. So the legend ran.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But neither Hump nor any other man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could give the gift that was a riddle still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What lonely vigils on a starry hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What fasting in the time when boyhood dies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had put the distant seeing in his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The power in his silence? What had taught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That getting is a game that profits naught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And giving is a high heroic deed?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His plenty never neighbored with a need</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among his band. A good tough horse to ride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gear of war, and some great dream inside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were Crazy Horse’s wealth. It seemed the dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And larger past had wandered back in him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shield his people in the days of wrong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His thirty years were like a brave old song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That men remember and the women croon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make their babies brave.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Now when the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had wearied of December and was gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bitterly the blizzard time came on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Great White Father had a word to say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The frost-bit runners rode a weary way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bring the word, and this is what it said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“All bands, before another moon is dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must gather at the agencies or share</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fate of hostiles.” Grandly unaware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of aught but its own majesty and awe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The big word blustered. Yet the people saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snow-sift snaking in the grasses, heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Northwind bellow louder than the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make them shudder with the winter fear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“You see that there are many children here,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said Crazy Horse. “Our herd is getting lean.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We can not go until the grass is green.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It is a very foolish thing you say.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so the surly runners rode away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Crazy Horse’s people stayed at home.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And often were the days a howling gloam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between two howling darks; nor could one tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When morning broke and when the long night fell;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twas a winter such as old men cite</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To overawe and set the youngsters right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With proper veneration for the old.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ponies huddled humpbacked in the cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, dog-like, gnawed the bark of cottonwood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But where the cuddled rawhide lodges stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men laughed and yarned and let the blizzard roar,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwitting how the tale the runners bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prepared the day of sorrow.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">March boomed in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the people revelled in their sin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor thought of woe already on the way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, when the night was longer than the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By just about an old man’s wink and nod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As sudden as the storied wrath of God,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarce more human, retribution came.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The moony wind that night was like a flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To sear whatever naked flesh it kissed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dry snow powder coiled and struck and hissed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the lodges. Haloes mocked the moon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The boldest tale was given over soon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For kinder evenings; and the dogs were still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the prowling foe no pack might kill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The subtle fang that feared not any fang.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ever nearer, nearer, shod hoofs rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To southward, unsuspected in the town.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three cavalry battalions, flowing down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rugged canyon bed of Otter Creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Reynolds, clattered out across the bleak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High prairie, eerie in the fitful light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where ghostly squadrons howled along the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their stinging sabers gleaming in the wind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All night they sought the village that had sinned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet slept the sleep of virtue, unafraid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Bear swung round; the stars began to fade;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The low moon stared. Then, floating in the puffs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wind-whipped snow, the Powder River bluffs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gloomed yonder, and the scouts came back to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many sleeping lodges.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Now it fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That when the bluffs were paling with the glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dawn, and still the teepee tops below</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood smokeless in the stupor of a dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Sioux boy, strolling down the frozen stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find his ponies, wondered at the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many hoofs upon the frozen ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The swishing of the brush. He paused to think.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The herd, no doubt, was coming for a drink;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d have to chop a hole. And while he stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The spell of dawn upon him, from the wood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How queer!⁠—they issued marching four by four</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though enchanted, breasts and muzzles hoar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With frozen breath! Were all the ponies dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And these their taller spirits?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">—Then he fled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The frightened trees and bushes flowing dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blanching bluff tops flinging back at him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His many-echoed yell. A frowsy squaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thrust up a lodge flap, blinked about her⁠—saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What ailed her boy, and fell to screaming shrill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The startled wolf-dogs, eager for a kill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rushed yelping from the lodges. Snapping sharp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere a short string parting in a harp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A frosty rifle sounded. Teepees spilled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A half clad rabble, and the valley filled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With uproar, spurting into jets of pain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now there swept a gust of killing rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where the plunging horses in a cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of powder smoke bore down upon the crowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set it scrambling wildly for the breaks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The waddling grandmas lost their precious aches</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In terror for the young they dragged and drove;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hysteric mothers staggered as they strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To pack the creepers and the toddlers too;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And grandpas, not forgetting they were Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made shift to do a little with the bows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While stubbornly the young men after those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retreated fighting through the lead-swept town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up the sounding steeps.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">There, looking down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the track of terror splotched with red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dotted with the wounded and the dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw the blue-coats rage among their roofs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their homes flung down and given to the hoofs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of desecrating wrath. And while they gazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In helpless grief and fury, torches blazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And teepees kindled. Casks of powder, stored</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against a doubtful future, belched and roared.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hurtled lodge poles showered in the gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rawhide tops, like glutted bats of doom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sailed tumbling in the dusk of that despair.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Not long the routed warriors cowered there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the rocks and gullies of the steep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The weakness of a panic-broken sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wore off. Their babies whimpered in the frost.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their herd was captured. Everything seemed lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But life alone. It made them strong to die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The death-song, stabbed with many a battle cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blew down the flat⁠—a blizzard of a sound⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the rocks and draws and brush around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spat smoke and arrows in a closing ring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There fell a sudden end of plundering.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Abruptly as they came the raiders fled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And certain of their wounded, men have said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were left to learn what hells are made of wrath.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now, gleaning in that strewn tornado path</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their dead and dying, came the mourning folk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To find a heap for home, a stinking smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For plenty. Senseless to the whirling snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the bitter honey of their woe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They swarmed and moaned. What evil had they done?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dear eyes, forever empty of the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stared up at them. These little faces, old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With pain, and pinched with more than winter cold⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why should they never seek the breast again?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A keening such as wakes the wolf in men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outwailed the wind. Yet many a thrifty wife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long used to serve the urgencies of life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That make death seem a laggard’s impudence,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Descended in a rage of commonsense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the wreck, collecting what would do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fend the cold.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Now while the village grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A miracle of patches, jerry-built,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young men, hot upon the trail of guilt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Crazy Horse, found many a huddled stray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forlorn along the thousand-footed way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stolen herd had gone. And all day long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their fury warmed them and their hearts were strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet with any death a man might die;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For still they heard the wounded children cry,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mourning of the women for the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did they deem that any hero led</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The raiders. Surely nothing but the greed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of terror could devour at such a speed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That pony-laming wallow, drift on drift.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The blue dusk mingled with the driven sift,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still it seemed the trail of headlong flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was making for the wilderness of night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And safety. Then, a little way below</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mouth of Lodge Pole Creek, a dancing glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went up the bluff. Some few crept close to see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what they saw was listless misery</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That crouched and shivered in a smudge of sage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How well they cooled their baby-killing rage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those tentless men without a bite to eat!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many, rubbing snow upon their feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made faces that were better to behold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than how their shaking horses took the cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With tight-tailed rumps against the bitter flaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the camp and scattered up the draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hungry ponies pawed the frozen ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was no one anywhere around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guard them. White-man medicine was weak.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now all the young men, hearing, burned to wreak</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their hate upon the foe. A wiser will</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Restrained them. “Wait a better time to kill,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said Crazy Horse. “Our lives are few to give</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And theirs are many. Can our people live</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without the herd? We must not die today.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The time will come when I will lead the way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where many die.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Like hungry wolves that prowl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The melancholy marches of the owl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where cows and calves are grazing unafraid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pony stalkers went. A stallion neighed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ears pricked to question what the dusk might bring;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then all the others fell to whinnying</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yonder in the camp the soldiers heard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some rose to point where many shadows, blurred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With driven snow and twilight, topped a rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And vanished in the smother. Jeering cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came struggling back and perished in the bruit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of charging wind. No bugles of pursuit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused the camp. Night howled along the slough.</span>

					<p>
						<span>Now wheresoever thawing breezes blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And green began to prickle in the brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There went the tale of Crazy Horse’s town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To swell a mood already growing there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For something more than Spring was in the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, mightier than any maiden’s eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Lilith-lure of Perilous Emprise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was setting all the young men’s blood astir.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How fair the more than woman face of her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose smile has gulfed how many a daring prow!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What cities burn for jewels on her brow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her lips what vintages are red!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her lovers are the tallest of the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forever. When the streams of Troas rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So many heroes seaward, she was old;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet she is young forever to the young.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas now the murmur of the man-flood, flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Hills, grew ominously loud.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole white world seemed lifted in a cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To sweep the prairie with a monstrous rain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slay one, and there were fifty to be slain!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Give fifty to the flame for torturing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then count the marching multitude of Spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Green blade by blade!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Still wilder rumors grew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They told of soldiers massed against the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And waiting till the grass was good, to fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull and Gall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That all the country might be safe for theft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nothing of a warrior race be left</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But whining beggars in a feeding pen.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alas, the rights of men⁠—of other men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That centenary season of the Free!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No doubt the situation wanted tea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make it clear! But long before the green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had topped the hills, the agencies grew lean</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of youth and courage. Did a watch dog bark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Midway between the owl and meadowlark?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then other lads with bow and shield and lance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were making for the Region of Romance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Sitting Bull’s weird medicine was strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Crazy Horse’s name was like a song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A happy warrior sings before he dies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Gall’s a wind of many battle cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That flings a thousand ponies on the doomed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So where the Powder and the Rosebud boomed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men met as water of the melting snows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The North Cheyennes and North Arapahoes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Become one people in a common cause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Brulés, Minneconjoux, Hunkpapas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sans Arcs and Ogalalas, came to throng</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valleys; and the villages were long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With camp on camp. Nor was there any bluff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the country, that was tall enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To number half the ponies at a look.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here young June came with many tales of Crook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Gray Fox, marching up the Bozeman Road.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How long a dust above his horsemen flowed!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How long a dust his walking soldiers made!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What screaming thunder when the pack-mules brayed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the six-mule wagon teams replied!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The popping of the whips on sweaty hide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How like a battle when the foe is bold!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the North still other tales were told</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By those who heard the steamboats wheeze and groan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With stuffs of war along the Yellowstone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To feed the camps already waiting there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awaiting what? The might of Yellow Hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now coming from the Heart’s mouth! Rumor guessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many Snakes were riding from the West</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To join the Whites against their ancient foes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many Rees, how many of the Crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembered to be jealous of the Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look north, look south⁠—the cloud of trouble grew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look east, look west⁠—the whole horizon frowned.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But it was better to be ringed around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With enemies, to battle and to fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than be a beggar chief like Spotted Tail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>However fattened by a hated hand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the full moon flooded all the land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the laughter of the owls began,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They turned to One who, mightier than Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could help them most⁠—the Spirit in the sun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whatsoever wonder-work is done</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the needy earth, he does it all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For him the whole world sickens in the fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When streams cease singing and the skies go gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And trees and bushes weep their leaves away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In hopeless hushes empty of the bird,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all day long and all night long are heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The high geese wailing after their desire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, even so, his saving gift of fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is given unto miserable men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until they see him face to face again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all his magic happen, none knows how.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was the time when he is strongest now;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so a holy man whose heart was good</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went forth to find the sacred cottonwood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Belovèd of the Spirit. Straight and high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thing of worship yearning for the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It flourished, sunning in a lonely draw;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there none heard the holy man nor saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What rites were done, save only one who knows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From whence the new moon comes and whither goes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old, and what the stars do all day long.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thereafter came the people with a song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The men, the boys, the mothers and the maids,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All posy-crowns and blossom-woven braids,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though a blooming meadow came to see.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fruitful women danced about the tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make the Spirit glad; for, having known</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The laughter of the children of their own,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some goodness of the earth, the giving one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was in them and was pleasing to the Sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie-loving nourisher of seed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A warrior who had done the bravest deed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet dared that year by any of the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now struck the trunk as one who counts a coup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a dreaded foe; and prairie gifts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gave among the poor, for nothing lifts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The heart like giving. Let the coward save⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big hoard and little heart; but still the brave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Have more with nothing! Singing virgins came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose eyes had never learned to droop with shame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was there any present, man or youth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could say them aught of ill and say the truth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For sweet as water in a snow-born brook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where many birches come and lean to look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along a mountain gorge, their spirits were.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each one took the ax they gave to her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And smote the tree with many a lusty stroke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a groan the sleeper in it ’woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And far hills heard the falling shout of him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still rang the axes, cleaving twig and limb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the tapered beauty of the bole,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, naked to the light, the sacred pole</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay waiting for the bearers.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">They who bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were chieftains, and their fathers were before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all of them had fasted, as they should;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet none dared touch the consecrated wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With naked fingers, out of pious fear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once for every season of the year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They paused along the way, remembering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With thanks alike the autumn and the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The winter and the summer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Then it fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That many warriors, lifting up a yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That set their ponies plunging, thundered down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the center of the circled town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where presently the holy tree should stand;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whosoever first of all the band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could strike the sacred spot with bow or spear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might gallop deep among the dead that year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet be of those whom busy Death forgot.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sweaty battle raged about the spot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where screaming ponies, rearing to the thrust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of screaming ponies, clashed amid the dust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And riders wrestled in the hoof-made gloam.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So, having safely brought the sun-tree home,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The people feasted as for victory.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And on the second day they dressed the tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And planted it with sacred songs and vows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And round it reared a wall of woven boughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That opened to the mystic source of day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with the next dawn mothers came to lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their babies down before the holy one,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each coveting a hero for a son</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or sturdy daughters fit to nurse the bold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then when the fourth dawn came the war drums rolled;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from their lodges, lean and rendered pure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With meatless days, those vowing to endure</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The death-in-torture to be born again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came naked there before the holy men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who painted them with consecrated paint.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if a knee seemed loosened, it was faint</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fast and weary vigil, not with dread;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For lo! the multitudinary dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pressed round to see if heroes such as they</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still walked the earth despite the smaller day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When ’twas not half so easy to be brave.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now, prone beneath the pole, as in a grave,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without a wince each vower took the blade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In chest or back, and through the wound it made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Endured the passing of the rawhide thong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swung from the pole’s top; raised a battle song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To daunt his anguish; staggered to his feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, leaning, capered to the war drum’s beat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dizzy rigadoon with Agony.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So all day long the spirit-haunted tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bore bloody fruitage, groaning to the strain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For with the dropping of the ripe-in-pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the stem the green-in-courage grew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seldom had there fallen on the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So great a wind of ghostly might as then.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Boys tripped it, bleeding, with the tortured men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mothers, daughters, sisters, sweethearts, wives</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of those who suffered, gashed their flesh with knives</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share a little of the loved one’s pang;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all day long the sunning valley rang</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With songs of courage; and the mother sod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Received the red libation; and the god</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave power to his people.</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i14">Far away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One foggy morning in the midst of May,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fort Lincoln had beheld the marshalling</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Terry’s forces; heard the bugle sing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blaring of the band, the brave hurrah</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Custer’s men recalling Washita</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And confident of yet another soon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How gallantly in column of platoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(So many doomed and given to the ghost)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the weeping women of the post</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They sat their dancing horses on parade!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What made the silence suddenly afraid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, with a brazen crash, the band went whist</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, dimmer in the clinging river mist,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The line swung westward? Did the Ree squaws know,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through some wise terror of the ancient foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To what unearthly land their warriors led</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The squadrons? Better suited to the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than to the quick, their chanting of farewell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew eerie in the shadow, rose and fell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long-drawn yammer of a lonely dog.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when at length the sun broke through the fog,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What reassurance in the wide blue air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The solid hills, and Custer riding there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all the famous Seventh at his heel!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And back of those the glint of flowing steel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the dusty infantry; the sun’s</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young glimmer on the trundled Gatling guns;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the mounted Rees; and after that</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The loaded pack mules straggling up the flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wagons crowding wagons for a mile!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>What premonition of the afterwhile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could darken eyes that saw such glory pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, lilting in a muffled blare of brass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off yonder near the sundering prairie rim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The Girl I Left Behind Me” floated dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As from the unrecoverable years?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was it nothing but a freak of tears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The vision that the grieving women saw?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For suddenly a shimmering veil of awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caught up the van. One could have counted ten</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While Custer and the half of Custer’s men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were riding up a shining steep of sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though to join the dead that do not die</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But haunt some storied heaven of the bold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then it seemed a smoke of battle rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the picture, leaving empty air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the line that slowly shortened there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dropped below the prairie and was gone.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now day by day the column straggled on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While moody May was dribbling out in rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To make a wagon-wallow of the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the Muddy and the upper Heart.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where lifeless hills, as by demonic art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were hewn to forms of wonderment and fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Excited echoes flocked about to hear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And any sound brought riotous applause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So long among the scarps and tangled draws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had clung that silence and the spell of it.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some fiend-deserted city of the Pit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The region seemed, with crumbling domes and spires;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For still it smoked with reminiscent fires,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the midst, as ’twere the stream of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dark flood ran.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">June blustered in with snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the seasons happened in a week.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the Beaver and O’Fallon creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They toiled. Amid the wilderness of breaks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drainage of the lower Powder makes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They found a way and brought the wagons through;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor had they sight or sign of any Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all that land. Here Reno headed south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With packs and half the troopers for the mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Mispah, thence to scout the country west</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the Tongue; while Terry and the rest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pushed onward to the Yellowstone to bide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Gibbon’s men the news of Reno’s ride.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Mid June drew on. Slow days of waiting bred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unhappy rumors. Everybody said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What no one, closely questioned, seemed to know.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enormous numerations of the foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By tentative narration made exact</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tagged with all the circumstance of fact,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discredited the neat official tale.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas well when dawn came burning down the vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And river fogs were lifting like a smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bugles, singing reveille, awoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand-throated clamor in the herd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the hush was like a warning word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And taps had yielded darkness to the owl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A horse’s whinny or a kiote’s howl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made true the wildest rumors of the noon.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So passed the fateful seventeenth of June</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When none might guess how much the gossip lacked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To match the unimaginative fact</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of what the upper Rosebud saw that day:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Crook, with Reno forty miles away,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had met the hordes of Crazy Horse and Gall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the draws belched cavalries, and all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ridges bellowed and the river fen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went dizzy with the press of mounted men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A slant cyclonic tangle; how the dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came not a whit too early, and the lark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld the Gray Fox slinking back amazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Goose Creek; what a dust the victors raised</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When through the Cherish Hills by many a pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They crowded down upon the Greasy Grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To swell the hostile thousands waiting there.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Alas, how wide they made for Yellow Hair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That highway leading to the shining Past!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now came the end of waiting, for at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scouring squadrons, jogging from the south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had joined their comrades at the Rosebud’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With doubtful news. That evening by the fires,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>According to their dreads or their desires,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The men discussed the story that was told</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a trail, not over three weeks old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That led across the country from the Tongue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Struck up the Rosebud forty miles and swung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again to westward over the divide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some said, “We’ll find blue sky the other side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then back to Lincoln soon!” But more agreed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twould not be so with Custer in the lead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“He’ll eat his horses when the hardtack’s gone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till every man’s afoot!” And thereupon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarred veterans remembered other days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Custer⁠—thirsty marches in the blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Texas suns, with stringy mule to chew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And times when splinters of the North Pole blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the lofty Colorado plains;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And muddy going in the sullen rains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Kansas springs, when verily you felt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Your backbone rub the buckle of your belt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because there weren’t any mules to spare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, there were tales to make the rookies stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Custer’s daring and of Custer’s luck.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some recalled that night before they struck</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black Kettle’s village. Whew! And what a night!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A foot of snow, and not a pipe alight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not a fire! You didn’t dare to doze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But kept your fingers on your horse’s nose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fear he’d nicker and the chance be lost.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all night long there, starry in the frost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You’d see the steaming Colonel striding by.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the first light broke along the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet not enough to make a saber shine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You should have seen him gallop down the line</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hair astream! It warmed your blood to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way he clapped his hat beneath his knee</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yelled “Come on!” “Go ask him if we came!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And so they conjured with a magic name;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, wakeful in the darkness after taps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many saddened, conscious of the lapse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of man-denying time!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">The last owl ceased.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pewee sensed the changing of the east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fluted shyly, doubtful of the news.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wolf, returning from an all-night cruise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the rabbits, topped a staring rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And vanished. Now the cooks were stirring dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waist-deep in woodsmoke crawling through the damp.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shadow lifted from the snoring camp.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bugle sang. The horses cried ha! ha!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mule herd raised a woeful fanfara</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To swell the music, singing out of tune.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up came the sun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">The Seventh marched at noon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Six hundred strong. By fours and troop by troop,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With packs between, they passed the Colonel’s group</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Terry’s tent; the Rickarees and Crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Astride their shaggy paints and calicoes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The regimental banner and the grays;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And after them the sorrels and the bays,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whites, the browns, the piebalds and the blacks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One flesh they seemed with those upon their backs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whose weathered faces, like and fit for bronze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some gleam of unforgotten battle-dawns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made bright and hard. The music of their going,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How good to hear!⁠—though mournful beyond knowing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The low-toned chanting of the Crows and Rees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The guidons whipping in a stiff south breeze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prophetical of thunder-brewing weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chiming spurs and bits and crooning leather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shoe calks clinking on the scattered stone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, fusing all, the rolling undertone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hoofs by hundreds rhythmically blent⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The diapason of an instrument</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strung taut for battle music.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">So they passed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Custer, waking from a dream at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With still some glory of it in his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shook hands around and said his last goodbyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swung a leg across his dancing bay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That champed the snaffle, keen to be away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where all the others were. Then Gibbon spoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jocosely, but with something in the joke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of its own pleasantry incredulous:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Now don’t be greedy, Custer! Wait for us!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Custer laughed and gave the bay his head.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I won’t!” he cried. Perplexed at what he said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They watched the glad bay smoking up the draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heard the lusty welcoming hurrah</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That swept along the column. When it died,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The melancholy pack mules prophesied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ghost-mules answered.</span>

						<p epub:type="title">High Noon on the Little Horn</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Now it came to pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That late June morning on the Greasy Grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two men went fishing, warriors of the Sioux;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, lonesome in the silence of the two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A youngster pictured battles on the sand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more beneath the valor of his hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The execrated troopers, blotted out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Became a dust. Then, troubled with a doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He ventured: “Uncle, will they find us here⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers?” ’Twas a buzzing in the ear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Red Hawk where he brooded on his cast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The wind is coming up,” he said at last;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The sky grows dusty.” “Then the fish won’t bits,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said Running Wolf. “There may be rain tonight”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said Red Hawk, falling silent. Bravely then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The youngster wrought himself a world of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where nothing waited on a wind of whim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But everything, obedient to him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell justly. All the white men in the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were huddled there, and round about them swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More warriors than a grownup might surmise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pony-thunder and the battle-cries,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whine of arrows eager for their marks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drowned out the music of the meadowlarks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rising gale that teased the cottonwoods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set them grumbling in their whitened hoods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chatter of a little waterfall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These pebbles⁠—see!⁠—were Crazy Horse and Gall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here Crow King raged, and Black Moon battled there!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This yellow pebble⁠—look!⁠—was Yellow Hair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This drab one with a little splotch of red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Gray Fox, Crook! Ho ho! And both were dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And white men fell about them every place⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The leafage of the autumn of a race⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till all were down. And when their doom was sealed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little victor danced across the field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the soundless singing of a throng.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The brief joy died, for there was something wrong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About this battle. Mournfully came back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That other picture of a dawn attack⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The giant horses rearing in the fogs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of their own breath; the yelping of the dogs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The screaming rabble swarming up the rise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tangled terror in his mother’s eyes;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flaming lodges and the bloody snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Provokingly oblivious of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The two still eyed the waters and were dumb.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“But will they find us, Uncle? Will they come?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Red Hawk grunted, heaving at his line,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, wrought of flying spray and morning-shine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spiral rainbow flashed along the brook.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>Hey hey!</em>” said Red Hawk, staring at his hook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“He got my bait! Run yonder to the bluff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And catch some hoppers, Hohay. Get enough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And you shall see how fish are caught today!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Half-heartedly the youngster stole away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across a brawling riffle, climbed the steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gazed across the panoramic sweep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rolling prairie, tawny in the drouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the Big Horns loomed along the south,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No more than ghosts of mountains in the dust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up here the hot wind, booming gust on gust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made any nook a pleasant place to dream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You could not see the fishers by the stream;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And you were grown so tall that, looking down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the trees, you saw most all the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strung far along the valley. First you saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Cheyennes yonder opposite the draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That yawned upon the ford⁠—a goodly sight!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So many and so mighty in a fight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And always faithful brothers to the Sioux!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trees hid the Brulé village, but you knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas half a bow-shot long from end to end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then Ogalalas filled a river bend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And next the Minneconjoux did the same.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little farther south the Sans Arc came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they were neighbors to the Hunkpapas.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blackened smoke-vents, flapping in the flaws,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were like a startled crow flock taking wing.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some Ogalalas played at toss-the-ring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many idlers crowded round to see.⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grazing ponies wandered lazily</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the flat and up the rolling west.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now, guiltily remembering his quest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He trotted farther up the naked hill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dropped down a gully where the wind was still⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And came upon a hopping army there!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They swarmed, they raged⁠—but Hohay didn’t care;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For suddenly it seemed the recent climb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had been a scramble up the height of time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Hohay’s name was terror in the ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of evil peoples. Seizing weeds for spears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He charged the soldiers with a dreadful shout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snapping of their rifles all about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might daunt a lesser hero. Never mind;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His medicine made all their bullets blind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ’twas a merry slaughter. Then at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shining glory of the vision passed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hoppers were but hoppers as before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he, a very little boy once more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood dwarfed and lonely on a windy rise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun was nearly up the dusty skies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas white with heat and had a funny stare⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All face! The wind had blown away its hair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It looked afraid; as though the sun should fear!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now, squinting downward through the flying blear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He scanned the town. And suddenly the old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembered dawn of terror struck him cold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like startled ants that leave a stricken mound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In silence that is felt as panic sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By one who sees, the squaws and children poured</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the valley northward past the ford;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men were chasing ponies every place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While many others ran, as in a race,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To southward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Hohay, taking to his heels,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made homeward like a cottontail that feels</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A kiote pant and whimper at his tail.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He reached the bluff rim, scrambled to the vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And crossed the stream. The fishermen were gone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hubbub in the village led him on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pell-mell among the snatching underwood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, checked as by a wall of sound, he stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Apant and dripping in the howling town.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A bent old man there hobbled up and down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a staff and sang a cackling song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of how his heart was young again and strong;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But no one heeded. Women ran with guns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bows and war clubs, screaming for their sons</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And husbands. Men were mounting in a whirl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of manes and tales to vanish in a swirl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of scattered sand; and ever louder blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The singing wind of warriors riding through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To battle. Hohay watched them, mouth agape,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until he felt a hand upon his nape</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shoved him north, and someone shouted “<em>Run!</em>”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He scampered.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Meanwhile, nearer to the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A rifle shot beyond the village end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came Reno’s troopers pouring round a bend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their carbines ready at their saddle bows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bugle yammered and a big dust rose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horses nickered as the fours swung wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In battle order; and the captains cried,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a running thunder of hurrahs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long line stormed upon the Hunkpapas</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strung thin across the open flat. They fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like feeble ghosts of men already dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the iron feet that followed there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now they deemed the far-famed Yellow Hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Wolf of Washita, with all his pack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Potential in the dust cloud at his back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bore down upon them.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Flame along a slough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before a howling wind, the terror grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As momently increased the flying mass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all the others running up were grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that flame; till men became aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of how another voice was booming there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outsoaring Panic’s, smashing through the brawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hoofs and wind and rifles.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">It was Gall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A night wind blowing when the stars are dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His big black gelding panted under him;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarce he seemed a man of mortal race,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His naked body and his massive face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serene as hewn from time-forgotten rock,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite the horse’s rearing to the shock</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of surging men. Boy-hearted warriors took</span>
						<br/>
						<span>New courage from the father in his look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And listened in a sudden lull of sound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The foe is there!” he shouted. “Turn around!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Die here today!” And everywhere he rode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A suck of men grew after him and flowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To foeward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Now it seemed the routed fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had joined the halted troops. They ceased to cheer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dismounting with their right upon the trees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the river, and the Rickarees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon their left, they flung a blazing dam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the valley. Like a river jam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The eager rabble deepened on the front,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For other hundreds, howling to the hunt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were dashing up with ponies. Then they say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sound was heard as when a jam gives way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before a heaped up freshet of the Spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ponies in a torrent smote the wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, mounted yet, the little Ree band stood.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now those, remembering where life was good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Regretting that they ever chose to roam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So far from kindly faces, started home</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without farewells; and round the crumpled flank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sioux came thronging, bending back the rank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the pivot of the farther troop,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till, crowded in a brushy river loup,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers fought bewildered and forlorn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind them from across the Little Horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long range rifles on the bluff rim spat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hornet swarm among them; and the flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before them swam with ponies on the run⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A vertigo of shadows; for the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went moony in the dust and disappeared.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inverted faces of a nightmare leered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the necks of ponies hurtling past;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And every surge of horsemen seemed the last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So well their daring fed upon their rage.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It might have been a moment or an age</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troopers gripped that slipping edge of life,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When some along the left saw Bloody Knife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Reno, straighten from his fighting squat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heard him scream, and saw the wound he got</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spew brains between the fingers clutching there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then like a drowning man with hands in air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sank. And some who fought nearby have said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Major’s face, all spattered with the red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that snuffed life, went chalky, and his shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce reached the nearer troopers round about:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>Back to the bluffs!</em>” But when a few arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To do his will, they say he raged at those:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>Get down! Get down!</em>” Then once again he cried:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>Get to the bluffs!</em>”⁠—And was the first to ride.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now some along the right, who had not heard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But saw the mounting, passed a shouted word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That groped, a whisper, through the roaring smoke:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“We’re going to charge!” And where it fell, it broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ragged line. Men scrambled to the rear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where now the plunging horses shrieked with fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fought their holding “fours”⁠—nor all in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For whole quadrigae, fastened bit to rein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ramped down that stormy twilight of the Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nearest empty saddle seat would do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For any lucky finder. Rout or charge⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What matter? All along the river marge</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The man storm raged, and all the darkened vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was tumult. To retreat was to assail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assault was flight. The craven and the bold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed one that moment where the loud dust rolled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Death-strewing, up along the Little Horn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>About the loup a mockery of morn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Broke in upon the gloaming of the noon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horseless troopers, starting from the swoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of battle, saw, and knew themselves alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And heard the wounded wailing and the moan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dying men around them. Even these,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forlorn among the bullet-bitten trees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were scarce less lucky than the fleeing ranks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With crowding furies snapping at their flanks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Death in the rear and frantic hope ahead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas like a bison hunt, the Sioux have said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When few bulls battle and the fat cows run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less fleet than slaughter. Hidden from the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many a boy, struck motherless, belied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whiskered cheek; what heroism died,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fronting the wild white glory!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Funk or fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lost in the noon’s anomaly of night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troopers struggled, groping for a ford.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But more and more the pressure of the horde</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bore leftward, till the steep-banked river spread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before them, and the bluffs that loomed ahead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were like the domes of heaven to the damned.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shrinking moment, and the flood was jammed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With men and horses thrashing belly deep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And down upon them, jostled to the leap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rear cascaded. Many-noted pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sang medley in the roaring rifle rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That swept the jetting water, gust on gust.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a Sioux, gone wild with slaughter lust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Plunged after. Madmen grappled in the flood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tumbling in the current, streaked with blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drank deep together and were satisfied.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now scrambling out upon the further side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hunted troopers blundered at a steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More suited to the flight of mountain sheep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than horses; for a narrow pony trail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That clambered up a gully from the vale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Immediately clogged with brutes and men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spent horses skittered back to strive again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Red-flanked and broken-hearted. Many bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their riders where no horse had gone before,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor ever shall go. Bullets raked the slope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the valley to the heights of hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The air was dirty with the arrow-snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The heights of hope? Alas, that stair of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strewn with the bleeding offal of the rout,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Led only to an eminence of doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A more appalling vision of their plight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For in the rear and on the left and right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nearer bluffs were filling with the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still along the flat beneath them blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dust of thousands yelping for the kill.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They say that good men broke upon the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wept as children weep. And there were some</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who stared about them empty eyed and dumb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though it didn’t matter. Others hurled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Profane irrelevancies at the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or raved about the jamming of their guns.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet there lacked not level-headed ones,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unruffled shepherds of the flock, who strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For order in the milling of the drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With words to soothe or cheer, or sting with scorn.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now up the valley of the Little Horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wild news came crying from the lower town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of other soldiers yonder riding down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the guardless village from the east;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And every tongue that sped the news increased</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The meaning of it. Victory forsook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Big hearts that withered. Lo, the Gray Fox, Crook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Returning for revenge⁠—and not alone!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many camps along the Yellowstone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were emptied on the valley there below?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whipped were but a sprinkle of the foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the torrent was about to burst!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With everything to know, they knew the worst,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw the clearer in that no one saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then broke a flying area of awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the rabble like a patch of sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the troubled corn when gray clouds run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the midst a glowing rift is blown.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pressed back before the plunging white-faced roan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Crazy Horse, men brightened. How they knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lean, swift fighting-spirit of the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wizard eyes, the haggard face and thin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transfigured by a burning from within</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despite the sweat-streaked paint and battle grime!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old men would ponder in the wane of time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lifting vision and alluring cry:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>There never was a better day to die!</em></span>
						<br/>
						<span><em>Come on, Dakotas! Cowards to the rear!</em>”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Some hundreds yonder held the net of fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Round Reno’s hill; but in the cloud that spread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the valley where the fleet roan led</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were thousands.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Now the feeble and the young,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mothers and the maidens, terror-flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the lower village to the west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had seen the soldiers loom along a crest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the town, and, heading down a swale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By fours, with guidons streaming in the gale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Approach the ford. ’Twas Custer with the grays,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sorrel troop and thrice as many bays⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two hundred and a handful at the most;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But ’twas the bannered onset of a host</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To those who saw and fled. Nor could they know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The numbers and the valiance of the foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down river where the bulls of war were loud;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For even then that thunder and the cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came northward. Were they beaten? Had they won?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What devastation, darkening the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was tearing down the valley? On it roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And darkled; deepened at the lower ford</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And veered cyclonic up the yawning draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eastward. Now the breathless people saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dusty ponies darting from the van</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swarming up the left. The guns began,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A running splutter. Yonder to the south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The big dust boiling at a coulee’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was pouring ponies up around the right.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown dimmer in the falling battle-night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stormy guidons of the troopers tossed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retreating upward, lessened and were lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid a whirling cloud that topped the hill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And steadily the valley spouted still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The double stream of warriors.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Then a shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enringed the battle, and the scene went out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In rumbling dust⁠—as though a mine were lit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the summit and the belch of it</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gloomed bellowing. A windy gloaming spread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the ridges flicked with errant lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wayward arrows groping for a mark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horses, hurtled from the central dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With empty saddles charged upon the day.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Meanwhile on Reno’s hill four miles away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men heartened to a rousing cheer had seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bays and blacks and sorrels of Benteen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hoof-heavy with their unavailing quest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the valleys to the south and west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Toil upward. Unmolested by the foe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pack mules, trumpeting “We told you so,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trudged in a little later. By the cheers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It might have been reunion after years;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was in truth; for there were graying locks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That night, to mock the pedantry of clocks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Untroubled by the ages life can pack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between the ticks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">The fire had fallen slack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the watching summits round about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a maze of wonderment and doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men scanned the north that darkled as with war.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“What was it that the Major waited for?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d best be doing something pretty quick</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or there’d be Custer with a pointed stick</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To look for him!” So growled a bolder few.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But many thought of little else to do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than just to dodge the leaden wasp that kills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sent over by the snipers on the hills</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In fitful swarms.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Now like a bellowed word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The miles made inarticulate, they heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sound of volley-firing. <em>There! and there!</em></span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hoarse with a yet incredible despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That incoherent cry of kin to kin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew big above the distant battle din⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sequent breakers of a moaning sea.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And twice the murmuring veil of mystery</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was rent and mended. Then the tearing drawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was heard no more where Fury, striding tall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made one in dust the heavens and the earth.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“He’s pitching into them for all he’s worth,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some ventured;⁠—“was there nothing else to do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But hug that hill?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Then suddenly there grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A voice of wrath, and many lying near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who heard it, looked⁠—and it was Captain Wier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By Reno yonder; and the place went still:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Then, Major, if you won’t, by God I will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there’ll be more to say if we get back!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw him fling a leg across his black</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And take the northward steep with face set grim;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the black horse troop rode after him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the gulch to vanish on a rise.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Two miles away from where the smudgy skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of afternoon anticipated night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They halted on a space-commanding height</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, squinting through the dusty air ahead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were puzzled. For the silence of the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fallen yonder⁠—only now and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A few shots crackled. Groups of mounted men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not troopers⁠—by the rifting dust revealed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were scattered motionless about the field,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As wearily contented with a work</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well done at last.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Then suddenly the murk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to boil and murmur, like a storm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the wind comes. Ponies in a swarm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were spreading out across the ridgy land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the blacks.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">By now the whole command</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was coming up, and not a whit too soon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For once again the sun became a moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the dust of thousands bearing down.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now farther back upon a bleak bluff crown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troop of Godfrey waited for the fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not doubting that their comrades held the right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When orders, riding with an urgent heel,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arrived with more of prudence to reveal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than pluck: <em>Withdraw at once!</em> A startled stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made plain how all the flanking hills were bare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not a sign of Reno in the rear!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just then the fleeing troops of French and Wier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came roaring down across a ridge in front</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, close upon their heels, the howling hunt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made dimmer yet the summit of the slope.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Godfrey, seeing very little hope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If all should flee those thousands, overjoyed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With some great coup, dismounted and deployed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fight on foot, and sent the horses back.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so he dared the brunt of the attack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retreating slowly like a wounded bear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With yelping dogs before him everywhere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Regardful of the eager might at bay.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so the whole command got back that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of big despairs; and men remember still.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then all the ridges circling Reno’s hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were crowded. In among the flattened men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now desperately fighting one to ten,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hell hornets snarled and feathered furies crooned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A death song; and the sun was like a wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherewith the day bled dizzy. Yet from all</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The muddled nightmare of it, men recall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deeds brighter for the years: how Captain French,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like any stodgy tailor on his bench,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sat cross-legged at the giddy edge of life</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely picking with a pocket knife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shell-jammed guns and loading them anew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How, seemingly enamoured of the view,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deliberate, Johnsonian of mien,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His briar drawing freely, strolled Benteen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along his fighting line; how Wallace, Wier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Godfrey yonder, fearing only fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Walked round among the troopers, cheering them.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some remember Happy Jack of M,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way his gusty laughter served to melt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The frost of terror, though the joy he felt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed less to mark a hero than a fool.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once, they say, an ammunition mule</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Broke loose and bolted, braying, as he went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defiance and a traitorous intent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To quit the Whites forever. Then they tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Sergeant Hanley with an Irish yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Took horse and followed, jealous for the pack;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the line roared after him, “Come back!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Come back, you fool!” But Hanley went ahead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At times you hardly saw him for the lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That whipped the dust up. Blindly resolute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The traitor with the Irish in pursuit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Struck up along a hostile ridge that burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And smoked and bellowed. Presently he turned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And panted home, an image of remorse;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Hanley, leaping from his winded horse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay down and went to work among the rest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The wounded day bled ashen in the west;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The firing dwindled in the dusk and ceased;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The frightened stars came peeking from the east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see what anguish moaned. The wind went down⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lull of death. But yonder in the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All night the war drums flouted that despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the hill, and dancers in the glare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fires that towered filled the painted dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With demon exultation, till the lark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of doom should warble. Heavy-lidded eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw often in the sage along a rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The loom of troops. If any shouted “Look!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pointed, all the others cheered for Crook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or Terry coming; and the bugles cried</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mocking echoes. When the sick hope died,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They fell to sullen labor, scraping up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The arid earth with plate and drinking cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the dreaded breaking of the day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And here and there among the toilers lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The winners of an endless right to shirk;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While many panted at a harder work,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wage whereof is nothing left to buy.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It seemed that all were men about to die,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forlornly busy there among the dead⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each man his sexton. Petulant with dread,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They talked of Custer, grumbling at a name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already shaping on the lips of Fame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be a deathless bugle-singing soon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For no one guessed what now the tardy moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was poring over with a face of fright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out yonder: naked bodies gleaming white</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole way to the summit of the steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Silence, brooding on a tumbled heap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of men and horses, listened for a sound.⁠ ⁠…</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wounded troop horse sniffed the bloody ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ghosts of horses nickered when he neighed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now scarcely had the prairie owls, afraid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of morning, ceased, or waiting hushes heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A timid, unauthoritative bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Complain how late the meadowlarks awoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When suddenly the dreaded fury broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the sleepless troopers, digging still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It raked the shallow trenches on the hill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It beat upon the little hollow where</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mules and horses, tethered in a square</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the wounded, roared and plunged amain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tight-tailed against no pasture-loving rain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many fell and floundered. What of night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From such a morning? For the hostile light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Increased the fury, and the battle grew.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That day it seemed the very sun was Sioux.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The heat, the frenzy and the powder gas</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wreaked torture. Men were chewing roots of grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For comfort ere the day had well begun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bare to the grim mid-malice of the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wounded raved for water. Far below,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cool with the melting of the mountain snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The river gleamed; and, queasy with the smell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bodies bloating in a stew of hell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men croaked about it. Better to be killed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half way to yonder joy than perish grilled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between that grid of earth and burning air!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So nineteen troopers volunteered to dare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A grisly race. The twentieth who ran,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invisible and fleeter than a man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hoofs of peril flicked the dusty sod</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where pluckily the sprinting water squad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made streamward. Giddy with a wound he got,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A trooper tumbled, and his cooking pot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursued the others with a bounding roll.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A second runner crumpled near the goal.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the sprawling winners drank, they say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bullets whipped the water into spray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About their heads; for yonder in the brush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sioux kept watch, but dared not make a rush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because of marksmen stationed on the bluff.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the greedy drinkers had enough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With brimming kettles and the filled canteens</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They toiled along the tortuous ravines</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And panted up a height that wasn’t Fame’s.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men still recall the water; but the names</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enrich that silence where the millions go.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The shadows had begun to overflow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their stagnant puddles on the nightward side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When presently the roar of battle died</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On all the circling summits there. Perplexed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With what the wily foe might purpose next,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The troopers lay and waited. Still the swoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of silence held the stifling afternoon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save for a low monotony of pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The keening of the gnats about the slain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That festered. Nothing happened. Shadows crept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little farther nightward. Many slept,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dead to the sergeant’s monitory shake;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some, for very weariness awake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Got up and dared to stretch a leg at last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When from the summits broke a rifle blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That banished sleep and drove the strollers in.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Abruptly as it started, ceased the din</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the hills seemed empty as before.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And, breath by breath, the weary waiting wore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hours out. Every minute, loath to pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forewarned the next of some assault in mass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Preparing in the hush. A careless head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above a horse’s carcass drew the lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of lurking marksmen. What would be the end?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prayed-for dark itself might prove no friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all its pity.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Now the early slant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of evening made the thirsty horses pant</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And raise a running whimper of despair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, seemingly ignited by the glare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The very prairie smouldered. Spire by spire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the whole fat valley was afire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smoke towered in the windless air and grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where late the league long village of the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay hidden from the watchers on the hill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like the shadow of a monster ill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Untimely gloaming fell across the height.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet nothing but the failing of the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the distant summits came to pass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The muffled murmur of the burning grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was all the reeking valley had of sound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the troopers dared to walk around,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No spluttering of rifles drove them back.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The shadows in the draws were getting black</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When someone lifted up a joyous cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That set the whole band staring where the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To southward of the smoke, remembered day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there they saw, already miles away⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pictographic scrawl upon the glow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tangled slant and clutter of travaux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By crowding hundreds; ponies that pursued,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crawling, milling, tossing multitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A somber river brawling out of banks;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And glooms of horsemen flowing on the flanks⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole Sioux village fleeing with the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the Big Horn Mountains glimmered white</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And low along the south!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">The horses neighed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To swell the happy noise their masters made.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pack mules sang the only song they knew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And summits, late familiar with the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proclaimed a new allegiance, cheer on cheer.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For who could doubt that news of Terry near</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had driven off the foe?</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i12">Moon wore by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the rainless waning of July</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten thousand hearts were troubled where the creeks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young from the ancient winter of the peaks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Romped in the mountain meadows green as May.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The very children lost the heart to play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awed by the shadow of an unseen thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As covies, when the shadow of a wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forebodes a pounce of terror from the skies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw it in the bravest father’s eyes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shadow⁠—in the gentlest mother’s face;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwitting how there fell upon a race</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The twilight of irreparable wrong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drums had fallen silent with the song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And valiant tales, late eager to be told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were one with all things glorious and old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dear and gone forever from the Sioux.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For now the hunted prairie people knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How powerful the Gray Fox camp had grown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Goose Creek; how along the Yellowstone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mounted soldiers and the walking ones⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A multitude⁠—had got them wagon guns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the voice was thunder and the stroke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far off, a second thunder and a smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That bit and tore. A little while, and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those open jaws, toothed terribly with men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would move together, closing to the bite.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What hope was left in anything but flight?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whither? O the world was narrow now!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>South, east, the rat-like nibbling of the plow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had left them but a little way to go.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mountains of the never melting snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Walled up the west. Beyond the northern haze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There lay a land of unfamiliar ways,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dark tongues and alien eyes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">As waters keep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their wonted channels, yearning for the deep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The homeless rabble took the ancient road.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From bluff to bluff the Rosebud valley flowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their miles of ponies; and the pine-clad heights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were sky-devouring torches in the nights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind them, and a rolling gloom by day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prairies, kindled all along the way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bloomed balefully and blackened. Noon was dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Night starless, and the fleeing meadowlark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forgot the morning. Where the Bluestone runs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their dust bore east; and seldom did the suns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold them going for the seed they strewed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To crop the rearward prairie solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With black starvation even for the crow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Creeks, stricken as with fever, ceased to flow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And languished in a steaming ashen mire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But more than grass was given to the fire⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O memories no spring could render young!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so it was that, marching down the Tongue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Gray Fox, seeking for the hostile bands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw nothing but the desolated lands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black to the sky; and when a dreary week</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had brought him to the mouth of Bluestone Creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lo, Terry with another empty tale!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Broad as a road to ruin ran the trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of driven pony herds, a livid scar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a vast cadaver, winding far</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To eastward as the tallest hill might look.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thither pressed the horse and foot of Crook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their pack mules, lighter for a greater speed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With scant provisions for a fortnight’s need</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon their saddles.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Burning August waned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the toiling regiments. It rained⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sodden, chill monotony of rains⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the elements had cursed the plains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now that flame had stricken, water struck.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scarecrow horses struggled with the suck</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gumbo flats and heartbreak hills of clay;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a bone-bag fell beside the way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too weak to rise, for still the draws were few</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That were not blackened. Crows and buzzards knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How little eager claws and whetted beaks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Availed them where so many hollow cheeks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had bulged about a brief and cookless feast.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Still wearily the main trail lengthened east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By hungry days and fireless bivouacs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And more and more diverging pony tracks,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To north and south, and tangent lodge pole trails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Revealed the hunted scattering as quails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before a dreaded hunter. Eastward still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They staggered, nourished by a doggèd will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past where a little river apes in mud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And name the genius of a titan flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That drinks it. Crumbling pinnacles of awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked down upon them; domes of wonder saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The draggled column slowly making head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the muck; the drooping horses, led,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well loaded with their saddles; empty packs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Become a cruel burden on the backs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of plodding mules with noses to the ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the deeps of Davis Creek they wound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the Camel’s Hump and Rosebud Butte</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>Behold the Heart’s head.</span>
							<span>Here the long pursuit,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, had come to nothing after all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The multitude of Crazy Horse and Gall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had vanished in that God-forsaken place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And matched their fagged pursuers for a race</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With something grimmer than a human foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Four marches east across the dim plateau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fort Lincoln lured them. Twice as many days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the dripping low September haze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Due south across the yet uncharted lands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay Deadwood, unprotected from the bands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of prowling hostiles. ’Twas enough for Crook.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half-heartedly the ragged column took</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>The way of duty.</span>
							<span>And the foe appeared!</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, like a god-built stadium, the tiered</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Age-carven Slim Buttes watch the Rabbit’s Lip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go groping for the ocean, in the drip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ooze of sodden skies the battle raged;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And presences, millennially aged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In primal silence, shouted at the sight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the rifles gashed the front of night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sanguinary wounds, they fought it out;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And darkness was the end of it, and doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And drizzle. Unrejoicing victors knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What enemy, more mighty than the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would follow with no lagging human feet;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And early morning saw them in retreat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that foe. Above their buried slain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand horses trampled in the rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That none might know the consecrated ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To violate it.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Up and up they wound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the foggy summits, till the van</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was checked with awe. Inimical to Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Below them spread a featureless immense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More credibly a dream of impotence</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than any earthly country to be crossed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gloomy flat, illimitably lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In gauzes of the downpour.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Thither strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gaunt battalions. And the chill rain drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unceasingly. Through league on league of mire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men straggled into camps without a fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wolf their slaughtered horses in the red;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the wallow of the way they fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was strewn with crowbaits dying in the bogs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About them in the forest of the fogs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lurked Crazy Horse, a cougar mad for blood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scarce the rearguard-battles in the mud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused the sullen plodders to the fore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Deer’s Ears loomed and vanished in the pour;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Haystack Buttes stole off along the right;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men grew old between a night and night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before their feeble toil availed to raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Black Hills, set against the evil days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a paradise of food and rest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Crazy Horse’s people, turning west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Retraced the trail of ruin, sick for home.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where myriads of the bison used to roam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fatten in the golden autumn drowse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A few rejected bulls and barren cows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew yet a little leaner. Every place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The good old earth, with ashes on her face,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a childless mother in despair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though still she kept with jealous, loving care</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some little hoard of all her youth had known</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the dear returning of her own;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But where the starving herd of ponies passed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little shielded hollows, lately grassed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were stricken barren even as with fire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so they reached the place of their desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deep-carved valley where the Powder flows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here surely there was peace.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">But when the snows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came booming where the huddled village stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ponies, lean with gnawing cottonwood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were slain to fill the kettles, Dull Knife came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The great Cheyenne. The same⁠—O not the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As he who fought beside the Greasy Grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And slew his fill of enemies! Alas,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The beggar in his eyes! And very old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed, for hunger and the pinch of cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were on him; and the rabble at his back⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Despairing hundreds⁠—lacked not any lack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That flesh may know and live. The feeble wail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of babies put an edge upon the tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Dull Knife told.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">“There was a fight,” he said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I set my winter village at the head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Willow Creek. The mountains there are tall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A canyon stood about me for a wall;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And it was good to hear my people sing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there was none that wanted anything</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That makes men happy. We were all asleep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cold was sharp; the snow was very deep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What enemy could find us? We awoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thunder and a shouting and a smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were there among us, and a swarm of foes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pawnees, Shoshones and Arapahoes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And soldiers, many soldiers. It was night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About us, and we fought them in the light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of burning lodges till the town was lost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all our plenty. Bitter was the frost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And most of us were naked from the bed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now many of our little ones are dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cold and hunger. Shall the others die?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>There was a light in Crazy Horse’s eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like moony ice. The other spoke again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“As brothers have Dakota and Cheyenne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made war together. Help us. You have seen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>We can not live until the grass is green,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>My brother!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">Then the other face grew stone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hard lips moved: “A man must feed his own,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Said Crazy Horse, and turned upon his heel.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now the flint of him had found the steel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Dull Knife, and the flare was bad to see.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Tashunka Witko, dare to look at me</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That you may not forget me. We shall meet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers yonder have enough to eat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I will come, no beggar, with the grass!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And silently the people saw him pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the valley where the snow lay blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The plodding, silent, ragamuffin crew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind him. So the evil days began.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Crazy Horse, they say, was like a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, having seen a ghost, must look and look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brood upon the empty way it took</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To nowhere; and he scarcely ate at all;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was that about him like a wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shut men out. He seemed no longer young.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Bleak January found them on the Tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In search of better forage for the herd⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A failing quest. And hither came the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of many walking soldiers coming down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With wagon guns upon the starving town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That might not flee; for whither could they go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With ponies pawing feebly in the snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To grow the leaner? Mighty in despair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They waited on a lofty summit there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the valley.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Raw gray dawn revealed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A scaly serpent crawling up a field</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of white beneath them. Leisurely it neared,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resolving into men of frosty beard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sloping rifles swinging to the beat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And melancholy fifing of their feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the frost; and shrill the wagon tires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sang rearward. Now the soldiers lighted fires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had their breakfast hot, as who should say:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“What hurry? It is early in the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there is time for what we came to do.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With wistful eyes the rabble of the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld the eating; knew that they defied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain their own misgivings when they cried:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Eat plenty! You will never eat again!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was not so; for those were devil men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who needed nothing and were hard to kill.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The wagon-guns barked sharply at the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bite the summit, always shooting twice;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scrambling upward through the snow and ice</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came doggedly, without a sign of fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The infantry of Miles. They didn’t cheer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They didn’t hurry, and they didn’t stop,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For all the rifles roaring at the top,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the gun-butt met the battle-ax.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still fighting with their children at their backs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Sioux gave slowly. Wind came on to blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hurrying northwester, blind with snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the wild white dusk of it they fled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when they reached the Little Powder’s head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So much of all their little had been lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So well had wrought their hunger and the frost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One might have thought ’twas Dull Knife coming there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The country had a cold, disowning stare;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The burned-off valleys could not feed their own.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The moon was like a frozen bubble, blown</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the rim of February nights,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Spotted Tail, the lover of the Whites,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came there with mighty words. His cheeks were full,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His belly round. He spoke of Sitting Bull</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Gall defeated, driven far away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the line; of Red Cloud getting gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before his time⁠—a cougar in a cage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Self-eaten by a silent, toothless rage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That only made the watching sentry smile.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the story saddened. All the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scattered Sioux were coming in to save</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their children with the food the soldiers gave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And laying down their guns and making peace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He told how Dull Knife’s fury did not cease</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But grew upon the soldier food he ate;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how his people fattened, nursing hate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Crazy Horse. And many more than these</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But waited for the grass⁠—the Loup Pawnees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Utes, the Winnebagoes and the Crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shoshones, Bannocks and Arapahoes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With very many more Dakotas too!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>“Now what could Crazy Horse’s people do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against them all?” said Spotted Tail, the Wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with the ancient puzzle in his eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That only death may riddle; gazing long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now first upon the fat one in the wrong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now upon the starving in the right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other found an answer: “I could fight!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I could fight till all of us were dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now I have no powder left,” he said;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I can not fight. Tell Gray Fox what you saw;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That I am only waiting for a thaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bring my people in.”</span>

						<p epub:type="title">The Death of Crazy Horse</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">And now ’twas done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spring found the waiting fort at Robinson</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A half-moon ere the Little Powder knew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, doubting still what Crazy Horse might do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When tempted by the herald geese a-wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To join the green rebellion of the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole frontier was troubled. April came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once again his undefeated name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rode every wind. Ingeniously the West</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrought verities from what the East had guessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of what the North knew. Eagerly deceived,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The waiting South progressively believed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wilder story. April wore away;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fleet couriers, arriving day by day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With but the farthing mintage of the fact,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bought credit slowly in that no one lacked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The easy gold of marvelous surmise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, gazing northward where the secret skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were moody with a coming long deferred,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whoever spoke of Crazy Horse, still heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ten thousand hoofs.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">But yonder, with the crow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kiote to applaud his pomp of woe,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last great Sioux rode down to his defeat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now his people huddled in the sleet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Dog Creek and the Little Powder met.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With faces ever sharper for the whet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of hunger, silent in the driving rains,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They straggled out across the blackened plains</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where Inyan Kara, mystically old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drew back a cloudy curtain to behold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serene with Time’s indifference to men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now they tarried on the North Cheyenne</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To graze their feeble ponies, for the news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of April there had wakened in the sloughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A glimmering of pity long denied.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor would their trail across the bare divide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grow dimmer with the summer, for the bleach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dwindled herds⁠—so hard it was to reach</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The South Cheyenne. O sad it was to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How all the pent-up music of the year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Surged northward there the way it used to do!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain the catbird scolded at the Sioux;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The timid pewee queried them in vain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor might they harken to the whooping crane</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor heed the high geese calling them to come.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwelcome waifs of winter, drab and dumb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where ecstasy of sap and thrill of wing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made shift to flaunt some color or to sing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The birth of joy, they toiled a weary way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And giddy April sobered into May</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before they topped the summit looking down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the valley of the soldier’s town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Robinson.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Then eerily began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the lean-jowled warriors in the van</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chant of peace, a supplicating wail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That spread along the clutter of the trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the last bent straggler sang alone;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And camp dogs, hunger-bitten to the bone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Accused the heavens with a doleful sound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, silent still, with noses to the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The laden ponies toiled to cheat the crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And famine, like a wag, had made of those</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>A grisly jest.</span>
							<span>So Crazy Horse came in</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>With twice a thousand beggars.</span>
							<span>And the din</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Died out, though here and there a dog still howled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now the mighty one, whom Fate had fouled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dismounted, faced the silent double row</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of soldiers haughty with the glint and glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of steel and brass. A little while he stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though bewildered in a haunted wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of men and rifles all astare with eyes.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw a giant shrunken to the size</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of any sergeant. Now he met the glare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Dull Knife and his warriors waiting there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fingers itching at the trigger-guard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many comrade faces, strangely hard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were turned upon him! Ruefully he smiled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The doubtful supplication of a child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Caught guilty; loosed the bonnet from his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cast it down. “I come for peace,” he said;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Now let my people eat.” And that was all.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The summer ripened. Presages of fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now wanted nothing but the goose’s flight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The goldenrods had made their torches bright</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the ghostly imminence of frost.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one, long brooding on a birthright lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembered and remembered. O the time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When all the prairie world was white with rime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mornings, and the lodge smoke towered straight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet the sunlight, coming over late</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For happy hunting! O the days, the days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When winds kept silence in the far blue haze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hear the deep-grassed valleys running full</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With fading cows, and thunders of the bull</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the hills! Nights given to the feast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When big round moons came smiling up the east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To listen to the drums, the dancing feet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The voices of the women, high and sweet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the men’s!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">And Crazy Horse was sad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There wasn’t any food the white man had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could find his gnawing hunger and assuage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some saw a blood-mad panther in a cage,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some the sulking of a foolish pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For there were those who watched him narrow-eyed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole day long and listened for a word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shuttle in the warp of what they heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A woof of darker meaning.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Then one day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flying tale of battles far away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And deeds to make men wonder stirred the land:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Nez Perce Joseph led his little band,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Howard’s eager squadrons in pursuit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the mountains of the Bitter Root</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Big Hole Basin and the daylong fight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how his women, fleeing in the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought off the ponies and the children too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O many a heart beat fast among the Sioux</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hear the way he fled and fought and fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Past Bannack, down across the Beaverhead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Henry’s Lake, relentlessly pursued;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now swallowed by the dreadful solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where still the Mighty Spirit shapes the dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With primal fires and prodigies of steam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when the fallow night was newly sown;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now reappearing down the Yellowstone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Undaunted yet and ever making less</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thousand miles of alien wilderness</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between a people’s freedom and their need!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O there was virtue in the tale to feed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The withered heart and make it big again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not yet, not yet the ancient breed of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had vanished from the aging earth! They say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came a change on Crazy Horse the day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Ogalala village buzzed the news.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So much to win and only life to lose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bison making southward with the fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Joseph fighting up the way to Gall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Sitting Bull!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Who knows the dream he had?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Much talk there was of how his heart was bad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And any day some meditated deed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might start an irresistible stampede</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Sioux⁠—a human prairie-fire!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So back and forth along the talking wire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fear chattered. Yonder, far away as morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The mighty heard⁠—and heard the Little Horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still roaring with the wind of Custer’s doom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there were troopers moving in the gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of midnight to the chaining of the beast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the white light broke along the east,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There wasn’t any Ogalala town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Crazy Horse had vanished!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">Up and down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dusty autumn panic horsemen spurred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till all the border shuddered at the word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of how that terror threatened every trail.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They found him in the camp of Spotted Tail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lonely figure with a face of care.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I am afraid of what might happen there”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He said. “So many listen what I say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And look and look. I will not run away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I want my people here. You have my guns.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But half a world away the mighty ones</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had spoken words like bullets in the dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That wreak the rage of blindness on a mark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They can not know.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Then spoke the one who led</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldiers: “Not a hair upon your head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shall suffer any harm if you will go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Robinson for just a day or so</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And have a parley with the soldier chief.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He spoke believing and he won belief,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Crazy Horse went riding down the west;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And neither he nor any trooper guessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What doom now made a rutted wagon road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The highway to a happier abode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where all the dead are splendidly alive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And summer lingers and the bison thrive</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forever.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i5">If the better hope be true,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was a gate of glory yawning through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sunset when the little cavalcade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Approached the fort.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">The populous parade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The straining hush that somehow wasn’t peace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bristling troops, the Indian police</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drawn up as for a battle! What was wrong?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What made them hustle Crazy Horse along</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the gleaming bayonets and eyes?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There swept a look of quizzical surprise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across his face. He struggled with the guard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their grips were steel; their eyes were cold and hard⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like bayonets.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">There was a door flung wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The soldier chief would talk with him inside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all be well at last!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">The stifling, dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Interior poured terror over him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He blinked about⁠—and saw the iron bars.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O nevermore to neighbor with the stars</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or know the simple goodness of the sun!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did some swift vision of a doom begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Reveal the monstrous purpose of a lie⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The desert island and the alien sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long and lonely ebbing of a life?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The glimmer of a whipped-out butcher knife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dismayed the shrinking squad, and once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men saw a face that many better men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had died to see! Brown arms that once were kind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A comrade’s arms, whipped round him from behind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went crimson with a gash and dropped aside.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Don’t touch me! I am Crazy Horse!” he cried,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, leaping doorward, charged upon the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet the end. A frightened soldier hurled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His weight behind a jabbing belly-thrust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Crazy Horse plunged headlong in the dust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A writhing heap. The momentary din</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of struggle ceased. The people, closing in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went ominously silent for a space,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And one could hear men breathing round the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where lay the mighty. Now he strove to rise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wide blind stare of anguish in his eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And someone shouted “<em>Kill that devil quick!</em>”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A throaty murmur and a running click</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gun-locks woke among the crowding Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many a soldier whitened. Well they knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What pent-up hate the moment might release</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To drop upon the bungled farce of peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bloody curtain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">One began to talk;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His tongue was drunken and his face was chalk;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when a half-breed shouted what he spoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crowd believed, so few had seen the stroke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was there any bleeding of the wound.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the chief had falleasick and swooned;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps a little rest would make him strong!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And silently they watched him borne along,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sagging bundle, dear and mighty yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though from the sharp face, beaded with the sweat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of agony, already peered the ghost.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They laid him in an office of the post,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And soldiers, forming in a hollow square,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held back the people. Silence deepened there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little while it seemed the man was dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He lay so still. The west no longer bled;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the crowd the dusk began to creep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then suddenly, as startled out of sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By some old dream-remembered night alarm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He strove to shout, half rose upon an arm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And glared about him in the lamp-lit place.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The flare across the ashes of his face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went out. He spoke; and, leaning where he lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men strained to gather what he strove to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So hard the panting labor of his words.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I had my village and my pony herds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Powder where the land was all my own.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I only wanted to be let alone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I did not want to fight. The Gray Fox sent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His soldiers. We were poorer when they went;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our babies died, for many lodges burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And it was cold. We hoped again and turned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Our faces westward. It was just the same</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out yonder on the Rosebud. Gray Fox came.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dust his soldiers made was high and long.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I fought him and I whipped him. Was it wrong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To drive him back? That country was my own.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I only wanted to be let alone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I did not want to see my people die.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They say I murdered Long Hair and they lie.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His soldiers came to kill us and they died.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>He choked and shivered, staring hungry-eyed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though to make the most of little light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then like a child that feels the clutching night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cries the wilder, deeming it in vain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He raised a voice made lyrical with pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And terror of a thing about to be.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>I want to see you, Father! Come to me!</em></span>
						<br/>
						<span><em>I want to see you, Mother!</em>” O’er and o’er</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His cry assailed the darkness at the door;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the gloom beyond the hollow square</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of soldiers, quavered voices of despair:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“<em>We can not come! They will not let us come!</em>”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when at length the lyric voice was dumb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Crazy Horse was nothing but a name,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was a little withered woman came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind a bent old man. Their eyes were dim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They sat beside the boy and fondled him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembering the little names he knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the great dream took him and he grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be so mighty. And the woman pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hand that men had feared against her breast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swayed and sang a little sleepy song.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out yonder in the village all night long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was a sound of mourning in the dark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the morning heard the meadowlark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The last great Sioux rode silently away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the pony-drag on which he lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An old man tottered. Bowed above the bier,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little wrinkled woman kept the rear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With not a sound and nothing in her eyes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Who knows the crumbling summit where he lies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alone among the badlands? Kiotes prowl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About it, and the voices of the owl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assume the daylong sorrow of the crows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These many grasses and these many snows.</span>

			<section id="the-song-of-three-friends-preface" epub:type="preface">
				<h3 epub:type="title">Note</h3>
				<p>The following narrative, though complete in itself, is designed to be the first piece in a cycle of poems dealing with the fur trade period of the Trans-Missouri region. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">The Song of Hugh Glass</i>, which was published in the fall of 1915, is the second in the series.</p>
				<p>The four decades during which the fur trade flourished west of the Missouri River may be regarded as a typical heroic period, differing in no essential from the many other great heroic periods that have made glorious the story of the Aryan migration. Jane Harrison says that heroic characters do not arise from any peculiarity of race or even of geographical surroundings; but that, given certain social conditions, they may and do appear anywhere and at any time. The heroic spirit, as seen in heroic poetry, we are told, is the outcome of a society cut loose from its roots, of a time of migrations, of the shifting of populations. Such conditions are to be found during the time of the Spanish conquests of Central and South America; and they are to be found also in those wonderful years of our own West, when wandering bands of trappers were exploring the rivers and the mountains and the plains and the deserts from the British possessions to Mexico, and from the Missouri to the Pacific.</p>
				<p>As a result of our individualistic tendencies, our numerous jostling nationalities, and our materialistic temper, we Americans are prone to regard the Past as being separated from us as by an insurmountable wall. We lack the sense of racial continuity. For us it is almost as though the world began yesterday morning; and too much of our contemporary literature is based upon that view. The affairs of antiquity seem to the generality of us to be as remote as the dimmest star, and as little related to our activities. But what we call the slow lapse of ages is really only the blinking of an eye. Sometimes this sense of the close unity of all time and all human experience has come upon me so strongly that I have felt, for an intense moment, how just a little hurry on my part might get me there in time to hear Aeschylus training a Chorus, or to see the wizard chisel still busy with the Parthenon frieze, or to hear Socrates telling his dreams to his judges. It is in some such mood that I approach that body of precious saga-stuff which I have called the Western American Epos; and I see it, not as a thing in itself, but rather as one phase of the whole race life from the beginning; indeed, the final link in that long chain of heroic periods stretching from the region of the Euphrates eastward into India and westward to our own Pacific Coast.</p>
				<p>Like causes produce like effects; and as we follow the Aryan migration, we find that, over and over again, heroic periods occur; and out of each period have grown epic and saga, celebrating the deeds of the heroes. In India we find the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Mahabharata</i> and <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ramayana</i>; in Persia, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Shah Nameh</i>; among the Greeks, the Homeric poems; in Rome, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Aeneid</i>; in Germany, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Niebelungenlied</i>; in France, the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="fr">Chanson de Roland</i>; in the Scandinavian countries, the sagas and the Eddaic poems; in the British Isles, the Arthurian and Cuchulain cycles. The Race crosses the Atlantic, and the last lap of the long westward journey is begun. Still another typical heroic period develops; and where shall we find its epic? Certainly not in Hiawatha, which is not concerned with our race, and but little with the real American Indian, for that matter. Certainly not in Evangeline, which is typical neither in matter nor manner. Nor is it likely ever to be written on a theme concerned with the original Colonies, for the reason that in the Colonies society was never cut loose from its roots. The true American Epos was developed between the Missouri River and the Pacific Ocean in approximately the first four decades of the 19th century. When the settlers began to cross the Missouri, the end of the epic period was in sight.</p>
				<p>As has been the case with all similar periods, a great body of legend, concerned with heroic deeds, grew up about those men who explored that vast wilderness in search of furs. These stories, which formerly circulated throughout the West as oral tradition, are now, in the main, known only to specialists in Western history; for they are to be found chiefly in contemporary journals and books of travel long since out of print and difficult to obtain. Anyone who has taken the trouble to explore that spacious and comparatively little known field of American history will be likely to believe with me that the heroes of that time were the direct descendants, in the epic line, of all the heroes of the race that have been celebrated in song and saga.</p>
				<p>It would seem that we are now entering upon a period in which such a work as I propose might logically be written, if we are to accept the theory of George Edward Woodberry. He tells us that those literary works which embody representative epochs appear upon what he terms “watersheds of history”; that is to say, at those times when an old order is passing away, when men look forward hopefully or fearfully to new things, and backward a little wistfully to things that have been. That is the state of the modern world. We are experiencing the wane of individualism; we are beginning to think in terms of the group; and already reactionary voices are being raised in defence of the good old days when a man could do as it pleased him to do. And if we seek for that moment in our national life when individualism was most pronounced, we shall find it in the romantic period with which I am concerned; for in that time society did not exist in the Trans-Missouri country, and there was no law but the whim of the daring and the strong.</p>
				<p>Obviously, in attempting to embody such a period in a literary work, it is necessary to concentrate upon one representative portion of it. Fortunately, this can be done without sacrifice and without resorting to fictitious means. The story of the two expeditions that ascended the Missouri River under the leadership of Ashley and Henry of <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis in the years 1822 and 1823, comprehends every phase of the life of the epoch and covers the entire Trans-Missouri region from the British boundaries to Santa Fe, and from <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis to the Spanish Settlements of California. Furthermore, of all the bands of trappers and traders that entered the wilderness during those years, none experienced so many extraordinary adventures as did the Ashley-Henry men. The story of their exploits and wanderings constitutes what I would call the Ashley-Henry Saga; and it is upon this that I am basing my cycle.</p>
				<p>The first printed version of the present story is to be found in the files of a short-lived periodical known as <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Western Souvenir</i>, from which it was copied by the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">Western Monthly Review</i> for July, 1829. <i epub:type="se:name.publication.newspaper">The Missouri Intelligencer</i> for September 4, 1829, and Howe’s “Historical Collections of the Great West” contain practically the same version of the tale. A matter-of-fact reference to the episode is made on page 298 of the Letter Book of the Superintendent of Indian Affairs, now among the manuscripts of the Kansas Historical Society at Topeka.</p>
				<p>I wish to express a sense of obligation to <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Doane Robinson, Secretary of the State Historical Society of South Dakota, for placing his wide knowledge of Western history at my disposal.</p>

					<p>
						<span>Who now reads clear the roster of that band?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alas, Time scribbles with a careless hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And often pinchbeck doings from that pen</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bite deep, where deeds and dooms of mighty men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are blotted out beneath a sordid scrawl!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One hundred strong they flocked to Ashley’s call</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That spring of eighteen hundred twenty-two;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For tales of wealth, out-legending Peru,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came wind-blown from Missouri’s distant springs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And that old sireny of unknown things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bewitched them, and they could not linger more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard the song the sea winds sang the shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When earth was flat, and black ships dared the steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where bloomed the purple perils of the deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In dragon-haunted gardens. They were young.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Albeit some might feel the winter flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon their heads, ’twas less like autumn’s drift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than backward April’s unregarded sift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On stout oaks thrilling with the sap again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some had scarce attained the height of men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their lips unroughed, and gleaming in their eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The light of immemorial surprise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That life still kept the spaciousness of old</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like the hoarded tales their grandsires told,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might still run bravely.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">For a little span</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their life-fires flared like torches in the van</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of westward progress, ere the great wind ’woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To snuff them. Many vanished like a smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blue air drinks; and e’en of those who burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Down to the socket, scarce a tithe returned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share at last the ways of quiet men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or see the hearth-reek drifting once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the roofs of old <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis town.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now no more the mackinaws come down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their gunwales low with costly packs and bales,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wind of wonder in their shabby sails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their homing oars flung rhythmic to the tide;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nevermore the masted keelboats ride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Missouri’s stubborn waters on the lone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Long zigzag journey to the Yellowstone.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their hulks have found the harbor ways that know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ships of all the Sagas, long ago⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moony haven where no loud gale stirs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trappers and the singing voyageurs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Are comrades now of Jason and his crew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foregathered in that timeless rendezvous</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where come at last all seekers of the Fleece.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Not now of those who, dying, dropped in peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A brimming cup of years the song shall be:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Mississippi to the Western Sea,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From Britain’s country to the Rio Grande</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their names are written deep across the land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In pass and trail and river, like a rune.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Pore long upon that roster by the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of things remembered dimly. Tangled, blear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The writing runs; yet presently appear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three names of men that, spoken, somehow seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Incantatory trumpets of a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Obscurely blowing from the hinter-gloom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of these and that inexorable doom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That followed like a hound upon the scent,</span>

						<span>Here runs the tale.</span>

						<br/>
						<span>Like panic bugles. Up the gangplanks poured,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go streams of trappers, rushing goods aboard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snub-built keelboats, squat with seeming sloth⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Baled three-point blankets, blue and scarlet cloth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rum, powder, flour, guns, gauderies and lead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all about, goodbyes are being said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gauche girls with rainy April in their gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cling to their beardless heroes, count the days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between this parting and the wedding morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwitting how unhuman Fate may scorn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The youngling dream. For O how many a lad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would see the face of Danger, and go mad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With her weird vixen beauty; aye, forget</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This girl’s face, yearning upward now and wet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half woman’s with the first vague guess at woe!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now commands are bellowed, boat horns blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Haughtily in the dawn; the tumult swells.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tow-crews, shouldering the long cordelles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slack from the mastheads, lean upon the sag.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The keelboats answer lazily and drag</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their blunt prows slowly in the gilded tide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A steersman sings, and up the riverside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gay contagious ditty spreads and runs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the shouts, the uproar of the guns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nickering of horses.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">So, they say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went forth a hundred singing men that day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And girlish April went ahead of them.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The music of her trailing garment’s hem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed scarce a league ahead. A little speed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might yet almost surprise her in the deed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sorcery; for, ever as they strove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gray-green smudge in every poplar grove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proclaimed the recent kindling. Aye, it seemed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That bird and bush and tree had only dreamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of song and leaf and blossom, till they heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young men’s feet; when tree and bush and bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unleashed the whole conspiracy of awe!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pale green was every slough about the Kaw;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the Platte, pale green was every slough;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the pale green lingered at the Sioux,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So close they trailed the marching of the South.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when they reached the Niobrara’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The witchery of spring had taken flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like a girl grown woman over night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Young summer glowed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">And now the river rose,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gigantic from a feast of northern snows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mightily the snub prows felt the tide;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But with the loud, sail-filling South allied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tow-crews battled gaily day by day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seldom lulled the struggle on the way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But some light jest availed to fling along</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The panting lines the laughter of the strong,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For joy sleeps lightly in the hero’s mood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the sky-wide prairie solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was darkened round them, and the camp was set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Secure for well-earned sleep that came not yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What stories shaped for marvel or for mirth!⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tales fit to strain the supper-tightened girth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looped yarns, wherein the veteran spinners vied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To color with a lie more glorified</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some thread that had veracity enough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spun straightway out of life’s own precious stuff</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That each had scutched and heckled in the raw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then thinner grew each subsequent guffaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While drowsily the story went the rounds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And o’er the velvet dark the summer sounds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prevailed in weird crescendo more and more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the story-teller with a snore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gave over to a dream a tale half told.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now the horseguards, while the night grows old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With intermittent singing buffet sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That surges subtly down the starry deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On waves of odor from the manless miles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of summer-haunted prairie. Now, at whiles,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The kiote’s mordant clamor cleaves the drowse.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horses stamp and blow; about the prows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dark waters chug and gurgle; as with looms</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bugs weave a drone; a beaver’s diving booms,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat bluffs grumble in their sable cowls.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The devil laughter of the prairie owls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mocks mirth anon, like unrepentant sin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perceptibly at last slow hours wear thin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The east, until the prairie stares with morn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And horses nicker to the boatman’s horn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That blares the music of a day begun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So through the days of thunder and of sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They pressed to northward. Now the river shrank,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grass turned yellow and the men were lank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gnarled with labor. Smooth-lipped lads matured</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twixt moon and moon with all that they endured,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their faces leathered by the wind and glare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their eyes grown ageless with the calm far stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of men who know the prairies or the seas.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they reached the village of the Rees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One scarce might say, This man is young, this old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save for the beard.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Here loitered days of gold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And days of leisure, welcome to the crews;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For recently had come the wondrous news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of beaver-haunts beyond the Great Divide⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So rich a tale ’twould seem the tellers lied,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had they not much fine peltry to attest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So now the far off River of the West</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Became the goal of venture for the band;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And since the farther trail lay overland</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where the Great Falls thundered to no ear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They paused awhile to buy more ponies here</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With powder, liquor, gauds and wily words.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A horse-fond people, opulent in herds,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Rees were; and the trade was very good.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now camped along the river-fringing wood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three sullen, thunder-brewing, rainless days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those weathered men made merry in their ways</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With tipple, euchre, story, jest and song.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The marksmen matched their cleverness; the strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wrestled the strong; and brawling pugilists</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Displayed the boasted power of their fists</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In stubborn yet half amicable fights.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whisky went hell-roaring through the nights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the lodges of the fuddled Rees.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus merrily the trappers took their ease,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rejoicing in the thread that Clotho spun;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For it was good to feel the bright thread run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>However eager for the snipping shears.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O joy long stifled in the ruck of years!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How many came to strange and bitter ends!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And who was merrier than those three friends</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom here a song remembers for their woe?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Will Carpenter, Mike Fink and Frank Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were they⁠—each gotten of a doughty breed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For in the blood of them the ancient seed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Saxon, Celt and Norman grew again.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Mississippi reared no finer men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rarely the Ohio knew their peers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For pluck and prowess⁠—even in those years</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When stern life yielded suck but to the strong.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor in the hundred Henry took along</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was found their match⁠—and each man knew it well.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For instance, when it suited Mike to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tale that called for laughter, as he thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hearer laughed right heartily, or fought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took a drubbing. Then, if more complained,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Those three lacked not for logic that explained</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The situation in no doubtful way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Me jokes are always funny” Mike would say;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And most men freely granted that they were.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A lanky, rangy man was Carpenter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quite six feet two from naked heel to crown;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, though crow-lean, he brought the steelyard down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With twice a hundred notched upon the bar.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor was he stooped, as tali men often are;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cedar of a man, he towered straight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One might have judged him lumbering of gait,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he was still; but when he walked or ran,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stepped it lightly like a little man⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And such a one is very good to see.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not his the tongue for quip or repartee;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His wit seemed slow; and something of the child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came o’er his rough-hewn features, when he smiled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mock the perching brow and eagle nose.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas when he fought the true import of those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew clear, though even then his mien deceived;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For less in wrath, he seemed, than mildly grieved⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Which made his blows no whit less true or hard.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His hair was flax fresh gleaming from the card;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eyes, the flax in bloom.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">A match in might,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink lacked five inches of his comrade’s height,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of his weight scarce twenty pounds, they say.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His hair was black, his small eyes greenish gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And restless as though feeling out of place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In such a jocund plenilunar face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed made just for laughter. Then one saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pert pugnacious nose, the forward jaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The breadth of stubborn cheekbones, and one knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That jest and fight to him were scarcely two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But rather shifting phases of the joy</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He felt in living. Careless as a boy,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Free handed with a gift or with a blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And giving either unto friend or foe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With frank good will, no man disliked him long.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They say his voice could glorify a song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>However loutish might the burden be;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the way from Pittsburg to the sea</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Rabelaisian stories of the rogue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran wedded to the richness of his brogue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wheresoever boatmen came to drink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There someone broached some escapade of Fink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That well might fill the goat-hoofed with delight;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Mike, the pantagruelizing wight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was happy in the health of bone and brawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And had the code and conscience of the faun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To guide him blithely down the easy way.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A questionable hero, one might say:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so indeed, by any civil law.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moreover, at first glimpse of him one saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bull-necked fellow, seeming over stout;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tremendous at a heavy lift, no doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But wanting action. By the very span</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of chest and shoulders, one misjudged the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he was clothed. But when he stripped to swim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men flocked about to have a look at him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Moved vaguely by that body’s wonder-scheme</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein the shape of God’s Adamic dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was victor over stubborn dust again!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>O very lovely is a maiden, when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old creative thrill is set astir</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along her blood, and all the flesh of her</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is shapen as to music! Fair indeed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tall horse, lean of flank, clean-limbed for speed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep-chested for endurance! Very fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A soaring tree, aloof in violet air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a hill! And ’tis a glorious thing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see a bank-full river in the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fight homeward! Children wonderful to see⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Girl, the Horse, the River and the Tree⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As any suckled at the breast of sod;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dissolving symbols leading back to God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through vista after vista of the Plan!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But surely none is fairer than a man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In whom the lines of might and grace are one.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Bronzed with exposure to the wind and sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold the splendid creature that was Fink!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You see him strolling to the river’s brink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All ease, and yet tremendously alive.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He pauses, poised on tiptoe for the dive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And momently it seems the mother mud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Quick with a mystic seed whose sap is blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mysteriously rears a human flower.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clean as a windless flame the lines of power</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Run rhythmic up the stout limbs, muscle-laced,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Athwart the ropy gauntness of the waist,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The huge round girth of chest, whereover spread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Enormous shoulders. Now above his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He lifts his arms where big thews merge and flow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As in some dream of Michelangelo;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up along the dimpling back there run,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like lazy serpents stirring in the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow waves that break and pile upon the slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that great neck in swelling rolls, agrope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the velvet softness of the skin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now suddenly the lean waist grows more thin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deep chest on a sudden grows more deep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with the swiftness of a tiger’s leap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The easy grace of hawks in swooping flight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That terrible economy of might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beauty plunges outward from the brink.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus God had made experiment with Fink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As proving how ’twere best that men might grow.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One turned from Mike to look upon Talbeau⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little man, scarce five feet six and slim⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wondered what his comrades saw in him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To justify their being thus allied.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was it a sort of planetary pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In lunar adoration? Hark to Mike:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Shure I declare I niver saw his like⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A skinny whiffet of a man! And yit⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well, do ye moind the plisint way we mit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how he interjooced hisself that day?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas up at Pittsburg, liquor flowin’ fray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ivrybody happy as a fool.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I cracked me joke and thin, as is me rule,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked round to view the havoc of me wit;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ivrywan was doubled up wid it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save only wan, and him a scrubby mite.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Says I, and shure me language was polite,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>‘And did ye hear me little joke?’ says I.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>‘I did’ says he. ‘And can’t ye laugh, me b’y?’</span>
						<br/>
						<span>‘I can’t’ says he, the sassy little chap.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did I git me hand back from the slap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I give him till he landed on me glim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And I was countin’ siventeen of him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ivry dancin’ wan of him was air!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Faith, whin I hit him he was niver there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shure it seemed that ivry wind that blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was peltin’ knuckles in me face. Hurroo!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That toime, fer wance, I got me fill of fun!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>God bless the little whiffet! It begun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along about the shank of afthernoon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whin I washed me face, I saw the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A-shakin’ wid its laughther in the shtrame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whin, betoimes, he wakened from his drame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I says to him, ‘Ye needn’t laugh, me b’y:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cliver little man ye are,’ says I.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Och, the face of me! I’m tellin’ fac’s⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ye’d wonder did he do it wid an ax!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas foine! ’Twas art!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Thus, eloquent with pride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike Fink, an expert witness, testified</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Talbeau’s fistic prowess.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Now they say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There lived no better boatmen in their day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than those three comrades; and the larger twain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In that wide land three mighty rivers drain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found not their peers for skill in marksmanship.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Writes one, who made the long Ohio trip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With those boon cronies in their palmy days,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How once Mike Fink beheld a sow at graze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the bank amid her squealing brood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how Mike, being in a merry mood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shot off each wiggling piglet’s corkscrew tail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At twenty yards, while under easy sail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The boat moved on. And Carpenter could bore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A squirrel’s eye clean at thirty steps and more⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So many say. But ’twas their dual test</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of mutual love and skill they liked the best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of all their shooting tricks⁠—when one stood up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At sixty paces with a whisky cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Set brimming for a target on his head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And felt the gusty passing of the lead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hot from the other’s rifle, lift his hair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever was the tin cup smitten fair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By each, to prove the faith of each anew:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twas a rite of love between the two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And not a mere capricious feat of skill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Och, shure, and can ye shoot the whisky, Bill?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Mike would end a wrangle. “Damn it, Fink!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let’s bore a pair of cups and have a drink!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Carpenter would stop a row grown stale.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And neither feared that either love might fail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or either skill might falter.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Thus appear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The doughty three who held each other dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For qualities they best could comprehend.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now came the days of leisure to an end⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The days so gaily squandered, that would seem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To men at length made laughterless, a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unthinkably remote; for Ilion held</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath her sixfold cerement of Eld</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seems not so hoar as bygone joy we prize</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In evil days. Now vaguely pale the skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The glimmer neither starlight’s nor the morn’s.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A rude ironic merriment of horns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Startles the men yet heavy with carouse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sets a Ree dog mourning in the drowse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snout skyward from a lodge top. Sleepy birds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chirp in the brush. A drone of sullen words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awakes and runs increasing through the camp.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thin smoke plumes, rising in the valley damp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flatten among the leathern tents and make</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole encampment like a ghostly lake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where bobbing heads of swimmers come and go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with the whimsy of an undertow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sucks and spews them. Raising dust and din,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The horseguards drive their shaggy rabble in</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From nightlong grazing. Voyageurs, with packs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of folded tents and camp gear on their backs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slouch boatward through the reek. But when prevails</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smell of frying pans and coffee pails,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They cease to sulk and, greatly heartened, sing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till ponies swell the chorus, nickering,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And race-old comrades jubilate as one.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Out of a roseless dawn the heat-pale sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld them toiling northward once again⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hundred horses and a hundred men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hushed in a windless swelter. Day on day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The same white dawn overtook them on their way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And daylong in the white glare sang no bird,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But only shrill grasshoppers clicked and whirred,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the heat were vocal. All the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dwindling current lengthened, mile on mile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meandrous in a labyrinth of sand.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now e’er they left the Ree town by the Grand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The revellers had seen the spent moon roam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The morning, like a tipsy hag bound home.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bubble-laden boat, they saw it sail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sunset river of a fairy tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When they were camped beside the Cannonball.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spectral sun, it held the dusk in thrall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nightlong about the Heart. The stars alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the cluttered Mandan lodges shone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The night they slept below the Knife. And when</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their course, long westward, shifted once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lead them north, the August moon was new.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The rainless Southwest wakened now and blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wilting, worrying, breath-sucking gale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That roared one moment in the bellied sail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Next moment slackened to a lazy croon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now came the first misfortune. All forenoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With line and pole the sweating boatmen strove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the east bank, while the horseguards drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drooping herd a little to the fore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the current took the other shore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Straight on, a maze of bar and shallow lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The main stream running half a mile away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To westward of a long low willow isle.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An hour they fought that stubborn half a mile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of tumbled water. Down the running planks</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The polesmen toiled in endless slanting ranks.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now swimming, now a-flounder in the ooze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some blind bar, the naked cordelle crews</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sought any kind of footing for a pull;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While gust-bedevilled sails, now booming full,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now flapping slack, gave questionable aid.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The west bank gained, along a ragged shade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of straggling cottonwoods the boatmen sprawled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And panted. Out across the heat-enthralled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wind-fretted waste of shoal and bar they saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The string of ponies ravelled up a draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That mounted steeply eastward from the vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, like a rampart flung across the trail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bluff rose sheer. Heads low, yet loath to graze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They waxed and withered in the oily haze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now ponies, now a crawling flock of sheep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind them three slack horseguards, half asleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swayed limply, leaning on their saddle-bows.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The boat crews, lolling in a semi-doze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still watch the herd; nor do the gazers dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What drama nears a climax over stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What others yonder may be watching too.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now looming large upon the lucent blue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The foremost ponies top the rim, and stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>High-headed down the vacancies of air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath them; while the herders dawdle still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gather wool scarce halfway up the hill⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A slumbrous sight beheld by heavy eyes.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But hark! What murmuring of far-flung cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From yonder pocket in the folded rise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That flanks the draw? The herders also hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a start glance upward to the rear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their spurred mounts plunge! What do they see but dust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whipped skyward yonder in a freakish gust?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What panic overtakes them? Look again!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rolling dust cloud vomits mounted men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ruck of tossing heads and gaudy gears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath a bristling thicket of lean spears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slant in a gust of onset!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Over stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The boatmen stare dumbfounded. Like a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In some vague region out of space and time</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Evolves the swiftly moving pantomime</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before those loungers with ungirded loins;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till one among them shouts “<em>Assinboines!</em>”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And swelling to a roar, the wild word runs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above a pell-mell scramble for the guns,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perceived as futile soon. Yet here and there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A few young hotheads fusillade the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rage the more to know the deed absurd.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some only grind their teeth without a word;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some stand aghast, some grinningly inane,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While some, like watch-dogs rabid at the chain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Growl curses, pacing at the river’s rim.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So might unhappy spirits haunt the dim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far shore of Styx, beholding outrage done</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To loved ones in the region of the sun⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rage goaded by its own futility!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>For one vast moment strayed from time, they see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The war band flung obliquely down the slope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flying herdsmen, seemingly agrope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In sudden darkness for their saddle guns.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A murmuring shock! And now the whole scene runs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Into a dusty blur of horse and man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the herd’s rear surges on the van</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That takes the cue of panic fear and flies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stampeding to the margin of the skies,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till all have vanished in the deeps of air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now outlined sharply on the sky-rim there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The victors pause and taunt their helpless foes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With buttocks patted and with thumbs at nose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And jeers scarce hearkened for the wind’s guffaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They also vanish. In the sunwashed draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remains no sign of what has come to pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save three dark splotches on the yellow grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where now the drowsy horseguards have their will.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>At sundown on the summit of the hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The huddled boatmen saw the burial squad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tuck close their comrades’ coverlet of sod⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weird silhouettes on melancholy gray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And very few found anything to say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That night; though some spoke gently of the dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembering what that one did or said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At such and such a time. And some, more stirred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With lust of vengeance for the stolen herd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swore vaguely now and then beneath their breath.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some, brooding on the imminence of death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew wistful of their unreturning years;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some who found their praying in arrears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made shift to liquidate the debt that night.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>But when once more the cheerful morning light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came on them toiling, also came the mood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of young adventure, and the solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sang with them. For ’tis glorious to spend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One’s golden days large-handed to the end⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The good broadpieces that can buy so much!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what may hoarders purchase but a crutch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherewith to hobble graveward?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">On they pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where once more the river led them west;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And every day the hot wind, puff on puff,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assailed them; every night they heard it sough</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In thickets prematurely turning sere.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then came the sudden breaking of the year.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Abruptly in a waning afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hot wind ceased, as fallen in a swoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With its own heat. For hours the swinking crews</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had bandied scarcely credible good news</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of clouds across the dim northwestward plain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they who offered wagers on the rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Found ready takers, though the gloomy rack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With intermittent rumbling at its back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had mounted slowly. Now it towered high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A blue-black wall of night across the sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shot through with glacial green.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">A mystic change!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun was hooded and the world went strange⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A picture world! The hollow hush that fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made loud the creaking of the taut cordelle,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bent spar’s groan, the plunk of steering poles.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bodeful calm lay glassy on the shoals;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The current had the look of flowing oil.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw the cloud’s lip billow now and boil⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black breakers gnawing at a coast of light;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw the stealthy wraith-arms of the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grope for the day to strangle it; they saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The up-stream reaches vanish in a flaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of driving sand: and scarcely were the craft</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made fast to clumps of willow fore and aft,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When with a roar the blinding fury rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon them; and the breath of it was cold.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There fell no rain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">That night was calm and clear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just such a night as when the waning year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has set aflare the old Missouri wood;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Greenings are beginning to be good;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when, so hollow is the frosty hush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One hears the ripe persimmons falling⁠—<i>plush!</i>⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the littered leaves. The kindly time!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With cider in the vigor of its prime,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just strong enough to edge the dullest wit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should neighbor folk drop in awhile to sit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gossip. O the dear flame-painted gloam,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The backlog’s sputter on the hearth at home⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How far away that night! Thus many a lad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grown strangely old, remembered and was sad.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wolves mourned among the bluffs. Like hanks of wool</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fog flecked the river. And the moon was full.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A week sufficed to end the trail. They came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the lesser river gives its name</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And meed of waters to the greater stream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here, lacking horses, they must nurse the dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of beaver haunts beyond the Great Divide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Build quarters for the winter trade, and bide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The coming up of Ashley and his band.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So up and down the wooded tongue of land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That thins to where the rivers wed, awoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sound of many axes, stroke on stroke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lustily the hewers sang at whiles⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The better to forget the homeward miles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this, the homing time. And when the geese</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With cacophonic councils broke the peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of frosty nights before they took to wing;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When cranes went over daily, southering,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And blackbirds chattered in the painted wood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mile above the river junction stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fort, adjoining the Missouri’s tide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foursquare and thirty paces on a side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wall of sharpened pickets bristled round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A group of sod-roofed cabins. Bastions frowned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From two opposing corners, set to brave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A foe on either flank; and stout gates gave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the stream, where now already came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Indian craft, lured thither by the fame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of traders building by the mating floods.</span>

						<p epub:type="title">To the Musselshell</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>Now came at dawn a party of the Bloods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who told of having paddled seven nights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To parley for their people with the Whites,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The long way lying ’twixt a foe and foe;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ever on their right hand lurked the Crow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on their left hand, the Assiniboine.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The crane-winged news, that where the waters join</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Long Knives built a village, made them sad;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the pastures thereabouts were bad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sustaining few and very scrawny herds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So they had hastened hither, bringing words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of kindness from their mighty men, to tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What welcome waited on the Musselshell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where stood the winter lodges of their band.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They rhapsodized the fatness of that land:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lush valleys where all summer bison ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To grass grown higher than a mounted man!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, winter long on many a favored slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bison grazed with goat and antelope,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor were they ever leaner in the spring!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One heard the diving beaver’s thundering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the streams at night; and one might hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Uncounted bull elks whistle, when the year</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was painted for its death. Their squaws were good,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strong bearers of the water and the wood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With quiet tongues and never weary hands;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tall as the fighting men of other lands,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And good to look upon. These things were so!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why else then should Assiniboine and Crow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assail the Bloods?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Now flaring up, they spoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of battles and their haters blown as smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the blizzard of their people’s ire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Devoured as grass before a prairie fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That licks the heavens when the Northwind runs!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, none the less, their warriors needed guns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And powder. Wherefor, let the Great White Chief</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Return with them, ere yet the painted leaf</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fallen. If so be he might not leave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>This land of peoples skillful to deceive,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who, needing much, had scarce a hide to sell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then send a party to the Musselshell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To trade and trap until the grass was young</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And calves were yellow. With no forkèd tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Bloods had spoken. Had the White Chief ears?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So Major Henry called for volunteers;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Fink was ready on the word to go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“And chance the bloody naygurs”; then Talbeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then Carpenter; and after these were nine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In whom young blood was like a beading wine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who lusted for the venture.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Late that night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Bloods set out for home. With day’s first light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dozen trappers followed, paddling west</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In six canoes. And whatso suited best</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whimsies of the savage or his needs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slim craft carried⁠—scarlet cloth and beads,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some antiquated muskets, powder, ball,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Traps, knives, and little casks of alcohol</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lubricate the rusty wheels of trade!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So, singing as they went, the blithe brigade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Departed, with their galloping canoes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heeding the tune. They had no time to lose;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For long and stubborn was the up-stream way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when they launched their boats at break of day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard a thin ice tinkle at the prows.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A bodeful silence and a golden drowse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Possessed the land. The Four Winds held their breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before a vast serenity of death,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein it seemed the reminiscent Year⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A yearning ghost now⁠—wrought about its bier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some pale hallucination of its May.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bleak stretched the prairie to the walls of day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So dry, that where a loping kiote broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its loneliness, it smouldered into smoke:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when a herd of bison rumbled past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas like a great fire booming in a blast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The rolling smudge whereof concealed the flame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Proceeding in the truce of winds, they came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In five days to the vale the Poplar drains.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A trailing flight of southbound whooping cranes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the fading West, was like a scrawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cabalistic warning on a wall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And counselled haste. In seven days they reached</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The point where Wolf Creek empties in, and beached</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their keels along its dusty bed. In nine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Elk Prairie and the Little Porcupine,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now waterless, had fallen to the rear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tenth sun failed them on the lone frontier</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where flows the turbid Milk by countless bends</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where Assiniboian country ends</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Blackfoot Land begins. The hollow gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All night resounded with the beaver’s boom;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wolf pack yammered from a distant hill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anon a rutting elk cried, like a shrill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arpeggio blown upon a flageolet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A half day more their lifting prows were set</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To westward; then the flowing trail led south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two days by many a bend to Hell Creek’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the Badlands. Gazing from a height,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lookout saw the marching of the Night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across a vast black waste of peaks and deeps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That could have been infernal cinder-heaps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The relics of an ancient hell gone cold.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That night they saw a wild aurora rolled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the lifeless wilderness. It formed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Northeastwardly in upright waves that stormed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To westward, sequent combers of the bow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gulfed Polaris in their undertow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hurtled high upon the Ursine Isles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A surf of ghostly fire. Again, at whiles,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shimmering silken veil, it puffed and swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere the painted curtain of the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That fluttered in a rising gale of doom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when it vanished in the starry gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One said “ ’Twill blow tomorrow.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">So it did.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ere noon they raised the Half Way Pyramid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Southwestward; saw its wraith-like summit lift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seem to float northwest against a drift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wind-whipped dust. The lunar hills about⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where late a bird’s note startled like a shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hush that seemed the body of old Time⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now bellowed where the hoofs of Yotunheim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foreran the grizzled legions of the Snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas peep of day when it began to blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A zephyr growing stronger with the light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now by fits it churned the river white</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whipped the voyageurs with freezing spray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The windward reaches took their breath away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ghost-white and numb with cold, from bend to bend,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where transiently the wind became a friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To drive them south, they battled; till at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around a jutting bluff they met a blast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That choked as with a hand upon their throats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The song they sang for courage; hurled their boats</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the farther shore and held them pinned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A sting of spitting snow was in the wind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Southwest by west across the waste, where fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A murky twilight, lay the Musselshell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two days of travel with the crow for guide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here must they find them shelter, and abide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The passing of the blizzard as they could.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The banks bore neither plum nor cottonwood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all the hills were naked as a hand.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But where, debouching from the broken land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A river in the spring was wont to flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A northward moving herd of buffalo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had crossed the river, evidently bound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From failing pastures to the grazing ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the Milk: and where the herd had passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was scattered <i xml:lang="fr">bois de vache</i> enough to last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the storm abated. So they packed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great blanketfuls of sun-dried chips, and stacked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The precious fuel where the wind was stilled⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pocket hemmed by lofty bluffs and filled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With mingled dusk and thunder; bore therein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Canoes and cargo, pitched their tents of skin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About a central heap of glowing chips,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dined on brittle bull-meat dried in strips,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With rum to wash it down.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">It snowed all night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The earth and heavens, in the morning light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were one white fury; and the stream ran slush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two days and nights the gale boomed; then a hush</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell with the sun; and when the next dawn came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pale flare flanked by mockeries of flame⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The river lay as solid as the land.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now caching half their goods, the little band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Resumed the journey, toiling under packs;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And twice they felt the morning at their backs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A laggard traveller; and twice they saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sunset dwindle to a starry awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the frozen vast, while still they pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The journey⁠—bearded faces yearning west,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White as the waste they trod. Then one day more,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Southwestward, brought them to the jutting shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That faced the goal.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">A strip of poplars stretched</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along a winding stream, their bare boughs etched</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black line by line upon a flat of snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blue tinted in the failing afterglow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Humped ponies ’mid the drifts and clumps of sage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went nosing after grudging pasturage</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where’er it chanced the blizzard’s whimsic flaws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had swept the slough grass bare. A flock of squaws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Chopped wood and chattered in the underbrush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their ax strokes thudding dully in the hush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their nasal voices rising shrill and clear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, circled ’neath a bluff that towered sheer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the stream, snug lodges wrought of hide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Smoke-plumed and glowing with the fires inside,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made glad the gazers. Even as they stood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Content to stare a moment, from the wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clamor deepened, and a running shout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the lodges brought the dwellers out,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Braves, squaws, papooses; and the wolf dogs bayed;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And up the flat the startled ponies neighed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pricking their ears to question what befell.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So came Fink’s party to the Musselshell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gaunt, bearded, yet⁠—how gloriously young</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then, what feasts of bison fleece and tongue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of browned boudin and steaming humprib stew!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What roaring nights of wassailing they knew⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gargantuan regales⁠—when through the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fiery liquor ravined, melting down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tribal hoard of beaver! How they made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their merest gewgaws mighty in the trade!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, merry men they were! Nor could they know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How even then there came that wraith of woe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amongst them; some swift-fingered Fate that span</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stuff of sorrow, wove ’twixt man and man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tangling mesh, that friend might ruin friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each go stumbling to a bitter end⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A threefold doom that now the Song recalls.</span>

					<p>
						<span>There was a woman.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">What enchantment falls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon that far off revel! How the din</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of jangling voices, chaffering to win</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lesser values, hushes at the words,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As dies the dissonance of brawling birds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a calm before the storm is hurled!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lo, down the age-long reaches of the world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What rose-breatht wind of ghostly music creeps!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And was she fair⁠—this woman? Legend keeps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No answer; yet we know that she was young,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If truly comes the tale by many a tongue</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That one of Red Hair’s party fathered her.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What need to know her features as they were?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was she not lovely as her lover’s thought,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And beautiful as that wild love she wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was fatal? Vessel of the world’s desire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Did she not glow with that mysterious fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That lights the hearth or burns the rooftree down?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What face was hers who made the timeless town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A baleful torch forever? Hers who wailed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the altar when the four winds failed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Aulis? What the image that looked up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Iseult from the contemplated cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of everlasting thirst? What wondrous face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the countless cradles of the race</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Makes sudden heaven for the blinking eyes?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One face in truth! And once in Paradise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Each man shall stray unwittingly, and see⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In some unearthly valley where the Tree</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With golden fruitage perilously fraught</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still stands⁠—that image of God’s afterthought.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then shall the world turn wonderful and strange!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Who knows how came that miracle of change</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Fink at last? For he was not of such</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As tend to prize one woman overmuch;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And legend has it that, from Pittsburg down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To Baton Rouge, in many a river town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some blowsy Ariadne pined for Mike.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“It is me rule to love ’em all alike.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He often said, with slow, omniscient wink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When just the proper quantity of drink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had made him philosophic; “Glass or gourd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shure, now, they’re all wan liquor whin they’re poured!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aye, rum is rum, me b’y!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Alas, the tongue!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How glibly are its easy guesses flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the knowing reticence of years,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To echo laughter in the time of tears,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Raw gusts of mocking merriment that stings!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some logic in the seeming ruck of things</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inscrutably confutes us!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Now had come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The time when rum no longer should be rum,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But witchwine sweet with peril. It befell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In this wise, insofar as tongue may tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tongues repeat the little eyes may guess</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of what may happen in that wilderness,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The human heart. There dwelt a mighty man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Bloods, a leader of his clan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Around whose life were centered many lives,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For many sons had he of many wives;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And also he was rich in pony herds.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherefore, they say, men searched his lightest words</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For hidden things, since anyone might see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That none had stronger medicine than he</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To shape aright the stubborn stuff of life.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the women that he had to wife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was she who knew the white man when the band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Red Hair made such marvel in the land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She being younger then and little wise.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But in that she was pleasing to the eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And kept her fingers busy for her child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bore a silent tongue, the great man smiled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the woman, called her to his fire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gave the Long Knife’s girl a foster sire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So that her maidenhood was never lean,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But like a pasture that is ever green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because it feels a mountain’s sunny flank.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now in the season when the pale sun shrank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far southward, like another kind of moon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dawns were laggard and the dark came soon,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It pleased the great man’s whim to give a feast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas five days after Carpenter went east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With eight stout ponies and a band of three</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To lift the cache; a fact that well might be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sly father to the great man’s festive mood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wistfully prospective gratitude,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anticipating charity!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">It chanced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That while the women sang and young men danced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the drummers, and the pipe went round,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever ’twixt the songs arose the sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fat dog stewing, Fink, with mournful eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pious mien, lamented the demise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of “pore owld Fido,” till his comrades choked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With stifled laughter; soberly invoked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The plopping stew (“Down, Rover I Down, me lad!”);</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discussed the many wives the old man had</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In language more expressive than polite.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, last of all his merry nights, that night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink clowned it, little dreaming he was doomed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wear that mask of sorrow he assumed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In comic mood, thenceforward to the last.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For even as he joked, the net was cast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About him, and the mystic change had come,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he had looked on rum that was not rum⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Long Knife’s daughter!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Stooped beneath a pack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bundled twigs, she pushed the lodge-flap back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And entered lightly; placed her load of wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the fire; then straightened up and stood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One moment there, a shapely girl and tall.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There wasn’t any drama: that was all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when she left, the wit had died in Fink.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed a man who takes the one more drink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That spoils the fun, relaxes jaw and jowl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And makes the jester, like a sunstruck owl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stare solemnly at nothing.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">All next day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He moped about with scarce a word to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And no one dared investigate his whim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when the twilight came, there fell on him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sentimental, reminiscent mood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though upon some frozen solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within him, breathed a softening chinook,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far strayed across the alplike years that look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On what one used to be and what one is.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he raised that mellow voice of his</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In songs of lovers wedded to regret,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis said that, unashamed, men’s eyes grew wet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So poignantly old memories were stirred.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And much his comrades marvelled as they heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ribald jester singing thus of love.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor could they solve the mystery thereof,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until at dawn they saw him rise and take</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A rifle of the latest Hawkin make,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ball, powder, and a bolt of scarlet goods,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hasten to the fringe of cottonwoods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where rose the great man’s lodge smoke. Then they knew;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For thus with gifts the Bloods were wont to woo</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The daughter through the sire.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">The white sun burned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Midmost the morning steep when he returned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Without his load and humming as he went.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hour by hour he squatted in his tent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stared upon the fire; save now and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stirred himself to lift the flap again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And cast an anxious gaze across the snows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where stood the chieftain’s lodge. And well did those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who saw him know what sight he hoped to see;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For ’twas the custom that the bride-to-be</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should carry food to him she chose to wed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile, with seemly caution, be it said,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink’s men enjoyed a comedy, and laid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sly wagers on the coming of the maid⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She would! She wouldn’t! So the brief day waned.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now when the sun, a frosty specter maned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With corruscating vapors, lingered low</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shadows lay like steel upon the snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An old squaw, picking faggots in the brush,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw that which set her shrieking in the hush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“They come! They come!” Then someone shouted “Crows!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The town spewed tumult, men with guns and bows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half clad and roaring; shrill hysteric wives</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sticks of smoking firewood, axes, knives;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dogs, bristle-necked and snarling. So they pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To meet a foe, as from a stricken nest</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hornet swarm boils over.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">Blinking, dazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sudden light and panic fear, they gazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the frozen waste; and then they saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eight laden ponies filing up the draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their nostrils steaming, slack of neck and slow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind them, stumbling in the broken snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three weary trappers trudged, while in the lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strode Carpenter. A goodly sight, indeed!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upstanding, eagle-faced and eagle-eyed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ease of latent power in his stride,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He dwarfed the panting pony that he led;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the level sunlight ’round his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made glories in the frosted beard and hair,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some Gothic fighting god seemed walking there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strayed from the dim Hercynian woods of old.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>How little of a story can be told!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let him who knows what happens in the seed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the sprout breaks sunward, make the deed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A plummet for the dreaming deeps that surged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the surface ere the deed emerged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For neat appraisal by the rule of thumb!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The best of Clio is forever dumb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To human ears at least. Nor shall the Song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Presume to guess and tell how all night long,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While roared the drunken orgy and the trade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Doom quickened in the fancy of a maid,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The daughter of the Long Knife; how she saw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely moving through a spacious awe</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind shut lids where never came the brawl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shining one, magnificently tall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A day-crowned mortal brother of the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Suffice it here that, when the night was done</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And morning, like an uproar in the east,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused the town still heavy with the feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All men might see what whimsic, fatal bloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A soil, dream-plowed and seeded in the gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had nourished unto blowing in the day.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas then the girl appeared and took her way</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the snow with hesitating feet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She bore a little pot of steaming meat;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when midmost the open space, she turned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And held it up to where the morning burned,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who begs a blessing of the skies.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unconscious of the many peeping eyes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Erect, with wrapt uplifted face she stood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A miracle of shapely maidenhood⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the flaming god. And many heard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or seemed to hear by piecing word to word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prayer she muttered to the wintry sky:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“O Sun, behold a maiden! Pure am I!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look kindly on the little gift I give;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, save you smile upon it, what can live?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bright Father, hear a maiden!” Then, as one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who finds new courage for a task begun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She turned and hastened to the deed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i20">They say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was no dearth of gossiping that day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the lodges. Shrewish tongues there were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That clacked no happy prophecies of her.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And many wondered at the chieftain’s whim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Long Knife’s girl had wrought a spell on him;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why else then was he silent? See her shrink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moment there before the tent of Fink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who feels a sudden sleety blast!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But look again! She starts, and hurries past!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All round the circled village, lodges yawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see how brazen in the stare of dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A petted girl may be. For now, behold!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was ever maiden of the Bloods so bold?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She stops before another tent and stoops,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Her fingers feeling for the buckskin loops</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That bind the rawhide flap. ’Tis opened wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slant white light of morning falls inside,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And half the town may witness at whose feet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She sets the little pot of steaming meat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Tis Carpenter!</span>

					<p>
						<span class="i8">Perceptibly, at length,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The days grew longer, and the winter’s strength</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Increased to fury. Down across the flat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blizzards bellowed; and the people sat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fur-robed about the smoky fires that stung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their eyes to streaming, when a freak gust flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sharp reek back with flaws of powdered snow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And much the old men talked of long ago,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invoking ghostly Winters from the Past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till cold snap after cold snap followed fast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And none might pile his verbal snow so deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But some athletic memory could heap</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drifts a trifle higher; give the cold</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A greater rigor in the story told;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Put bellows to a wind already high.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever greater reverence thereby</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The old men won from gaping youths, who heard,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like marginalia to the living word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The howling of the poplars tempest-bent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The smoke-flap cracking sharply at the vent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lodge poles creaking eerily. And O!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The happy chance of living long ago,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of having wrinkles now and being sires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many tales to tell around the fires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of days when things were bigger! All night long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White hands came plucking at the buckskin thong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That bound the door-flap, and the writhing dark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was shrill with spirits. By the snuffling bark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of dogs men knew that homesick ghosts were there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And often in a whirl of chilling air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The weird ones entered, though the flap still held,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Built up in smoke the shapes they knew of eld,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grew thin and long to vanish as they came.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now had the scandal, like a sudden flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fed fat with grasses, perished in the storm.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fundamental need of keeping warm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sufficed the keenest gossip for a theme;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whimsies faded like a warrior’s dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When early in the dawn the foemen cry.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The time when calves are black had blustered by⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A weary season⁠—since the village saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The chiefs wife pitching for her son-in-law</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nuptial lodge she fashioned. Like a bow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That feels the arrow’s head, the moon hung low</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That evening when they gave the wedding gifts;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And men had seen it glaring through the rifts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wintry war as up the east it reeled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A giant warrior’s battle-bitten shield⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But now it braved no more the charging air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meanwhile the lodge of Carpenter stood there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the chieftain’s, huddled in the snows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like a story everybody knows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was little heeded now.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">But there was one</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who seldom noted what was said or done</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among his comrades; he would sit and look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the fire, as one who reads a book</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of woeful doings, ever on the brink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of ultimate disaster. It was Fink:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And seeing this, Talbeau was sick at heart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With dreading that his friends might drift apart</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he be lost, because he loved them both.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, knowing well Mike’s temper, he was loath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To broach the matter. Also, knowing well</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That silence broods upon the hottest hell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He prayed that Fink might curse.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">So worried past</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The days of that estrangement. Then at last</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One night when round their tent the blizzard roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, nestled in their robes, the others snored,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau could bear the strain no more and spoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He opened with a random little joke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some starved hunter trying out the range</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of precious game where all the land is strange;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as the hunter, missing, hears the grim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spiteful echo-rifles mocking him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His own unmirthful laughter mocked Talbeau.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He could have touched across the ember-glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike’s brooding face⁠—yet Mike was far away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And O that nothing more than distance lay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between them⁠—any distance with an end!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How tireless then in running to his friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A man might be! For suddenly he knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That Mike would have him choose between the two.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How could he choose ’twixt Carpenter and Fink?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How idle were a choice ’twixt food and drink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, choosing neither, one were sooner dead!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Thus torn within, and hoarse with tears unshed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He strove again to find his comrade’s heart:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“O damn it, Mike, don’t make us drift apart!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Don’t do it, Mike! This ain’t a killin’ fuss,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hadn’t ought to faze the three of us</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That’s weathered many a rough-and-tumble fight!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>W’y don’t you mind that hell-a-poppin’ night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At Baton Rouge three years ago last fall⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The time we fit the whole damned dancin’ hall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And waded out nigh belly-deep in men?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O who’d have said a girl could part us, then?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, Mike, that fracas in the Vide Poche dive!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Can you forget it long as you’re alive?⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A merry time! Us strollin’ arm-in-arm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From drink to drink, not calculatin’ harm,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But curious, because <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fair boiled with greasy mountain men, come down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All brag and beaver, howlin’ for a spree!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then⁠—you mind?⁠—a feller jostled me⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas at the bar⁠—a chap all bones and big.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Says he in French: ‘You eater of a pig,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make room for mountain men!’ And then says you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In Irish, aimin’ where the whiskers grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And landin’ fair: ‘You eater of a dog,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Make room for boatmen!’ Like a punky log</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That’s water-soaked, he dropped. What happened then?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cyclone in a woods of mountain men⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That’s what! O Mike, you can’t forget it now!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what in hell’s a woman, anyhow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To memories like that?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">So spoke Talbeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, pausing, heard the hissing of the snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The snoring of the sleepers, and the cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of blizzard-beaten poplars. Still Fink’s eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the crumbling embers pored intent.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then momently, or so it seemed, there went</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across that alien gaze a softer light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when bleak windows in a moony night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flush briefly with a candle borne along.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly the weary hope grew strong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In him who saw the glimmer, and he said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“O Mike, I see the good old times ain’t dead!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why don’t you fellers shoot the whisky cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way you used to do?”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Then Fink looked up.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas bad the way the muscles twitched and worked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About his mouth, and in his eyes there lurked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some crouchant thing. “To hell wid you!” he cried.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So love and hate that night slept side by side;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hate slept well, but love lay broad awake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like a woman, for the other’s sake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eked out the lonely hours with worrying.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now came a heartsick yearning for the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon Talbeau; for surely this bad dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would vanish with the ice upon the stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old times be resurrected with the grass!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But would the winter ever, ever pass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The howling of the blizzard ever cease?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So often now he dreamed of hearing geese</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remotely honking in the rain-washed blue;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever when the blur of dawn broke through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The scudding rack, he raised the flap to see,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By sighting through a certain forkèd tree,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How much the sun made northward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">Then, one day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The curtain of the storm began to fray;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The poplars’ howling softened to a croon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun set clear, and dusk revealed the moon⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thin-blown bubble in a crystal bowl.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All night, as ’twere the frozen prairie’s soul</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That voiced a hopeless longing for the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wolves assailed with mournful questioning</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The starry deeps of that tremendous hush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dawn wore the mask of May⁠—a rosy flush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the magic of a single bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might prove the seeing of the eye absurd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And make the heaped-up winter billow green.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On second thought, one knew the air was keen⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A whetted edge in gauze. The village fires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely builded tenuous gray spires</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That vanished in the still blue deeps of awe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All prophets were agreed upon a thaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the morning stood a spear-length high,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There grew along the western rim of sky</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A bank of cloud that had a rainy look.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It mounted slowly. Then the warm chinook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to breathe a melancholy drowse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sob among the naked poplar boughs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the prairie dreamed a dream of June</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew it for a dream. All afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gale increased. The sun went down blood-red;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The young moon, perilously fragile, fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To early setting. And the long night roared.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Tempestuously broke the day and poured</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An intermittent glory through the rifts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the driven fog. The sodden drifts</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already grooved and withered in the blast;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the flying noon stared down aghast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bluffs behind the village boomed with flood.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What magic in that sound to stir the blood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of winter-weary men! For now the spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No longer seemed a visionary thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But that which any morning might bestow.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And most of all that magic moved Talbeau;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, scrutinizing Fink, he thought he saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some reflex of that February thaw⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A whit less curling of the upper lip.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O could it be returning comradeship,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That April not beholden to the moon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor chatteled to the sun?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">That afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They played at euchre. Even Fink sat in;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And though he showed no eagerness to win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forgot the trumps and played his bowers wild,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There were not lacking moments when he smiled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hesitating smile ’twixt wan and grim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed his stubborn mood embarrassed him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because regret now troubled it with shame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The great wind died at midnight. Morning came,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serene and almost indolently warm⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As when an early April thunder storm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Has cleansed the night and vanished with the gloom;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When one can feel the imminence of bloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere a spirit in the orchard trees;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, credulous of blossom, come the bees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To grumble ’round the seepages of sap.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So mused Talbeau while, pushing back the flap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Instinctively he listened for a bird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To fill the hush. Then presently he heard⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ’twas the only sound in all the world⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trickle of the melting snow that purled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tinkled in the bluffs above the town.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sight of ragged Winter patched with brown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The golden peace and, palpitant therein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That water note, spun silverly and thin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Begot a wild conviction in the man:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wounded Winter weakened; now began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The reconciliation! Hate would go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, even as the water from the snow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Old comradeship come laughing back again!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>All morning long he pondered, while the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Played seven-up. And scarce a trick was played</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But someone sang a snatch of song or made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A merry jest. And when the game was balked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By one who quite forgot his hand, and talked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of things in old <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis, none demurred.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus, by noon, it seemed the lightest word</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of careless salutation would avail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To give a happy ending to the tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of clouded friendship. So he ’rose and went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By studied indirection, to the tent</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Carpenter, as one who takes the air.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as he raised the flap and entered there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sudden gale of laughter from the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blew after him. What music in it then!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What mockery, when memory should raise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So often in the coming nights and days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ruthless echo of it!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Click on click</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the whirlwind finish of a trick</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cards fell fast, while King and Queen and Ace,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With meaner trumps for hounds, pursued the chase</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wily Knave and lurking Deuce and Ten;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When suddenly the game-enchanted men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were conscious of a shadow in the place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And glancing up they saw the smiling face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of Carpenter, thrust in above Talbeau’s.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“How goes it, Boys?” said he; and gaily those</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Returned the greeting. “Howdy, Mike!” he said;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a sullen hanging of the head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink mumbled “Howdy!” Gruff⁠—but what of that?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One can not doff displeasure like a hat⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twould dwindle snow-like.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Nothing else would do</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Carpenter should play. Now Fink played too;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, having brought his cherished ones together,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau surrendered to the languid weather</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, dreamily contented, watched the sport.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All afternoon the pictured royal court</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursued its quarry in the mimic hunt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Carpenter, now gayer than his wont,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lost much; while Fink, with scarce a word to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His whole attention fixed upon the play,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Won often. So it happened, when the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was near to setting, that the day seemed won</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For friendliness, however stood the game.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But even then that Unseen Player came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who stacks the shuffled deck of circumstance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, playing wild the Joker men call Chance,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defeats the Aces of our certainty.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The cards were dealt and Carpenter bid three.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The next man passed the bid, and so the next.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Than Fink, a trifle hesitant and vexed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bid four on spades. And there was one who said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In laughing banter: “Mike, I’ll bet my head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As how them spades of your’n’ll dig a hole!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in some subtle meaning of the soul</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wag was more a prophet than he knew.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fink held the Ace and Deuce, and that made two:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His black King scored another point with Knave.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Carpenter, to whom that Weird One gave</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A band of lesser trumps to guard his Ten,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay low until the Queen had passed, and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swept in a last fat trick for Game, and scored.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the players slapped their knees and roared:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“You’re set! You’re in the hole! He set you, Mike!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then suddenly they saw Fink crouch to strike;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ere they comprehended what they saw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There came a thud of knuckles on a jaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Carpenter rolled over on the ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One moment in a breathless lapse of sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stricken man strove groggily to ’rise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The emptiness of wonder in his eyes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turned dreamily with seeming unconcern</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon Mike’s face, where now began to burn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The livid murder-lust. ’Twixt breath and breath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hush and immobility of death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made there a timeless picture. Then a yell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a wild beast charging, broke the spell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink sprang to crush, but midway met Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who threw him as a collie dog may throw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A raging bull. But Mike was up again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wielding thrice the might of common men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He gripped the little man by nape and thigh</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lightly lifted him and swung him high</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flung him; and the smitten tent went down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then ’rose a roar that roused the teeming town,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And presently a shouting rabble surged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the wreck, whence tumblingly emerged</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A knot of men who grappled Fink and clung.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Prodigiously he rose beneath them, flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His smashing arms, man-laden, forth and back;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But stubbornly they gripped him, like a pack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That takes uncowed the maulings of a bear.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Let Carpenter get up!” they cried. “Fight fair!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fight fair! Fight fair!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">Quite leisurely the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stricken man arose, a sleepy smile</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About his quiet eyes. Indeed, he seemed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one but lately wakened, who has dreamed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A pleasing dream. But when he stroked his beard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And gazed upon his fingers, warmly smeared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With crimson from the trickle at his jaw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eyes went eagle-keen with what they saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stupor passed. He hastily untied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His buckskin shirt and, casting it aside,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood naked to the hips. The tumult ceased</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As, panting hard, the voyageurs released</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their struggling charge and, ducking to a swing</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of those freed arms, sought safety, scampering.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fink also stripped his shirt; and as the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stood thus revealed, a buzz of wonder ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the jostling rabble. Few there were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who in that moment envied Carpenter,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely poised and waiting placid browed:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For shall a lonely cedar brave a cloud</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bulged big and shapen to the cyclone’s whirl?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lo, even as the body of a girl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The body of the blond was smooth and white;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But vaguely, as one guesses at the might</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of silent waters running swift and deep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One guessed what stores of power lay asleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the long fleet lines of trunk and limb.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus God had made experiment with him;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, groping for the old Adamic dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had found his patterns in the tree and stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Fink’s in whirling air and hungry flame.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now momently the picture there became</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A blur of speed. Mike rushed. The tiptoe town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Craned eagerly to see a man go down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that human thunder gust. But lo!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As bends a sapling when the great winds blow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other squatted, deftly swayed aside,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over him the slashing blows went wide.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink sprawled. But hardly had a spreading roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>O’errun the town, when silence as before</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Possessed the scene; for Mike flashed back again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With flamelike speed, and suddenly the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Clenched, leaning neck to neck.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i17">Without a word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like horn-locked bulls that strive before the herd,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They balanced might with might; till Mike’s hands whipped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the other’s arm-pits, met and gripped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the broad white shoulders. Then began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The whole prodigious engine of the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bulge and roll and darken with the strain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like rivulets fed suddenly with rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tall one’s thews rose ropily and flowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Converging might against the growing load</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of those tremendous arms that strove to crush.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Their labored breathing whistled in the hush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One saw the blond man’s face go bluish red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As deeper, deeper sank Fink’s shaggy head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid his heaped-up shoulder brawn. One knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That very soon the taller of the two</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Must yield and take that terrible embrace.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A tense hypnotic quiet filled the place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The men were like two wrestlers in a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That holds an endless moment; till a scream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell stab-like on the hush. One saw Talbeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Jaws set, hands clenched, eyes wild, and bending low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though he too were struggling, slowly bowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath Fink’s might. And then⁠—</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">What ailed the crowd?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Swept over by a flurry of surprise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They swayed and jostled, shouting battle-cries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And quips and jeers of savage merriment.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One moment they had seen the tall man bent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About to break: then, falling back a-haunch,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His feet had plunged against the other’s paunch</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sent Fink somersaulting.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A silence fell as, leaping up, the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were mingled briefly in a storm of blows.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now, tripping like a dancer on his toes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blond man sparred; while, like a baited bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half blinded with the lust to crush and tear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink strove to clutch that something lithe and sleek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That stung and fled and stung. Upon his cheek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flying shadow laid a vivid bruise;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Another⁠—and his brow began to ooze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Slow drops that spattered on his bearded jaw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Again that shadow passed⁠—his mouth went raw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And like a gunshot wound it gaped and bled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fink roared with rage and plunged with lowered head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon this thing that tortured, hurled it back</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the crowd. One heard a thud and smack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rapid blows on bone and flesh⁠—and then</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One saw the tall man stagger clear again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With gushing nostrils and a bloody grin,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And down his front the whiteness of the skin</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was striped with flowing crimson to the waist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unsteadily he wheeled about and faced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The headlong hate of his antagonist.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now toe to toe and fist to flying fist,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They played at give and take; and all the while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The blond man smiled that riddle of a smile,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As one who meditates upon a jest.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yet surely he was losing! Backward pressed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He strove in vain to check his raging foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink lunged and straightened to a shoulder blow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With force enough to knock a bison down.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other dodged it, squatting. Then the town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Discovered what a smile might signify.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For, even as the futile blow went by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One saw the lithe white form shoot up close in,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hooked white arm jab upward to the chin⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once⁠—twice⁠—and yet again. With eyes astare,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His hands aloft and clutching at the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink tottered backward, limply lurched and fell.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then came to pass what stilled the rabble’s yell,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So strange it was. And ’round the fires that night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wisest warriors, talking of the fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could not explain what happened at the end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No friend, they said, makes war upon a friend;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor does a foe have pity on a foe:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yet the tall white chief had bathed with snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bloody mouth and battered cheek and brow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of him who fell!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">Queer people, anyhow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Long Knives were⁠—and hard to understand!</span>

						<p epub:type="title">The Shooting of the Cup</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span>Bull-roaring March had swept across the land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the evangelic goose and crane,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Forerunners of the messianic Rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went crying through the wilderness aloft.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fog hid the sun, and yet the snow grew soft.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The monochrome of sky and poplar bough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drab tracery on drab, was stippled now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With swelling buds; and slushy water ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the ice-bound river that began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stir and groan as one about to wake.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now, while they waited for the ice to break,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trappers fashioned bull-boats⁠—willow wrought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bowl-like frames, and over these drawn taut</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Green bison hides with bison sinew sewn.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And much they talked about the Yellowstone:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How fared their comrades yonder since the fall?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And would they marvel at the goodly haul</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of beaver pelts these crazy craft should bring?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And what of Ashley starting north that spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With yet another hundred? Did his prows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already nose the flood?⁠—Ah, cherry boughs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis now were loud with bees</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And white with bloom; and wading to the knees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The cattle browsed along the fresh green sloughs!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yes, even now the leaning cordelle crews</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With word from home (so far away, alas!)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Led north the marching armies of the grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere the heart of Summertime they towed!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>So while they shaped the willow frames and sewed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bison hides, the trappers’ hearts were light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They talked no longer now about the fight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That story, shaped and fitted part by part,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unwittingly was rounded into art,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, being art, already it was old.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When this bleak time should seem the age of gold,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These men, grown gray and garrulous, might tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wondrous doings on the Musselshell⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How Carpenter, the mighty, fought, and how</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Great Fink went down. But spring was coming now,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And who’s for backward looking in the spring?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Yet one might see that Mike still felt the sting</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of that defeat; for often he would brood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Himself the center of a solitude</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wherein the friendly chatter of the band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a wind that makes a lonely land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seem lonelier. And much it grieved Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To see a haughty comrade humbled so;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, even more, he feared what wounded pride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might bring to pass, before their boats could ride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dawnward reaches of the April floods</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And leave behind the village of the Bloods;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now it seemed a curse was on the place.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau was like a man who views a race</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With all to lose: so slowly crept the spring,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So surely crawled some formless fatal thing,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He knew not what it was. But should it win,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Life could not be again as it had been</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And spring would scarcely matter any more.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The daybreak often found him at the shore,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ghostly figure in the muggy light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Intent to see what progress over night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The shackled river made against the chain.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And then at last, one night, a dream of rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came vividly upon him. How it poured!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A witch’s garden was the murk that roared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With bursting purple bloom. ’Twas April weather,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he and Mike and Bill were boys together</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the sounding shingle roof at home.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He smelled the odor of the drinking loam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still rolling mellow from the recent share;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And he could feel the meadow greening there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the apple orchard. Then he ’woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And raised the flap. A wraith of thunder-smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was trailing off along the prairie’s rim.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Half dreaming yet, the landscape puzzled him.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What made the orchard seem so tall and lean?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And surely yonder meadow had been green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moment since! What made it tawny now?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And yonder where the billows of the plow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should glisten fat and sleek⁠—?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">The drowsy spell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dropped off and left him on the Musselshell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the old familiar load of care.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He looked aloft. The stars had faded there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sky was cloudless. No, one lonely fleece</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely floated in the spacious peace</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the distance caught prophetic light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In truth he had heard thunder in the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dashing rain; for all the land was soaked,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where the withered drifts had lingered, smoked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The naked soil. But since the storm was gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How strange that still low thunder mumbled on⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An unresolving cadence marred at whiles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By dull explosions! Now for miles and miles</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the vale he saw a trail of steam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That marked the many windings of the stream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the river simmered. Then he knew.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It was the sound of April breaking through!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The resurrection thunder had begun!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ice was going out, and spring had won</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The creeping race with dread!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">His ringing cheers</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Brought out the blinking village by the ears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To share the news; and though they could not know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What ecstasy of triumph moved Talbeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Yet lodge on lodge took up the joyous cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That set the dogs intoning to the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drenched cayuses shrilly nickering.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So man and beast proclaimed the risen Spring</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the Musselshell.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">And all day long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The warring River sang its ocean song.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that night the spirits of the rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made battle music with a shattered chain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And raged upon the foe. And did one gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon that struggle through the starry haze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One saw enormous bodies heaved and tossed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where stubbornly the Yotuns of the Frost</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With shoulder set to shoulder strove to stem</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wild invasion rolling over them.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor in the morning was the struggle done.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely all that day the doughty Sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A banished king returning to his right,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld his legions pouring to the fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Exhaustless; and his cavalries that rode⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hoofs that rumbled and with manes that flowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>White in the war gust⁠—crashing on the foe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all that night the din of overthrow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose to heaven from the stricken field;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sound as of the shock of spear and shield,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of wheels that trundled and the feet of hordes,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of shrieking horses mad among the swords,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hurrahing of attackers and attacked,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sounds as of a city that is sacked</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When lust for loot runs roaring through the night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dawn looked upon no battle, but a flight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the next day broke, the spring flood flowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some great host that takes the homeward road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many spoils⁠—a glad triumphal march,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of which the turquoise heaven was the arch.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now comes a morning when the tents are down</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And packed for travel; and the whole Blood town</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is out along the waterfront to see</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trappers going. Dancing as with glee,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Six laden bull-boats feel the April tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sweep away. Along the riverside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The straggling, shouting rabble keeps abreast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little while; but, longer than the rest,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A weeping runner races with the swirl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And loses slowly. ’Tis the Long Knife’s girl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom love perhaps already makes aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How flows unseen a greater river there⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The never-to-be-overtaken days.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now she pauses at the bend to gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the black boats dwindling down the long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dawn-gilded reach. A merry trapper’s song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Comes liltingly to mock her, and a hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Waves back farewell. Now ’round a point of land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The bull-boats disappear; and that is all⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save only that long waiting for the fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he would come again.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">All day they swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Northeastwardly. The undulating world</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flowed by them⁠—wooded headland, greening vale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And naked hill⁠—as in a fairy tale</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembered in a dream. And when the flare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of sunset died behind them, and the air</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went weird and deepened to a purple gloom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw the white Enchanted Castles loom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above them, slowly pass and drift a-rear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dissolving in the starry crystal sphere</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>’Mid which they seemed suspended.</span>
							<span>Late to camp,</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They launched while yet the crawling valley damp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made islands of the distant hills and hid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The moaning flood. The Half Way Pyramid</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That noon stared in upon them from the south.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas starlight when they camped at Hell Creek’s mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among those hills where evermore in vain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Spring comes wooing, and the April rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is tears upon a tomb. And once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dead land echoed to the songs of men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bound dayward when the dawn was but a streak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Halfway to noon they sighted Big Dry Creek,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not choked with grave dust now, but carolling</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The universal music of the spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then when the day was midway down the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They reached the Milk. And howsoe’er the eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might sweep that valley with a far-flung gaze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It found no spot uncovered with a maze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of bison moving lazily at browse⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scarce wilder than a herd of dairy cows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That know their herdsman.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Now the whole band willed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tarry. So they beached their boats and killed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Three fading heifers; sliced the juicy rumps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For broiling over embers; set the humps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And loins to roast on willow spits, and threw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hearts and livers in a pot to stew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the time of dulling appetites.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the stream ran opalescent lights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in a scarlet glow the new moon set,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The feast began. And some were eating yet,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some again in intervals of sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When upside down above the polar steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Dipper hung. And many tales were told</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was hearty laughter as of old,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Fink’s guffaw to swell it now and then.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed old times were coming back again;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That truly they had launched upon a trip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereof the shining goal was comradeship:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tears were in the laughter of Talbeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So glad was he. For how may mortals know</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their gladness, save they sense it by the fear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That whispers how the very thing held dear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May pass away?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">The smoky dawn was lit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, suddenly become aware of it,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A flock of blue cranes, dozing on the sand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With startled cries awoke the sprawling band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And took the misty air with moaning wings.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Disgruntled with the chill drab scheme of things,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still half asleep and heavy with the feast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trappers launched their boats. But when the east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Burned rosily, therefrom a raw wind blew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ever with the growing day it grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the stream rose choppily and drove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fleet ashore. Camped snugly in a grove</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of cottonwoods, they slept. And when the gale,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Together with the light, began to fail,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They ’rose and ate and set adrift again.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It seemed the solid world that mothers men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With twilight and the falling moon had passed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was nothing but a hollow vast,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By time-outlasting stars remotely lit,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And they who at the central point of it</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung motionless; while, rather sensed than seen,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The phantoms of a world that had been green</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stole by in silence⁠—shapes that once were trees,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Black wraiths of bushes, airy traceries</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Remembering the hills. Then sleep made swift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The swinging of the Dipper and the lift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of stars that dwell upon the day’s frontier;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until at length the wheeling hollow sphere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to fill. And just at morning-shine</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They landed at the Little Porcupine.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Again they slept and, putting off at night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They passed the Elk Horn Prairie on the right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Halfway to dawn and Wolf Creek. One night more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had vanished when they slept upon the shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the Poplar’s mouth. And three had fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When, black against the early morning red,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Fort that Henry builded heard their calls,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sentries’ rifles spurting from the walls</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Spilled drawling echoes. Then the gates swung wide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And shouting trappers thronged the riverside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To welcome back the homing voyageurs.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>That day was spent in sorting out the furs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With eager talk of how the winter went;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with the growing night grew merriment.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hump and haunches of a bison cow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Hung roasting at the heaped-up embers now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On Henry’s hearth. The backlog whined and popped</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, sitting squat or lounging elbow-propped,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shrewd traders in the merchandise of tales</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Held traffic, grandly careless how the scales</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tiptilted with a slight excessive weight.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the roast was finished, how they ate!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there was that which set them singing too</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the deep bass music of the flue,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While catgut screamed ecstatic in the lead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Encouraging the voices used and keyed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To vast and windy spaces.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Later came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gentler mood when, staring at the flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Men ventured reminiscences and spoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About Kentucky people or the folk</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Back yonder in Virginia or the ways</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They knew in old <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis; till the blaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell blue upon the hearth, and in the gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And melancholy stillness of the room</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard the wind of midnight wail outside.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then there was one who poked the logs and cried:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Is this a weeping drunk? I swear I’m like</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To tear my hair! Sing something lively, Mike!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Fink said nought; but after poring long</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the logs, began an Irish song⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gently grieving thing like April rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That while it wakes old memories of pain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wakes also odors of the violet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A broken heart, it seemed, could ne’er forget</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The eyes of Nora, dead upon the hill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when he ceased the men sat very still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As hearing yet the low caressing note</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of some lost angel mourning in his throat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And afterwhile Mike spoke: “Shure, now,” said he,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“ ’Tis in a woman’s eyes shtrong liquors be;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if ye drink av thim⁠—and if ye drink⁠—”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For just a moment in the face of Fink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau beheld that angel yearning through;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And wondering if Carpenter saw too,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He looked, and lo! the guileless fellow⁠—grinned!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>As dreaming water, stricken by a wind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gives up the imaged heaven that it knows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So Fink’s face lost the angel. He arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And left the place without a word to say.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The morrow was a perfect April day;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor might one guess⁠—so friendly was the sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So kind the air⁠—what thread at length was spun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What shears were opened now to sever it.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No sullen mood was Mike’s. His biting wit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Made gay the trappers busy with the fur;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though more and ever more on Carpenter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His sallies fell, with ever keener whet.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Carpenter, unskilled in banter, met</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sharper sally with the broader grin.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But, by and by, Mike made a jest, wherein</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some wanton innuendo lurked and leered,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About the Long Knife’s girl. The place went weird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sudden silence as the tall man strode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the room, nor lacked an open road</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the men. A glitter in his stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Belied the smile he bore; and, pausing there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With stiffened index finger raised and held</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before the jester’s eyes, as though he spelled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The slow words out, he said: “We’ll have no jokes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In just that way about our women folks!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Fink guffawed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">They would have fought again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had not the Major stepped between the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And talked the crisis by. And when ’twas past,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau, intent to end the strife at last,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Somehow persuaded Fink to make amends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, as a proof that henceforth they were friends,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Proposed the shooting of the whisky cup.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Shure, b’y,” said Mike, “we’ll toss a copper up</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And if ’tis heads I’ll thry me cunning first.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As fer me joke, the tongue of me is cursed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wid double j’ints⁠—so let it be forgot!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And so it was agreed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">They cleared a spot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flipped a coin that tinkled as it fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A tiny sound⁠—yet, like a midnight bell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sets wild faces pressing at the pane,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau would often hear that coin again,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vivid dreams, to waken terrified.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas heads.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">And now the tall man stepped aside</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, beckoning Talbeau, he whispered: “Son,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If anything should happen, keep my gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For old time’s sake. And when the Major pays</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In old <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis, drink to better days</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When friends were friends, with what he’s owing me.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat the little man laughed merrily</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And said: “Old Horse, you’re off your feed today;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But if you’ve sworn an oath to blow your pay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I guess the three of us can make it good!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike couldn’t miss a target if he would.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Well, maybe so,” said Carpenter, and smiled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A windless noon was brooding on the wild</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the clearing, eager for the show,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The waiting trappers chatted. Now Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Stepped off the range. The tall man took his place,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grin of some droll humor on his face;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when his friend was reaching for his head</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To set the brimming cup thereon, he said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“You won’t forget I gave my gun to you</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all my blankets and my fixin’s too?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The small man laughed and, turning round, he cried:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“We’re ready, Mike!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">A murmur ran and died</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the double line of eager men.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink raised his gun, but set it down again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And blew a breath and said: “I’m gittin’ dhry!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So howld yer noddle shtiddy, Bill, me b’y,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And don’t ye shpill me whisky!” Cedar-straight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tall man stood, the calm of brooding Fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About him. Aye, and often to the end</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau would see that vision of his friend⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A man-flower springing from the fresh green sod,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>While, round about, the bushes burned with God</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And mating peewees fluted in the brush.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They heard a gun lock clicking in the hush.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw Fink sighting⁠—heard the rifle crack,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw beneath the spreading powder rack</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The tall man pitching forward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Echoes fled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like voices in a panic. Then Mike said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Bejasus, and yeVe shpilled me whisky, Bill!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A catbird screamed. The crowd stood very still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though bewitched.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">“And can’t ye hear?” bawled Fink;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I say, I’m dhry⁠—and now ye’ve shpilled me drink!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He stooped to blow the gasses from his gun.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>And now men saw Talbeau. They saw him run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And stoop to peer upon the prostrate man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where now the mingling blood and whisky ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From oozing forehead and the tilted cup.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the hush a sobbing cry grew up:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“My God! You’ve killed him, Mike!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">Then growing loud,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A wind of horror blew among the crowd</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And set it swirling round about the dead.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And over all there roared a voice that said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I niver mint to do it, b’ys, I swear!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The divil’s in me gun!” Men turned to stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wild-eyed upon the center of that sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw Fink dash his rifle to the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere the hated body of his wrong.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Once more arose that wailing, like a song,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one who called and called upon his friend.</span>

					<p>
						<span>It seemed the end, and yet ’twas not the end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A day that wind of horror and surprise</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blew high; and then, as when the tempest dies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And only aspens prattle, as they will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though pines win silence and the oaks are still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By furtive twos and threes the talk survived.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To some it seemed that men were longer lived</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who quarreled not over women. Others guessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That love was bad for marksmanship at best⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The nerves, you know! Still others pointed out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why Mike should have the benefit of doubt;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For every man, who knew a rifle, knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That there were days you’d split a reed in two,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Off-hand at fifty paces; then, one day,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Why, somehow, damn your eyes, you’d blaze away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And miss a bull! No doubt regarding that!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“But,” one replied, “ ’tis what you’re aiming at,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Not what you hit, determines skill, you know!”⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An abstract observation, apropos</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of nothing in particular, but made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As just a contribution to the trade</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of gunnery! And others would recall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The center of that silence in the hall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The night one lay there waiting, splendid, still,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nothing left to wait for. Poor old Bill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There went a man, by God! Who knew his like⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So meek in might? And some remembered Mike⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The hearth-lit room⁠—the way he came to look</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon that face⁠—and how his shoulders shook</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With sobbing as he moaned: “My friend! My friend!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>It seemed the end, and yet ’twas not the end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Though men cared less to know what cunning gnome</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or eyeless thing of doom had ridden home</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deadly slug. And then there came a day</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Major Henry had a word to say</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed, at last, to lay the ghost to rest.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He meant to seek the River of the West</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the range, immensely rich in furs,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And for the wiving prows of voyageurs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A virgin yearning. Yonder one might glide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A thousand miles to sunset, where the tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is tempered with an endless dream of May!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So much and more the Major had to say⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Words big with magic for the young men’s ears.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And finally he called for volunteers⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Two men to hasten to the Moreau’s mouth,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Meet Ashley’s party coming from the south</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bid them buy more horses at the Grand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the Rees. Then, pushing through the band,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike Fink stood forth, and after him, Talbeau.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now Henry thought ’twere wiser they should go</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By land, although the river trail, he knew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were better. But a wind of rumor blew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Up stream. About the region of the Knife,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, the Grovans tarried, nursing strife</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Because the Whites were favoring their foes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With trade for guns; and, looking on their bows,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Grovans hated. So the rumor said.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And thus it came to pass the new trail led</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About six days by pony to the south;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thence eastward, five should find the Moreau’s mouth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Ashley toiling up among the bars.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The still white wind was blowing out the stars</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When yawning trappers saw the two men row</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the river with their mounts in tow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A red roan stallion and a buckskin mare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the ponies gain the far bank there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And flounder up and shake themselves like dogs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the riders mount and breast the fogs</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flung down as wool upon the flat. They dip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rise and float, submerging to the hip,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Turn slowly into shadow men, and fade.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And some have said that when the ponies neighed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas like a strangled shriek; and far ahead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some ghostly pony, ridden by the dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Called onward like a bugle singing doom.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the valley floor, as with a broom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was swept by dawn, men saw the empty land.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Not now the Song shall tell of Henry’s band</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ascending to the Falls, nor how they crossed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The Blackfoot trail, nor how they fought and lost,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thrown back upon the Yellowstone to wait</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In vain for Ashley’s hundred. Yonder, Fate</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Led southward through the fog, and thither goes</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prescient Song.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">The April sun arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fell; and all day long the riders faced</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A rolling, treeless, melancholy waste</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of yellow grass; for ’twas a rainless time,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor had the baby green begun to climb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The steep-kneed hills, but kept the nursing draws.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knee to knee they rode with scarce a pause,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save when the ponies drank; and scarce a word,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the haunting silence of a third,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Who rode between them, shackled either tongue.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when along the sloughs the twilight flung</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blue haze, and made the hills seem doubly bleak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They camped beside a songless little creek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That crawled among the clumps of stunted plum</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just coming into bud. And both sat dumb</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside a mewing fire, until the west</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was darkened and the shadows leaped and pressed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About their little ring of feeble light.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, moved by some vague menace in the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink forced a laugh that wasn’t glad at all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And joked about a certain saddle gall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That troubled him⁠—a Rabelaisian quip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That in the good old days had served to strip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The drooping humor from the dourest jowl.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He heard the laughter of the prairie owl,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A goblin jeering. Gazing at the flame,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau seemed not to hear. But when there came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A cry of kiotes, peering all about</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He said: “You don’t suppose they’ll dig him out?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I carried heavy stones till break of day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>You don’t suppose they’ll come and paw away</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The heavy stones I packed, and pester Bill?”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Huh uh,” Fink grunted; but the evening chill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed doubled on a sudden; so he sought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His blanket, wrapped it closely, thought and thought</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till drowsy nonsense tumbled through his skull.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now at that time of night when comes a lull</span>
						<br/>
						<span>On stormy life; when even sorrow sleeps,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And sentinels upon the stellar steeps</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sight morning, though the world is blind and dumb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink wakened at a whisper: “Mike! He’s come!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Look! Look!” And Mike sat up and blinked and saw.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It didn’t walk⁠—it burned along the draw⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tall, radiantly white! It wasn’t dead⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It smiled⁠—it had a tin cup on its head⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eh?⁠—Gone!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Fink stirred the embers to a flare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What dream was this? The world seemed unaware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That anything at all had come to pass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Contentedly the ponies nipped the grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There in the darkness; and the night was still.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They slept no more, but nursed the fire until</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The morning broke; then ate and rode away.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They weren’t any merrier that day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each spoke little, save when Fink would swear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And smirch the virtue of the buckskin mare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For picking quarrels with the roan he rode.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(Did not the Northwind nag her like a goad,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And was there any other horse to blame?)</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The worried day dragged on and twilight came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A dusty gray. They climbed a hill to seek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some purple fringe of brush that marked a creek.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie seemed an endless yellow blur:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor might they choose but tarry where they were</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pass the cheerless night as best they could,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For they had seen no water-hole or wood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Since when the sun was halfway down the sky;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And there would be no stars to travel by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So thick a veil of dust the great wind wove.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They staked their ponies in a leeward cove,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, rolling in their blankets, swooned away.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau awoke and stared. ’Twas breaking day!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So soon? It seemed he scarce had slept a wink!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d have another snooze, for surely Fink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed far from waking, sprawled upon the ground,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His loose mouth gaping skyward with a sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As of a bucksaw grumbling through a knot.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau dropped back and dreamed the sun was hot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his face. He tried but failed to stir;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whereat he knew that he was Carpenter</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hot-breatht wolves were sniffing round his head!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He wasn’t dead! He really wasn’t dead!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would no one come, would no one drive them off?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His cry for help was nothing but a cough,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For something choked him. Then a shrill long scream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cut knife-like through the shackles of his dream,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And once again he saw the lurid flare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of morning on the hills.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">What ailed the mare?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>She strained her tether, neighing. And the roan?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He squatted, trembling, with his head upthrown,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And lashed his tail and snorted at the blast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps some prowling grizzly wandered past.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau sat up. What stifling air! How warm!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What sound was that? Perhaps a thunder storm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was working up. He coughed; and then it broke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon him how the air was sharp with smoke;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, leaping up, he turned and looked and knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What birdless dawn, unhallowed by the dew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came raging from the northwest! Half the earth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And half the heavens were a burning hearth</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fed fat with grass inflammable as tow!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shook Fink, yelling: “Mike, we’ve got to go!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>All hell’s broke loose!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">They cinched the saddles on</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With hands that fumbled; mounted and were gone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like rabbits fleeing from a kiote pack.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They crossed the valley, topped a rise, looked back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor dared to gaze. The firm, familiar world,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, was melting down, and Chaos swirled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more across the transient realms of form</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To scatter in the primal atom-storm</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The earth’s rich dust and potency of dreams.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Infernal geysers gushed, and sudden streams</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of rainbow flux went roaring up the skies</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through ghastly travesties of Paradise,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where, drowsy in a tropic summertide,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strange gaudy flowers bloomed and aged and died⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whole seasons in a moment. Bloody rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blown slant like April silver, spewed the plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To mock the fallow sod; and where it fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Anemones and violets of hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Foreran the fatal summer.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Spurs bit deep.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now down the hill where shadow-haunted sleep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fell from the broken wind’s narcotic breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ponies plunged. A sheltered draw, where death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed brooding in the silence, heard them pass.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hollow, deep with tangled jointed grass,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Snatched at the frantic hoofs. Now up a slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They clambered, blowing, at a stumbling lope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, reined upon the summit, wheeled to stare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stallion snorted, and the rearing mare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Screamed at the sight and bolted down the wind.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The writhing Terror, scarce a mile behind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Appeared to gain; while far to left and right</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its flanks seemed bending in upon the night⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A ten-league python closing on its prey.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No guiding hand was needed for the way;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blind speed was all. So little Nature heeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fate of men, these blew as tumbleweeds</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that dwarfing, elemental rage.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A gray wolf bounded from a clump of sage;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A rabbit left its bunchgrass nest and ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside its foe; and neither dreaded Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deadliest of all earth’s preying things.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A passing knoll exploded into wings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And prairie owls, befuddled by the light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went tumbling up like patches of the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The burning tempest tattered.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Leaning low,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gasping riders let the ponies go,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The little buckskin leading, while the roan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Strove hard a-flank, afraid to be alone</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And nickering at whiles. And he who led,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By brief hypnotic lapses comforted,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Recalled the broad Ohio, heard the horns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The way they used to sing those summer morns</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When he and Mike and⁠—. There the dream went wrong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And through his head went running, like a song</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That sings itself: “He tried so hard to come</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And warn us; but the grave had made him dumb,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ’twas to show he loved us that he smiled.”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And of the other terror made a child</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Whom often, for a panic moment’s span,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Projections from the conscience of the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Pursued with glaring eyes and claws of flame.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For this the dead arose, for this he came⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That grin upon his face!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">A blinding gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crushed down; then, followed by a rolling boom,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There broke a scarlet hurricane of light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That swept the farthest reaches of the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where unsuspected hills leaped up aghast.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Already through the hollow they had passed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So recently, the hounding Terror sped!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now the wind grew hotter. Overhead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Inverted seas of color rolled and broke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from the combers of the litten smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stinging spindrift showered.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">On they went,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unconscious of duration or extent,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of everything but that from which they fled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now, sloping to an ancient river bed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The prairie flattened. Plunging downward there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The riders suddenly became aware</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How surged, beneath, a mighty shadow-stream⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though the dying Prairie dreamed a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of yesterage when all her valleys flowed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With Amazons, and monster life abode</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon her breast and quickened in her womb.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And from that rushing in the flame-smeared gloom</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Unnumbered outcries blended in a roar.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The headlong ponies struck the sounding shore</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And reared upon their haunches. Far and near,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valley was a-flood with elk and deer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And buffalo and wolves and antelope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And whatsoever creature slough and slope</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the path of terror had to give.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Torrential with the common will to live,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The river of unnumbered egos swept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The ponies with it. But the buckskin kept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The margin where the rabble frayed and thinned</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, breathing with the wheeze of broken wind,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The stallion clung to her.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">It came to pass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valley yawned upon a sea of grass</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That seemed to heave, as waves of gloom and glare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran over it; and, rising here and there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tall buttes made islands in the living tide</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That roared about them. Still with swinging stride</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And rhythmic breath the little buckskin ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the herd, that opened like a fan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And scattered. But the roan was losing ground.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His breathing gave a gurgling, hollow sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though his life were gushing from his throat.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His whole frame quivered like a scuttled boat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That slowly sinks; nor did he seem to feel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his flank the biting of the steel</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That made him bleed. Fink cut the rifle-boot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saddle-bags away, to give the brute</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Less burden.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Now it happened, as they neared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A lofty butte whose summit glimmered weird</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beneath the lurid boiling of the sky,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau was startled by a frantic cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind him; noted that he rode alone,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, turning in the saddle, saw the roan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go stumbling down and wither to a heap.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And momently, between a leap and leap,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The love of self was mighty in the man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For now the Terror left the hills and ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With giant strides along the grassy plains.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dear Yesterdays fought wildly for the reins,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Tomorrows for the spur. And then the mare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heeled to the sawing bit and pawed the air</span>
						<br/>
						<span class="dl2">
							<span>And halted, prancing.</span>
							<span>Once again Talbeau</span>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Looked back to where the sparks were blown as snow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before that blizzard blast of scorching light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw Fink running down the painted night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Like some lost spirit fleeing from the Wrath.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>One horse⁠—and who should ride it? All he hath</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A man will give for life! But shall he give</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For living that which makes it good to live⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The consciousness of fellowship and trust?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let fools so prize a pinch of throbbing dust!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now Fink should ride, and let the rest be hid.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He bounded from the mare; but, as he did,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The panic-stricken pony wheeled about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Won freedom with a lunge, and joined the rout</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of fleeing shadows.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Well, ’twas over now⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps it didn’t matter anyhow⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They’d go together now and hunt for Bill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And momently the world seemed very still</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About Talbeau. Then Fink was at his side,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Blank horror in his face. “Come on!” he cried;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“The butte! We’ll climb the butte!” And once again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau knew fear.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Now, gripping hands, the men</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Scuttled and dodged athwart the scattered flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of shapes that drifted in the flood of light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A living flotsam; reached the bare butte’s base,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Went scrambling up its leaning leeward face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where the slope grew sheer, and huddled there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hotter, hotter, hotter grew the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until their temples sang a fever tune.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The April night became an August noon.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then, near to swooning in a blast of heat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They heard the burning breakers boom and beat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About their lofty island, as they lay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Their gaping mouths pressed hard against the clay,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And fought for every breath. Nor could they tell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How long upon a blistered scarp in hell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They gasped and clung. But suddenly at last⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An age in passing, and a moment, passed⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The torture ended, and the cool air came;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, looking out, they saw the long slant flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Devour the night to leeward.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">By and by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Drab light came seeping through the sullen sky.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They waited there until the morning broke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, like a misty moon amid the smoke,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sun came stealing up.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">They found a place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where rain had scarred the butte wall’s western face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With many runnels; clambered upward there⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And viewed a panorama of despair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The wind had died, and not a sound arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above those blackened leagues; for even crows</span>
						<br/>
						<span>(The solitude embodied in a bird)</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fled that desolation. Nothing stirred,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Save here and there a thin gray column grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>From where some draw still smouldered. And they knew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How universal quiet may appal</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As violence, and, even as a wall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sheer vacancy confine.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">No horse, no gun!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nay, worse; no hint of water hole or run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In all the flat or back among the hills!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mere hunger is a goad that, ere it kills,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>May drive the lean far down the hardest road:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But thirst is both a snaffle and a load;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It gripped them now. When Mike made bold to speak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His tongue was like a stranger to his cheek.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Shure, b’y,” he croaked; “ ’tis Sunday morn in hell!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The sound seemed profanation; on it fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The vast, rebuking silence.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Long they gazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About them, standing silent and amazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the summit. West and north and east</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They saw too far. But mystery, at least,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was in the south, where still the smoke concealed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The landscape. Vistas of the unrevealed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Invited Hope to stray there as it please.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And presently there came a little breeze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Out of the dawn. As of a crowd that waits</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some imminent revealment of the Fates</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That toil behind the scenes, a murmur ’woke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the hollow hush. And now the smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mysteriously stirs, begins to flow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And giant shadow bulks that loom below</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seem crowding dawnward. One by one they lift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the reek, and trail the ragged drift</span>
						<br/>
						<span>About their flanks. A melancholy scene!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gray buttes and giddy gulfs that yawn between⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A Titan’s labyrinth! But see afar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where yonder canyon like a purple scar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cuts zigzag through the waste! Is that a gleam</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of water in its deeps?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">A stream! A stream!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now scrambling down the runnels of the rain,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They struck across the devastated plain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where losers of the night’s mad race were strewn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To wait the wolves and crows.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Mid-afternoon</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beheld them stripping at the river’s bank.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wallowed in the turbid stream and drank</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Delicious beakers in the liquid mud;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor drank alone, for here the burning flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had flung its panting driftage in the dark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The valley teemed with life, as though some Ark</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That rode the deluge, spewed its cargo here:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Elk, antelope, wolves, bison, rabbits, deer,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Owls, crows⁠—the greatest mingled with the least.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when the men had drunk, they had a feast</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of liver, bolted dripping from a cow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dead at the water’s lip.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Blue shadow now</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was mounting slowly up the canyon steep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So, seeking for a better place to sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They wandered down the margin of the stream.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas scarce more real than walking in a dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of lonely craters in a lunar land</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That never thrilled with roots. On either hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dwarfing summits soared, grotesque, austere,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And jagged fissures, sentinelled with fear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Led back to mysteries of purple gloom.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>They came to where a coulee, like a flume,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rose steeply to the prairie. Thither hurled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A roaring freshet of the herd had swirled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Cascading to the river bed; and there,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the trampelled carcasses, the mare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lay bloated near the water. She had run</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With saddle, panniers, powder-horn and gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Against the wind-thewed fillies of the fire,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And won the heat, to perish at the wire⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A plucky little brute!</span>

						<p epub:type="title">Vengeance</p>
					</hgroup>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">They made a camp</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Well up above the crawling valley damp,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And where no prowling beast might chance to come.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>There was no fuel; but a flask of rum,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thanks to the buckskin, dulled the evening chill.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And both grew mellow. Memories of Bill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And other nights possessed the little man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on and on his reminiscence ran,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As ’twere the babble of a brook of tears</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Gone groping for the ocean of dead years</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Too far away to reach. And by and by</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The low voice sharpened to an anguished cry:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“O Mike! I said you couldn’t miss the cup!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then something snapped in Fink and, leaping up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seized Talbeau and shook him as a rat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Is shaken by a dog. “Enough of that!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He yelled; “And, ’faith, Til sind ye afther Bill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Per wan more wurrd! Ye fool! I mint to kill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, moind me now, ye’d better howld yer lip!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau felt murder shudder in the grip</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That choked and shook and flung him. Faint and dazed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He sprawled upon the ground. And anger blazed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within him, like the leaping Northern Light</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That gives no heat. He wished to rise and fight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But could not for the horror of it all.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Wild voices thronged the further canyon wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As Fink raved on; and every word he said</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like a mutilation of the dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>By some demonic mob.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">And when at length</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He heard Mike snoring yonder, still the strength</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To rise and kill came not upon Talbeau.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So many moments of the Long Ago</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came pleading; and the gentle might thereof</span>
						<br/>
						<span>United with the habit of old love</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To weave a spell about the sleeping man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Then drowsily the pondered facts began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To merge and group, as running colors will,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In new and vaguer patterns. Mike and Bill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were bickering again. And someone said:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Let’s flip a copper; if it’s tails, he’s dead;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If heads, he’s living. That’s the way to tell!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A spinning copper jangled like a bell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But even as he stooped to pick it up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behold! the coin became a whisky cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bored smoothly through the center! “Look at this!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He seemed to shout: “I knew Mike couldn’t miss!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bill only played at dying for a joke!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Then laughter filled his dream, and he awoke.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The dawn was like a stranger’s cold regard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the lifeless land, grotesquely scarred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As by old sorrow; and the man’s dull sense</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of woe, become objective and immense,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed waiting there to crush him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i19">Fink still slept;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And even now, it seemed, his loose mouth kept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A shape for shameless words, as though a breath,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Deep drawn, might set it gloating o’er the death</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of one who loved its jesting and its song.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And while Talbeau sat pondering the wrong</span>
						<br/>
						<span>So foully done, and all that had been killed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And how the laughter of the world was stilled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And all its wine poured out, he seemed to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though a spirit whispered in his ear:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<em>You won’t forget I gave my gun to you!</em>
						</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And instantly the deep conviction grew</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That ’twas a plea for justice from the slain.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ah, not without a hand upon the rein,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor with an empty saddle, had the mare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Outrun the flame that she might carry there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The means of vengeance!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i14">Yet⁠—if Mike were dead!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shuddered, gazing where the gray sky bled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With morning, like a wound. He couldn’t kill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did it seem to be the way of Bill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To bid him do it. Yet the gun was sent.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what?⁠—To make Mike suffer and repent?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But how?</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i5">Awhile his apathetic gaze</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Explored yon thirst- and hunger-haunted maze,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As though he might surprise the answer there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The answer came. That region of despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should be Mike’s Purgatory! More than Chance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had fitted circumstance to circumstance</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That this should be! He knew it! And the plan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Thus suddenly conceived, possessed the man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed the might of Bill had been reborn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i4">He took the gun and powder horn,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The water flasks and sun-dried bison meat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The panniers gave; then climbing to a seat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the sleeper, shouted down to him:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Get up!” Along the further canyon rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A multitude of voices swelled the shout.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink started up and yawned and looked about,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Bewildered. Once again the clamor ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the canyon wall. The little man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now squinting down the pointed rifle, saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The lifted face go pale, the stubborn jaw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Droop nervelessly. A twinge of pity stirred</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Within him, and he marvelled as he heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His own voice saying what he wished unsaid:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“It’s Bill’s own rifle pointing at your head;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go east, and think of all the wrong you’ve done!”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Fink glanced across his shoulder where the sun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Shone level on the melancholy land;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, feigning that he didn’t understand,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Essayed a careless grin that went awry.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Bejasus, and we’ll not go there, me b’y,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He said; “for shure ’tis hell widout the lights!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That one-eyed stare along the rifle sights</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was narrowed to a slit. A sickening shock</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Ran through him at the clucking of the lock.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He clutched his forehead, stammering: “Talbeau,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>I’ve been yer frind⁠—.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">“I’ll give you three to go,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The other said, “or else you’ll follow Bill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>One⁠—two⁠—.”</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i7">Fink turned and scuttled down the hill;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And at the sight the watcher’s eyes grew dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For something old and dear had gone from him⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His pride in one who made a clown of Death.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Alas, how much the man would give for breath!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How easily Death made of him the clown!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Now scrambling for a grip, now rolling down,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike landed at the bottom of the steep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, plunging in the river belly deep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Struck out in terror for the other shore.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>At any moment might the rifle’s roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Crash through that rearward silence, and the lead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Come snarling like a hornet at his head⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He felt the spot! Then presently the flood</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Began to cool the fever in his blood,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And furtive self-derision stung his pride.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He clambered dripping up the further side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And felt himself a fool! He wouldn’t go!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That little whiffet yonder was Talbeau!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And who was this that he, Mike Fink, had feared?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d go and see.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i9">A spurt of smoke appeared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the river, and a bullet struck⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span><i>Spat ping</i>⁠—beside him, spewing yellow muck</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his face. Then every cliff and draw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rehearsed the sullen thunders of the law</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He dared to question. Stricken strangely weak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He clutched the clay and watched the powder reek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Trail off with glories of the level sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw Talbeau pour powder in his gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And ram the wad. A second shot might kill!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That brooding like a woman over Bill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had set the fellow daft. <em>A crazy man!</em></span>
						<br/>
						<span>The notion spurred him. Springing up, he ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To where a gully cleft the canyon rim</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And, with that one-eyed fury after him,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fled east.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i6">The very buttes, grotesque and weird,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed startled at the sight of what he feared</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And powerless to shield him in his need.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas more than man he fled from; ’twas a deed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Become alive and subtle as the air,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That turned upon the doer. Everywhere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It gibbered in the echoes as he fled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stream of pictures flitted through his head:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The quiet body in the hearth-lit hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The grinning ghost, the flight, the stallion’s fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The flame girt isle, the spectral morning sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the finding of the dead man’s gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beside the glooming river. Flowing by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>These fused and focused in the deadly eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He felt behind him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Suddenly the ground</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Heaved up and smote him with a crashing sound;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the vivid moment of his fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He thought he heard the snarling rifle ball</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And felt the one-eyed fury crunch its mark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Expectant of the swooping of the dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He raised his eyes.⁠—The sun was shining still;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It peeped about the shoulder of a hill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And viewed him with a quizzifying stare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He looked behind him. Nothing followed there;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But Silence, big with dread-begotten sound,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dismayed him; and the steeps that hemmed him round</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed plotting with a more than human guile.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He rose and fled; but every little while</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A sense of eyes behind him made him pause;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And always down the maze of empty draws</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed a sound of feet abruptly ceased.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Now trotting, walking now, he labored east;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And when at length the burning zenith beat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon him, and the summits swam with heat,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And on the winding gullies fell no shade,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He came to where converging gulches made</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A steep-walled basin for the blinding glare.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Here, fanged and famished, crawled the prickly pear;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Malevolent with thirst, the soap weed thrust</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Its barbed stilettos from the arid dust,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Defiant of the rain-withholding blue:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And in the midst a lonely scrub oak grew,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A crooked dwarf that, in the pictured bog</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of its own shadow, squatted like a frog.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fink, panting, flung himself beneath its boughs.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A mighty magic in the noonday drowse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Allayed the driving fear. A waking dream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Fulfilled a growing wish. He saw the stream</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Far off as from a space-commanding height.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And now a fantasy of rapid flight</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Transported him above the sagging land,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And with a sudden swoop he seemed to stand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more upon the shimmering river’s brink.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eyes drank deep; but when his mouth would drink,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A giant hornet from the other shore⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The generating center of a roar</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That shook the world⁠—snarled by.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">He started up,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And saw the basin filling as a cup</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With purple twilight! Gazing all around</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where still the flitting ghost of some great sound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Troubled the crags a moment, then was mute,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw along the shoulder of a butte,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A good three hundred paces from the oak,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A slowly spreading streak of rifle smoke</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And knew the deadly eye was lurking there.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He fled again.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">About him everywhere</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Amid the tangled draws now growing dim,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Weird witnesses took cognizance of him</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And told abroad the winding way he ran.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He halted only when his breath began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To stab his throat. And lo, the staring eye</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was quenched with night! No further need he fly</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Till dawn. And yet⁠—. He held his breath to hear</span>
						<br/>
						<span>If footsteps followed. Silence smote his ear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The gruesome silence of the hearth-lit hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>More dread than sound. Against the gully wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shrank and huddled with his eyes shut tight,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For fear a presence, latent in the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should walk before him.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i13">Then it seemed he ran</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Through regions alien to the feet of Man,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A weary way despite the speed of sleep,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And came upon a river flowing deep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Between black crags that made the sky a well.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And eerily the feeble starlight fell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon the flood with water lilies strown.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when he stooped, the stream began to moan,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And suddenly from every lily pad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A white face bloomed, unutterably sad</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And bloody browed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">A swift, erasing flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Across the dusky picture, morning came.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike lay a moment, blinking at the blue;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the fear of yesterday broke through</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The clinging drowse. For lo, on every side</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The paling summits watched him, Argus-eyed,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In hushed anticipation of a roar.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He fled.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i5">All day, intent to see once more</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The open plain before the night should fall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He labored on. But many a soaring wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Annulled some costly distance he had won;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And misdirected gullies, white with sun,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Seemed spitefully to baffle his desire.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The deeps went blue; on mimic dome and spire</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The daylight faded to a starry awe.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike slept; and lo, they marched along the draw⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or rather burned⁠—tall, radiantly white!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A hushed procession, tunnelling the night,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They came, with lips that smiled and brows that bled,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And each one bore a tin cup on its head,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A brimming cup. But ever as they came</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him, like a draught-struck candle flame</span>
						<br/>
						<span>They shuddered and were snuffed.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i18">’Twas deep night yet</span>
						<br/>
						<span>When Mike awoke and felt the terror sweat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon his face, the prickling of his hair.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Afraid to sleep, he paced the gully there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Until the taller buttes were growing gray.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He brooded much on flowing streams that day.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>As with a weight, he stooped; his feet were slow;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shuffled. Less and less he feared Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Behind him. More and more he feared the night</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Before him. Any hazard in the light,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Or aught that might befall ’twixt living men,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Were better than to be alone again</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And meet that dream!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i12">The deeps began to fill</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With purple haze. Bewildered, boding ill,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A moaning wind awoke. ’Twould soon be dark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike pondered. Twice Talbeau had missed the mark.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perhaps he hadn’t really meant to hit.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And surely now that flaring anger fit</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had burned away. It wasn’t like the man</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To hold a grudge. Mike halted, and began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To grope for words regretful of the dead,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Persuasive words about a heart that bled</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For Bill. ’Twas all a terrible mistake.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Plase now, a little dhrop fer owld toime’s sake!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With troublesome insistence, that refrain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Kept running through the muddle of his brain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And disarranged the words he meant to speak.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The trickle of a tear along his cheek</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Consoled him. Soon his suffering would end.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau would see him weeping for his friend⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Talbeau had water!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i10">Now the heights burned red</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To westward. With a choking clutch of dread</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He noted how the dusk was gathering</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Along the draws⁠—a trap about to spring.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He cupped his hands about his mouth and cried:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“Talbeau! Talbeau!” Despairing voices died</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the summits, and the lost wind pined.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It made Talbeau seem infinitely kind⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The one thing human in a ghostly land.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where was he? Just a touch of that warm hand</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Would thwart the dark! Mike sat against a wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And brooded.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i8">By and by a skittering fall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Of pebbles at his back aroused the man.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He scrambled to his feet and turned to scan</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The butte that sloped above him. Where the glow</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still washed the middle height, he saw Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Serenely perched upon a ledge of clay!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And Mike forgot the words he meant to say,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The fitted words, regretful of his deed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A forthright, stark sincerity of need</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Rough hewed the husky, incoherent prayer</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He shouted to that Lord of water there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Above the gloom. A little drop to drink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For old time’s sake!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Talbeau regarded Fink</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Awhile in silence; then his thin lips curled.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“You spilled the only drink in all the world!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Go on,” he said, “and think of what you’ve done!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Beyond the pointed muzzle of his gun</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He saw the big man wither to a squat</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And tremble, like a bison when the shot</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Just nips the vital circle. Then he saw</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A stooping figure hurry down the draw,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Grow dim, and vanish in the failing light.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>’Twas long before Talbeau could sleep that night.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some questioner, insistently perverse,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Assailed him and compelled him to rehearse</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The justifying story of the friend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betrayed and slain. But when he reached the end,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still unconvinced the questioner was there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To taunt him with that pleading of despair⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For old time’s sake! Sleep brought him little rest;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>For what the will denied, the heart confessed</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In mournful dreams. And when the first faint gray</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused him, and he started on his way,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He knew the stubborn questioner had won.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No brooding on the wrong that Mike had done</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Could still that cry: “Plase now, fer owld toime’s sake,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little dhrop!” It made his eyeballs ache</span>
						<br/>
						<span>With tears of pity that he couldn’t shed.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>No other dawn, save that when Bill lay dead</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And things began to stare about the hall,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had found the world so empty. After all,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What man could know the way another trod?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And who was he, Talbeau, to play at God?</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Let one who curbs the wind and brews the rain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Essay the subtler portioning of pain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To souls that err! Talbeau would make amends!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more they’d drink together and be friends.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>How often they had shared!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i15">He struck a trot,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Eyes fixed upon the trail. The sun rose hot;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Noon poured a blinding glare along the draws;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And still the trail led on, without a pause</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To show where Mike had rested. Thirst began</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To be a burden on the little man;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His progress dwindled to a dragging pace.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>But when he tipped the flask, that pleading face</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose before him, and a prayer denied</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Came mourning back to thrust his need aside⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little drop! How Mike must suffer now!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“I’m not so very thirsty, anyhow,”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He told himself. And almost any bend</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Might bring him on a sudden to his friend.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He’d wait and share the water.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">Every turn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Betrayed a hope. The west began to burn;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Flared red; went ashen; and the stars came out.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Dreams, colored by an unacknowledged doubt,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Perplexed the trail he followed in his sleep;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dreary hours before the tallest steep</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Saw dawn, Talbeau was waiting for the day.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>Till noon he read a writing in the clay</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That bade him haste; for now from wall to wall</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The footmarks wandered, like the crabbèd scrawl</span>
						<br/>
						<span>An old man writes. They told a gloomy tale.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And then the last dim inkling of a trail</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was lost upon a patch of hardened ground!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The red west saw him, like a nervous hound</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That noses vainly for the vanished track,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Still plunging into gullies, doubling back,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And pausing now and then to hurl a yell</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Among the ululating steeps. Night fell.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The starlit buttes still heard him panting by,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And summits weird with midnight caught his cry</span>
						<br/>
						<span>To answer, mocking.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i11">Morning brought despair;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Nor did he get much comfort of his prayer:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>“God, let me find him! Show me where to go!”</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Some greater, unregenerate Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was God that morning; for the lesser heard</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His own bleak answer echoed word for word:</span>
						<br/>
						<span>
							<em>Go on, and think of all the wrong you’ve done!</em>
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>His futile wish to hasten sped the sun.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That day, as he recalled it in the dark,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Was like the spinning of a burning arc.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He nodded, and the night was but a swoon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And morning neighbored strangely with the noon;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And evening was the noon’s penumbral haze.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>No further ran the reckoning of days.</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas evening when at last he stooped to stare</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a puzzling trail. A wounded bear,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>It seemed, had dragged its rump across the sands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>That floored the gullies now. But sprawling hands</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Had marked the margin! Why was that? No doubt</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Mike too had tarried here to puzzle out</span>
						<br/>
						<span>What sort of beast had passed. And yet⁠—how queer⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>’Twas plain no human feet had trodden here!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A trail of hands! That throbbing in his brain</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Confused his feeble efforts to explain;</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And hazily he wondered if he slept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And dreamed again. Tenaciously he kept</span>
						<br/>
						<span>His eyes upon the trail and labored on,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Lest, swooping like a hawk, another dawn</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Should snatch that hope away.</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span class="i16">A sentry crow,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Upon a sunlit summit, saw Talbeau</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And croaked alarm. The noise of many wings,</span>
						<br/>
						<span>In startled flight, and raucous chatterings</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Arose. What feast was interrupted there</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A little way ahead? ’Twould be the bear!</span>
						<br/>
						<span>He plodded on. The intervening space</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Sagged under him; and, halting at the place</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Where late the flock had been, he strove to break</span>
						<br/>
						<span>A grip of horror. Surely now he’d wake</span>
						<br/>
						<span>And see the morning quicken in the skies!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>The thing remained!⁠—It hadn’t any eyes⁠—</span>
						<br/>
						<span>The pilfered sockets bore a pleading stare!</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						<span>A long, hoarse wail of anguish and despair</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Aroused the echoes. Answering, arose</span>
						<br/>
						<span>Once more the jeering chorus of the crows.</span>
