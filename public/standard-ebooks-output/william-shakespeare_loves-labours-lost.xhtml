Yet was Samson so tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit. Cupid’s butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules’ club; and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard’s rapier. The first and second cause will not serve my turn; the passado he respects not, the duello he regards not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier! be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea, he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme, for I am sure I shall turn sonnet.

More fairer than fair, beautiful than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say, <i xml:lang="la">Veni, vidi, vici</i>; which to annothanize in the vulgar⁠—O base and obscure vulgar!⁠—videlicet, He came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two; overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king’s. The captive is enriched: on whose side? the beggar’s. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose side? the king’s: no, on both in one, or one in both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison: thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness. Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes; for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus, expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot, my eyes on thy picture, and my heart on thy every part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,</p>

									<span>To fast, to study, and to see no woman;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Flat treason ’gainst the kingly state of youth.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And abstinence engenders maladies.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And where that you have vow’d to study, lords,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Have found the ground of study’s excellence</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Without the beauty of a woman’s face?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They are the ground, the books, the academes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Why, universal plodding poisons up</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The nimble spirits in the arteries,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As motion and long-during action tires</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The sinewy vigour of the traveller.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now, for not looking on a woman’s face,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>You have in that forsworn the use of eyes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And study too, the causer of your vow;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For where is any author in the world</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Teaches such beauty as a woman’s eye?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Learning is but an adjunct to ourself</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And where we are our learning likewise is:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then when ourselves we see in ladies’ eyes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Do we not likewise see our learning there?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, we have made a vow to study, lords,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And in that vow we have forsworn our books.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>In leaden contemplation have found out</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Of beauty’s tutors have enrich’d you with?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And therefore, finding barren practisers,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But love, first learned in a lady’s eyes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Lives not alone immured in the brain;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>But, with the motion of all elements,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Courses as swift as thought in every power,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And gives to every power a double power,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Above their functions and their offices.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It adds a precious seeing to the eye;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A lover’s eyes will gaze an eagle blind;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>A lover’s ear will hear the lowest sound,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>When the suspicious head of theft is stopp’d:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Love’s feeling is more soft and sensible</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than are the tender horns of cockl’d snails;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Love’s tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For valour, is not Love a Hercules,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical</span>
									<br/>
									<span>As bright Apollo’s lute, strung with his hair;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Never durst poet touch a pen to write</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Until his ink were temper’d with Love’s sighs;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O, then his lines would ravish savage ears</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And plant in tyrants mild humility.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>From women’s eyes this doctrine I derive:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>They are the books, the arts, the academes,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>That show, contain and nourish all the world:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Else none at all in ought proves excellent.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Then fools you were these women to forswear,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>For wisdom’s sake, a word that all men love,</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>It is religion to be thus forsworn,</span>
