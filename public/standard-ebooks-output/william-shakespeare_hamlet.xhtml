									<span>To be, or not to be: that is the question:</span>

									<span>The undiscover’d country from whose bourn</span>

									<span>No traveller returns, puzzles the will</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And makes us rather bear those ills we have</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Than fly to others that we know not of?</span>

									<span>Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;</span>

									<span>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought,</span>

									<span>The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.</span>

									<span>See, what a grace was seated on this brow;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Hyperion’s curls; the front of Jove himself;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>Here is your husband; like a mildew’d ear,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,</span>
									<br/>

									<br/>
									<span>You cannot call it love; for at your age</span>
									<br/>
									<span>The hey-day in the blood is tame, it’s humble,</span>

									<span>And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Nor sense to ecstasy was ne’er so thrall’d</span>

									<br/>
									<span>Or but a sickly part of one true sense</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Could not so mope.</span>
									<br/>
									<span>O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If thou canst mutine in a matron’s bones,</span>

They have dealt with me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death.

					<p>In an effort to create a complete form of Hamlet, William George Clark and William Aldis Wright combined parts of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Hamlet</i> from both the Second Quarto and First Folio. This portion of dialogue originates from the Second Quarto but the verse line is missing a word. The printing of the Second Quarto skips a word making the line read “And either the devil, or throw him out.” Shakespeare’s original intent has been lost, and modern scholars have a variety of theories on what it might have been. Scholars have proposed “master” as a possible emendation. Other guesses made by scholars include “curb,” “lodge,” “reign,” and “seize.” <cite>—⁠Emma Sweeney</cite> <a href="act-3.xhtml#noteref-1" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Here we encounter another complication due to combining two versions of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Hamlet</i>. In the First Folio, the text is missing almost four lines of verse. These lines have been restored from the Second Quarto but the print was not perfect: a portion of a verse line was not completed. Scholars have proposed “So haply slander⁠—” as a possible emendation. Another guess made by scholars is “So dreaded slander⁠—.” <cite>—⁠Emma Sweeney</cite> <a href="act-4.xhtml#noteref-2" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
