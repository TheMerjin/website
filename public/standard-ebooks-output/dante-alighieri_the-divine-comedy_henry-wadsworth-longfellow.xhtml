					<p>The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="it">Vita Nuova</i> of Dante closes with these words:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“After this sonnet there appeared to me a wonderful vision, in which I beheld things that made me propose to say no more of this blessed one, until I shall be able to treat of her more worthily. And to attain thereunto, truly I strive with all my power, as she knoweth. So that if it shall be the pleasure of Him, through whom all things live, that my life continue somewhat longer, I hope to say of her what never yet was said of any woman. And then may it please Him, who is the Sire of courtesy, that my soul may depart to look upon the glory of its Lady, that is to say, of the blessed Beatrice, who in glory gazes into the face of Him, <i xml:lang="la">qui est per omnia sæcula benedictus</i>.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In these lines we have the earliest glimpse of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Divine Comedy</i>, as it rose in the author’s mind.</p>
					<p>Whoever has read the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="it">Vita Nuova</i> will remember the stress which Dante lays upon the mystic numbers Nine and Three; his first meeting with Beatrice at the beginning of her ninth year, and the end of his; his nine days’ illness, and the thought of her death which came to him on the ninth day; her death on the ninth day of the ninth month, “computing by the Syrian method,” and in that year of our Lord “when the perfect number ten was nine times completed in that century” which was the thirteenth. Moreover, he says the number nine was friendly to her, because the nine heavens were in conjunction at her birth; and that she was herself the number nine, “that is, a miracle whose root is the wonderful Trinity.”</p>
					<p>Following out this idea, we find the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Divine Comedy</i> written in terza rima, or threefold rhyme, divided into three parts, and each part again subdivided in its structure into three. The whole number of cantos is one hundred, the perfect number ten multiplied into itself; but if we count the first canto of the Inferno as a Prelude, which it really is, each part will consist of thirty-three cantos, making ninety-nine in all; and so the favorite mystic numbers reappear.</p>
					<p>The three divisions of the Inferno are minutely described and explained by Dante in Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>. They are separated from each other by great spaces in the infernal abyss. The sins punished in them are⁠—<span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> Incontinence. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> Malice. <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> Bestiality.</p>
					<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <b>Incontinence</b>: 1. The Wanton. 2. The Gluttonous. 3. The Avaricious and Prodigal. 4. The Irascible and the Sullen.</p>
					<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> <b>Malice</b>: 1. The Violent against their neighbor, in person or property. 2. The Violent against themselves, in person or property. 3. The Violent against God, or against Nature, the daughter of God, or against Art, the daughter of Nature.</p>
					<p><span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> <b>Bestiality</b>: first subdivision: 1. Seducers. 2. Flatterers. 3. Simoniacs. 4. Soothsayers. 5. Barrators. 6. Hypocrites. 7. Thieves. 8. Evil counsellors. 9. Schismatics. 10. Falsifiers.</p>
					<p>Second subdivision: 1. Traitors to their kindred. 2. Traitors to their country. 3. Traitors to their friends. 4. Traitors to their lords and benefactors.</p>
					<p>The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Divine Comedy</i> is not strictly an allegorical poem in the sense in which the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Faerie Queene</i> is; and yet it is full of allegorical symbols and figurative meanings. In a letter to Can Grande della Scala, Dante writes:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“It is to be remarked, that the sense of this work is not simple, but on the contrary one may say manifold. For one sense is that which is derived from the letter, and another is that which is derived from the things signified by the letter. The first is called literal, the second allegorical or moral⁠ ⁠… The subject, then, of the whole work, taken literally, is the condition of souls after death, simply considered. For on this and around this the whole action of the work turns. But if the work be taken allegorically, the subject is man, how by actions of merit or demerit, through freedom of the will, he justly deserves reward or punishment.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It may not be amiss here to refer to what are sometimes called the sources of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Divine Comedy</i>. Foremost among them must be placed the Eleventh Book of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Odyssey</i>, and the Sixth of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Aeneid</i>; and to the latter Dante seems to point significantly in choosing Virgil for his Guide, his Master, his Author, from whom he took “the beautiful style that did him honor.”</p>
					<p>Next to these may be mentioned Cicero’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Vision of Scipio</i>, of which Chaucer says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem" xml:lang="enm">
						<p>
							<span>“Chapiters seven it had, of Heven, and Hell,</span>
							<br/>
							<span>And Earthe, and soules that therein do dwell.”</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Then follow the popular legends which were current in Dante’s age; an age when the end of all things was thought to be near at hand, and the wonders of the invisible world had laid fast hold on the imaginations of men. Prominent among these is the “Vision of Frate Alberico,” who calls himself “the humblest servant of the servants of the Lord”; and who</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
						<p>
							<span>“Saw in dreame at point-devyse</span>
							<br/>
							<span>Heaven, Earthe, Hell, and Paradyse.”</span>
						</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>This vision was written in Latin in the latter half of the twelfth century, and contains a description of Hell, Purgatory, and Paradise, with its Seven Heavens. It is for the most part a tedious tale, and bears evident marks of having been written by a friar of some monastery, when the afternoon sun was shining into his sleepy eyes. He seems, however, to have looked upon his own work with a not unfavorable opinion; for he concludes the Epistle Introductory with the words of <abbr>St.</abbr> John:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book; and if any man shall take away from these things, God shall take away his part from the good things written in this book.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It is not impossible that Dante may have taken a few hints also from the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i> of his teacher, Ser Brunetto Latini, See <a href="#note-212">note 212</a>.</p>

					<p>In this passage Dante but expresses the universal veneration felt for Virgil during the Middle Ages, and especially in Italy. Petrarch’s copy of Virgil is still preserved in the Ambrosian Library at Milan; and at the beginning of it he has recorded in a Latin note the time of his first meeting with Laura, and the date of her death, which, he says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“I write in this book, rather than elsewhere, because it comes often under my eye.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In the popular imagination Virgil became a mythical personage and a mighty magician. See the story of <em>Virgilius</em> in Thom’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Early Prose Romances</i>, 11. Dante selects him for his guide, as symbolizing human science or Philosophy. “I say and affirm,” he remarks, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 16, “that the lady with whom I became enamored after my first love was the most beautiful and modest daughter of the Emperor of the Universe, to whom Pythagoras gave the name of Philosophy.” <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-20" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“In describing a simple twilight⁠—not a Hades twilight, but an ordinarily fair evening⁠—(<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Inferno</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 1), he says, the ‘brown’ air took the animals away from their fatigues;⁠—the waves under Charon’s boat are ‘brown’ (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Inferno</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 117); and Lethe, which is perfectly clear and yet dark, as with oblivion, is ‘bruna-bruna,’ ‘brown’ <em>exceeding</em> brown.’ Now, clearly in all these cases no <em>warmth</em> is meant to be mingled in the color. Dante had never seen one of our bog-streams, with its porter-colored foam; and there can be no doubt that, in calling Lethe brown, he means that it was dark slate-gray, inclining to black; as, for instance, our clear Cumberland lakes, which, looked straight down upon where they are deep, seem to be lakes of ink. I am sure this is the color he means; because no clear stream or lake on the Continent ever looks brown, but blue or green; and Dante, by merely taking away the pleasant color, would get at once to this idea of grave clear gray. So, when he was talking of twilight, his eye for color was far too good to let him call it <em>brown</em> in our sense. Twilight is not brown, but purple, golden, or dark gray; and this last was what Dante meant. Farther, I find that this negation of color is always the means by which Dante subdues his tones. Thus the fatal inscription on the Hades gate is written in ‘obscure color,’ and the air which torments the passionate spirits is ‘aer nero,’ <em>black</em> air (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Inferno</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 51), called presently afterwards (line 81) malignant air, just as the gray cliffs are called malignant cliffs.”</p>

He describes himself as a flower, first bent and closed by the night frosts, and then <em>blanched</em> or <em>whitened</em> by the sun (the symbol of reason), which opens its leaves; and what produces the effect of the sun on him is a speech of Virgil’s, persuading him to follow his guidance.”</p>

					<p>Ruskin, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Modern Painters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 215, speaking of the Inferno, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Milton’s effort, in all that he tells us of his Inferno, is to make it indefinite; Dante’s, to make it <em>definite</em>. Both, indeed, describe it as entered through gates; but, within the gate, all is wild and fenceless with Milton, having indeed its four rivers⁠—the last vestige of the medieval tradition⁠—but rivers which flow through a waste of mountain and moorland, and by ‘many a frozen, many a fiery Alp.’ But Dante’s Inferno is accurately separated into circles drawn with well-pointed compasses; mapped and properly surveyed in every direction, trenched in a thoroughly good style of engineering from depth to depth, and divided, in the ‘<em>accurate</em> middle’ (<i xml:lang="it">dritto mezzo</i>) of its deepest abyss, into a concentric series of ten moats and embankments, like those about a castle, with bridges from each embankment to the next; precisely in the manner of those bridges over Hiddekel and Euphrates, which <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Macaulay thinks so innocently designed, apparently not aware that he is also laughing at Dante. These larger fosses are of rock, and the bridges also; but as he goes further into detail, Dante tells us of various minor fosses and embankments, in which he anxiously points out to us not only the formality, but the neatness and perfectness, of the stonework. For instance, in describing the river Phlegethon, he tells us that it was ‘paved with stone at the bottom, and at the sides, and <em>over the edges of the sides</em>,’ just as the water is at the baths of Bulicame; and for fear we should think this embankment at all larger than it really was, Dante adds, carefully, that it was made just like the embankments of Ghent or Bruges against the sea, or those in Lombardy which bank the Brenta, only ‘not so high, nor so wide,’ as any of these. And besides the trenches, we have two well-built castles; one like Ecbatana, with seven circuits of wall (and surrounded by a fair stream), wherein the great poets and sages of antiquity live; and another, a great fortified city with walls of iron, red-hot, and a deep fosse round it, and full of ‘grave citizens,’⁠—the city of Dis.</p>
						<p>“Now, whether this be in what we moderns call ‘good taste,’ or not, I do not mean just now to inquire⁠—Dante having nothing to do with taste, but with the facts of what he had seen; only, so far as the imaginative faculty of the two poets is concerned, note that Milton’s vagueness is not the sign of imagination, but of its absence, so far as it is significative in the matter. For it does not follow, because Milton did not map out his Inferno as Dante did, that he <em>could</em> not have done so if he had chosen; only it was the easier and less imaginative process to leave it vague than to define it. Imagination is always the seeing and asserting faculty; that which obscures or conceals may be judgment, or feeling, but not invention. The invention, whether good or bad, is in the accurate engineering, not in the fog and uncertainty.”</p>

					<p>Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 194, speaks thus upon the subject:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The abdication of Celestine <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> was an event unprecedented in the annals of the Church, and jarred harshly against some of the first principles of the Papal authority. It was a confession of common humanity, of weakness below the ordinary standard of men in him whom the Conclave, with more than usual certitude, as guided by the special interposition of the Holy Ghost, had raised to the spiritual throne of the world. The Conclave had been, as it seemed, either under an illusion as to this declared manifestation of the Holy Spirit, or had been permitted to deceive itself. Nor was there less incongruity in a Pope, whose office invested him in something at least approaching to infallibility, acknowledging before the world his utter incapacity, his undeniable fallibility. That idea, formed out of many conflicting conceptions, yet forcibly harmonized by long, traditionary reverence, of unerring wisdom, oracular truth, authority which it was sinful to question or limit, was strangely disturbed and confused, not as before by too overweening ambition, or even awful yet still unacknowledged crime, but by avowed weakness, bordering on imbecility. His profound piety hardly reconciled the confusion. A saint after all made but a bad Pope.</p>
						<p>“It was viewed, in his own time, in a different light by different minds. The monkish writers held it up as the most noble example of monastic, of Christian perfection. Admirable as was his election, his abdication was even more to be admired. It was an example of humility stupendous to all, imitable by few. The divine approval was said to be shown by a miracle which followed directly on his resignation; but the scorn of man has been expressed by the undying verse of Dante, who condemned him who was guilty of the baseness of the ‘great refusal’ to that circle of hell where are those disdained alike by mercy and justice, on whom the poet will not condescend to look. This sentence, so accordant with the stirring and passionate soul of the great Florentine, has been feebly counteracted, if counteracted, by the praise of Petrarch in his declamation on the beauty of a solitary life, for which the lyrist professed a somewhat hollow and poetic admiration. Assuredly there was no magnanimity contemptuous of the Papal greatness in the abdication of Celestine; it was the weariness, the conscious inefficiency, the regret of a man suddenly wrenched away from all his habits, pursuits, and avocations, and unnaturally compelled or tempted to assume an uncongenial dignity. It was the cry of passionate feebleness to be released from an insupportable burden. Compassion is the highest emotion of sympathy which it would have desired or could deserve.”</p>

Hither the whole tribe in swarms come pouring to the banks, matrons and men, the souls of magnanimous heroes who had gone through life, boys and unmarried maids, and young men who had been stretched on the funeral pile before the eyes of their parents; as numerous as withered leaves fall in the woods with the first cold of autumn, or as numerous as birds flock to the land from deep ocean, when the chilling year drives them beyond sea, and sends them to sunny climes. They stood praying to cross the flood the first, and were stretching forth their hands with fond desire to gain the further bank: but the sullen boatman admits sometimes these, sometimes those; while others to a great distance removed, he debars from the banks.”</p>

					<p>Many critics, and foremost among them Padre Pompeo Venturi, blame Dante for mingling together things Pagan and Christian. But they should remember how through all the Middle Ages human thought was wrestling with the old traditions; how many Pagan observances passed into Christianity in those early days; what reverence Dante had for Virgil and the classics; and how many Christian nations still preserve some traces of Paganism in the names of the stars, the months, and the days. Padre Pompeo should not have forgotten that he, though a Christian, bore a Pagan name, which perhaps is as evident a <i xml:lang="it">brutto miscuglio</i> in a learned Jesuit, as any which he has pointed out in Dante.</p>
					<p>Upon him and other commentators of the Divine Poem, a very amusing chapter might be written. While the great Comedy is going on upon the scene above, with all its pomp and music, these critics in the pit keep up such a perpetual wrangling among themselves, as seriously to disturb the performance. Biagioli is the most violent of all, particularly against Venturi, whom he calls an “infamous dirty dog,” <i xml:lang="it">sozzo can vituperato</i>, an epithet hardly permissible in the most heated literary controversy. Whereupon in return Zani de’ Ferranti calls Biagioli “an inurbane grammarian,” and a “most ungrateful ingrate,”⁠—<i xml:lang="it">quel grammatico inurbano⁠ ⁠… ingrato ingratissimo</i>.</p>

					<p>Of this word “enamel” <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Ruskin, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Modern Painters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 227, remarks:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The first instance I know of its right use, though very probably it had been so employed before, is in Dante. The righteous spirits of the pre-Christian ages are seen by him, though in the Inferno, yet in a place open, luminous and high, walking upon the ‘green enamel.’</p>
						<p>“I am very sure that Dante did not use this phrase as we use it. He knew well what enamel was; and his readers, in order to understand him thoroughly, must remember what it is⁠—a vitreous paste, dissolved in water, mixed with metallic oxides, to give it the opacity and the color required, spread in a moist state on metal, and afterwards hardened by fire, so as never to change. And Dante means, in using this metaphor of the grass of the Inferno, to mark that it is laid as a tempering and cooling substance over the dark, metallic, gloomy ground; but yet so hardened by the fire, that it is not any more fresh or living grass, but a smooth, silent, lifeless bed of eternal green. And we know how <em>hard</em> Dante’s idea of it was; because afterwards, in what is perhaps the most awful passage of the whole Inferno, when the three furies rise at the top of the burning tower, and, catching sight of Dante, and not being able to get at him, shriek wildly for the Gorgon to come up, too, that they may turn him into stone, the word <em>stone</em> is not hard enough for them. Stone might crumble away after it was made, or something with life might grow upon it; no, it shall not be stone; they will make enamel of him; nothing can grow out of that; it is dead forever.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“About this time (1193) died the great Sultan Saladin, the greatest terror of the Christians, who, mindful of man’s fragility and the vanity of worldly honors, commanded at the time of his death no solemnity to be used at his burial, but only his shirt, in manner of an ensign, made fast unto the point of a lance, to be carried before his dead body as an ensign, a plain priest going before, and crying aloud unto the peopie in this sort, ‘Saladin, Conqueror of the East, of all the greatness and riches he had in his life, carrieth not with him anything more than his shirt.’ A sight worthy so great a king, as wanted nothing to his eternal commendation more than the true knowledge of his salvation in Christ Jesus. He reigned about sixteen years with great honor.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“On another occasion the great Saladin, in the career of victory, proclaimed a truce between the Christian armies and his own. During this interval he visited the camp and the cities belonging to his enemies, with the design, should he approve of the customs and manners of the people, of embracing the Christian faith. He observed their tables spread with the finest damask coverings ready prepared for the feast, and he praised their magnificence. On entering the tents of the king of France during a festival, he was much pleased with the order and ceremony with which everything was conducted, and the courteous manner in which he feasted his nobles; but when he approached the residence of the poorer class, and perceived them devouring their miserable pittance upon the ground, he blamed the want of gratitude which permitted so many faithful followers of their chief to fare so much worse than the rest of their Christian brethren.</p>
						<p>“Afterwards, several of the Christian leaders returned with the Sultan to observe the manners of the Saracens. They appeared much shocked on seeing all ranks of people take their meals sitting upon the ground. The Sultan led them into a grand pavilion where he feasted his court, surrounded with the most beautiful tapestries, and rich foot-cloths, on which were wrought large embroidered figures of the cross. The Christian chiefs trampled them under their feet with the utmost indifference, and even rubbed their boots, and spat upon them.</p>
						<p>“On perceiving this, the Sultan turned towards them in the greatest anger, exclaiming: ‘And do you who pretend to preach the cross treat it thus ignominiously? Gentlemen, I am shocked at your conduct. Am I to suppose from this that the worship of your Deity consists only in words, not in actions? Neither your manners nor your conduct please me.’ And on this he dismissed them, breaking off the truce and commencing hostilities more warmly than before.”</p>

Francesca and her Lover, what qualities in that! A thing woven as out of rainbows, on a ground of eternal black. A small flute-voice of infinite wail speaks there, into our very heart of hearts.

Infinite pity, yet also infinite rigor of law: it is so Nature is made; it is so Dante discerned that she was made.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Later commentators assert that Dante’s friend Guido was not the father of Francesca, but her nephew.</p>
					<p>Boccaccio’s account, translated from his Commentary by Leigh Hunt, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Stories from the Italian Poets</i>, Appendix <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, is as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“You must know that this lady. Madonna Francesca, was daughter of Messer Guido the Elder, lord of Ravenna and of Cervia, and that a long and grievous war having been waged between him and the lords Malatesta of Rimini, a treaty of peace by certain mediators was at length concluded between them; the which, to the end that it might be the more firmly established, it pleased both parties to desire to fortify by relationship; and the matter of this relationship was so discoursed, that the said Messer Guido agreed to give his young and fair daughter in marriage to Gianciotto, the son of Messer Malatesta. Now, this being made known to certain of the friends of Messer Guido, one of them said to him: ‘Take care what you do; for if you contrive not matters discreetly, such relationship will beget scandal. You know what manner of person your daughter is, and of how lofty a spirit; and if she see Gianciotto before the bond is tied, neither you nor any one else will have power to persuade her to marry him; therefore, if it so please you, it seems to me that it would be good to conduct the matter thus: namely, that Gianciotto should not come hither himself to marry her, but that a brother of his should come and espouse her in his name.’</p>
						<p>“Gianciotto was a man of great spirit, and hoped, after his father’s death, to become lord of Rimini; in the contemplation of which event, albeit he was rude in appearance and a cripple, Messer Guido desired him for a son-in-law above any one of his brothers. Discerning, therefore, the reasonableness of what his friend counselled, he secretly disposed matters according to his device; and a day being appointed. Polo, a brother of Gianciotto, came to Ravenna with full authority to espouse Madonna Francesca. Polo was a handsome man, very pleasant, and of a courteous breeding; and passing with other gentlemen over the courtyard of the palace of Messer Guido, a damsel who knew him pointed him out to Madonna Francesca through an opening in the casement, saying, ‘That is he that is to be your husband;’ and so indeed the poor lady believed, and incontinently placed in him her whole affection; and the ceremony of the marriage having been thus brought about, and the lady conveyed to Rimini, she became not aware of the deceit till the morning ensuing the marriage, when she beheld Gianciotto rise from her side; the which discovery moved her to such disdain, that she became not a whit the less rooted in her love for Polo. Nevertheless, that it grew to be unlawful I never heard, except in what is written by this author (Dante), and possibly it might so have become; albeit I take what he says to have been an invention framed on the possibility, rather than anything which he knew of his own knowledge. Be this as it may. Polo and Madonna Francesca living in the same house, and Gianciotto being gone into a certain neighboring district as governor, they fell into great companionship with one another, suspecting nothing; but a servant of Gianciotto’s, noting it, went to his master and told him how matters looked; with the which Gianciotto being fiercely moved, secretly returned to Rimini; and seeing Polo enter the room of Madonna Francesca the while he himself was arriving, went straight to the door, and finding it locked inside, called to his lady to come out; for, Madonna Francesca and Polo having descried him. Polo thought to escape suddenly through an opening in the wall, by means of which there was a descent into another room; and therefore, thinking to conceal his fault either wholly or in part, he threw himself into the opening, telling the lady to go and open the door. But his hope did not turn out as he expected; for the hem of a mantle which he had on caught upon a nail, and the lady opening the door meantime, in the belief that all would be well by reason of Polo’s not being there, Gianciotto caught sight of Polo as he was detained by the hem of the mantle, and straightway ran with his dagger in his hand to kill him; whereupon the lady, to prevent it, ran between them; but Gianciotto having lifted the dagger, and put the whole force of his arm into the blow, there came to pass what he had not desired⁠—namely, that he struck the dagger into the bosom of the lady before it could reach Polo; by which accident, being as one who had loved the lady better than himself, he withdrew the dagger and again struck at Polo, and slew him; and so leaving them both dead, he hastily went his way and betook him to his wonted affairs; and the next morning the two lovers, with many tears, were buried together in the same grave.”</p>

Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 61. The Corso Donati here mentioned is the Leader of the Neri. His violent death is predicted, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Purgatorio</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXIV</span> 82:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“There dwelt somtime in Florence one that was generally called by the name of Ciacco, a man being the greatest Gourmand and grossest Feeder as ever was seen in any Countrey, all his means and procurements meerly unable to maintain expenses for filling his belly. But otherwise he was of sufficient and commendable carriage, fairly demeaned, and well discoursing on any Argument: yet not as a curious and spruce Courtier, but rather a frequenter of rich mens Tables, where choice of good cheer is seldom wanting, and such should have his Company, albeit not invited, he had the Courage to bid himself welcome.</p>
						<p>“At the same time, and in our City of Florence also, there was another man named Biondello, very low of stature, yet comely formed, quick witted, more neat and brisk than a Butterflie, always wearing a wrought silk Cap on his head, and not a hair standing out of order, but the tuft flourishing above the forehead, and he such another trencher flie for the Table, as our forenamed Ciacco was. It so fell out on a morning in the Lent time, that he went into the Fish-market, where he bought two goodly Lampreys for Messer Viero de Cerchi, and was espyed by Ciacco, who, coming to Biondello, said, ‘What is the meaning of this cost, and for whom is it?’ Whereto Biondello thus answered, ‘Yesternight three other Lampreys, far fairer than these, and a whole Sturgeon, were sent unto Messer Corso Donati, and being not sufficient to feed divers Gentlemen, whom he hath invited this day to dine with him, he caused me to buy these two beside: Dost not thou intend to make one of them?’ ‘Yes, I warrant thee,’ replyed Ciacco, ‘thou knowest I can invite myself thither, without any other bidding.’</p>
						<p>“So parting, about the hour of dinner time Ciacco went to the house of Messer Corso, whom he found sitting and talking with certain of his Neighbours, but dinner was not as yet ready, neither were they come thither to dinner. Messer Corso demanded of Ciacco, what news with him, and whether he went? ‘Why Sir,’ said Ciacco, ‘I come to dine with you, and your good Company.’ Whereto Messer Corso answered. That he was welcome: and his other friends being gone, dinner was served in, none else thereat present but Messer Corso and Ciacco: all the diet being a poor dish of Peas, a little piece of Tunny, and a few small fishes fryed, without any other dishes to follow after. Ciacco seeing no better fare, but being disappointed of his expectation, as longing to feed on the Lampreys and Sturgeon, and so to have made a full dinner indeed, was of a quick apprehension, and apparently perceived that Biondello had meerly gull’d him in a knavery, which did not a little vex him, and made him vow to be revenged on Biondello, as he could compass occasion afterward.</p>
						<p>“Before many days were past, it was his fortune to meet with Biondello, who having told his jest to divers of his friends, and much good merryment made thereat: he saluted Ciacco in a kind manner, saying, ‘How didst thou like the fat Lampreys and Sturgeon which thou fed’st on at the house of Messer Corso?’ ‘Well, Sir,’ answered Ciacco, ‘perhaps before Eight days pass over my head, thou shalt meet with as pleasing a dinner as I did.’ So, parting away from Biondello, he met with a Porter, such as are usually sent on Errands; and hyring him to do a message for him, gave him a glass Bottle, and bringing him near to the Hall-house of Cavicciuli, showed him there a Knight, called Signior Philippo Argenti, a man of huge stature, very cholerick, and sooner moved to Anger than any other man. ‘To him thou must go with this Bottle in thy hand, and say thus to him. Sir, Biondello sent me to you, and courteously entreateth you, that you would erubinate this glass Bottle with your best Claret Wine; because he would make merry with a few friends of his. But beware he lay no hand on thee, because he may be easily induced to misuse thee, and so my business be disappointed.’ ‘Well, Sir,’ said the Porter, ‘shall I say anything else unto him?’ ‘No,’ quoth Ciacco, ‘only go and deliver this message, and when thou art returned, I’ll pay thee for thy pains.’ The Porter being gone to the house, delivered his message to the Knight, who, being a man of no great civil breeding, but very furious, presently conceived that Biondello, whom he knew well enough, sent this message in meer mockage of him, and, starting up with fierce looks, said, ‘What erubination of Claret should I send him? and what have I to do with him or his drunken friends? Let him and thee go hang your selves together.’ So he stepped to catch hold on the Porter, but he being nimble and escaping from him, returned to Ciacco and told him the answer of Philippe. Ciacco, not a little contented, payed the Porter, tarried in no place till he met Biondello, to whom he said, When wast thou at the Hall of Cavicciuli?’ ‘Not a long while,’ answered Biondello; ‘but why dost thou demand such a question?’ ‘Because,’ quoth Ciacco, ‘Signior Philippe hath sought about for thee, yet know not I what he would have with thee.’ ‘Is it so,’ replied Biondello, ‘then I will walk thither presently, to understand his pleasure,’</p>
						<p>“When Biondello was thus parted from him, Ciacco followed not far off behind him, to behold the issue of this angry business; and Signior Philippo, because he could not catch the Porter, continued much distempered, fretting and fuming, because he could not comprehend the meaning of the Porter’s message, but only surmised that Biondello, by the procurement of somebody else, had done this in scorn of him. While he remained thus deeply discontented, he espyed Biondello coming towards him, and meeting him by the way, he stepped close to him and gave him a cruel blow on the Face, causing his Nose to fall out a bleeding. ‘Alas, Sir,’ said Biondello, ‘wherefore do you strike me?’ Signior Philippo, catching him by the hair of the head, trampled his Night Cap in the dirt, and his Cloak also, when, laying many violent blows on him, he said, ‘Villainous Traitor as thou art, I’ll teach thee what it is to erubinate with Claret, either thy self or any of thy cupping Companions. Am I a Child to be jested withal?’</p>
						<p>“Nor was he more furious in words than in stroaks also, beating him about the Face, hardly leaving any hair on his head, and dragging him along in the mire, spoiling all his Garments, and he not able, from the first blow given, to speak a word in defence of himself. In the end Signior Philippo having extreamly beaten him, and many poople gathering about them, to succour a man so much misused, the matter was at large related, and manner of the message sending. For which they all did greatly reprehend Biondello, considering he knew what kind of man Philippo was, not any way to be jested withal. Biondello in tears maintained that he never sent any such message for Wine, or intended it in the least degree; so, when the tempest was more mildly calmed, and Biondello, thus cruelly beaten and durtied, had gotten home to his own house, he could then remember that (questionless) this was occasioned by Ciacco.</p>
						<p>“After some few days were passed over, and the hurts in his face indifferently cured, Biondello beginning to walk abroad again, chanced to meet with Ciacco, who, laughing heartily at him, said, ‘Tell me, Biondello, how dost thou like the erubinating Claret of Signior Philippo?’ ‘As well,’ quoth Biondello, ‘as thou didst the Sturgeon and Lampreys at Messer Corso Donaties.’ ‘Why then,’ said Ciacco, ‘let these tokens continue familiar between thee and me, when thou wouldest bestow such another dinner on me, then will I erubinate thy Nose with a Bottle of the same Claret.’ But Biondello perceived to his cost that he had met with the worser bargain, and Ciacco got cheer without any blows; and therefore desired a peaceful! attonement, each of them always after abstaining from flouting one another.”</p>

And so fast did the various branches of this family spread, that in a short time they numbered a hundred men at arms, and being superior to every other, both in wealth and power, would have still increased, but that a cruel division arose between them, from some rivalship in the affections of a lovely and enchanting girl, and from angry words they proceeded to more angry blows.

						<p>“Having at last come to action, the Neri were defeated, and wishing to adjust the affair as well as they yet could, they sent their relation, who had offended the opposite party, to entreat forgiveness on the part of the Neri, expecting that such submissive conduct would meet with the compassion it deserved. On arriving in the presence of the Bianchi, who conceived themselves the offended party, the young man, on bended knees, appealed to their feelings for forgiveness, observing, that he had placed himself in their power, that so they might inflict what punishment they judged proper; when several of the younger members of the offended party, seizing on him, dragged him into an adjoining stable, and ordered that his right hand should be severed from his body. In the utmost terror the youth, with tears in his eyes, besought them to have mercy, and to take a greater and nobler revenge, by pardoning one whom they had it in their power thus deeply to injure. But heedless of his prayers, they bound his hand by force upon the manger, and struck it off; a deed which excited the utmost tumult throughout Pistoia, and such indignation and reproaches from the injured party of the Neri, as to implicate the whole city in a division of interests between them and the Bianchi, which led to many desperate encounters.</p>
						<p>“The citizens, fearful lest the faction might cause insurrections throughout the whole territory, in conjunction with the Guelfs, applied to the Florentines in order to reconcile them; on which the Florentines took possession of the place, and sent the partisans on both sides to the confines of Florence, whence it happened that the Neri sought refuge in the house of the Frescobaldi, and the Bianchi in that of the Cerchi nel Garbo, owing to the relationship which existed between them. The seeds of the same dissension being thus sown in Florence, the whole city became divided, the Cerchi espousing the interests of the Bianchi, and the Donati those of the Neri.</p>
						<p>“So rapidly did this pestiferous spirit gain ground in Florence, as frequently to excite the greatest tumult; and from a peaceable and flourishing state, it speedily became a scene of rapine and devastation. In this stage Pope Boniface <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> was made acquainted with the state of this ravaged and unhappy city, and sent the Cardinal Acqua Sparta on a mission to reform and pacify the enraged parties. But with his utmost efforts he was unable to make any impression, and accordingly, after declaring the place excommunicated, departed. Florence being thus exposed to the greatest perils, and in a continued state of insurrection, Messer Corso Donati, with the Spini, the Pazzi, the Tosinghi, the Cavicciuli, and the populace attached to the Neri faction, applied, with the consent of their leaders, to Pope Boniface. They entreated that he would employ his interest with the court of France to send a force to allay these feuds, and to quell the party of the Bianchi. As soon as this was reported in the city, Messer Donati was banished, and his property forfeited, and the other heads of the sect were proportionally fined and sent into exile. Messer Donati, arriving at Rome, so far prevailed with his Holiness, that he sent an embassy to Charles de Valois, brother to the king of France, declaring his wish that he should be made Emperor, and King of the Romans; under which persuasion Charles passed into Italy, reinstating Messer Donati and the Neri in the city of Florence. From this there only resulted worse evils, inasmuch as all the Bianchi, being the least powerful, were universally oppressed and robbed, and Charles, becoming the enemy of Pope Boniface, conspired his death, because the Pope had not fulfilled his promise of presenting him with an imperial crown. From which events it may be seen that this vile faction was the cause of discord in the cities of Florence and Pistoia, and of the other states of Tuscany; and no Vless to the same source was to be attributed the death of Pope Boniface <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>.”</p>

Hence it is that Dante, who was likewise perfect master of the French, made use of that expression; and I have often been surprised, that it was never understood in that sense; so that I cannot help thinking, that the commentators on this author have often made him say things which he never so much as dreamed of.”</p>

					<p>The Wheel of Fortune was one of the favorite subjects of art and song in the Middle Ages. On a large square of white marble set in the pavement of the nave of the Cathedral at Siena, is the representation of a revolving wheel. Three boys are climbing and clinging at the sides and below; above is a dignified figure with a stern countenance, holding the sceptre and ball. At the four corners are inscriptions from Seneca, Euripides, Aristotle, and Epictetus. The same symbol may be seen also in the wheel-of-fortune windows of many churches; as, for example, that of San Zcno at Verona.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“This Philippo Argenti, as Coppo di Borghese Domenichi de’ Cavicciuli was wont to say, was a very rich gentleman, so rich that he had the horse he used to ride shod with silver, and from this he had his surname; he was in person large, swarthy, muscular, of marvellous strength, and at the slightest provocation the most irascible of men; nor are any more known of his qualities than these two, each in itself very blameworthy,”</p>

					<p>The ancestors of Dante, and Dante himself, were Guelfs. He did not become a Ghibelline till after his banishment.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“He was,” says Boccaccio, “a most excellent man, and most resolute in adversity. It was only on one subject that he showed himself, I do not know whether I ought to call it impatient, or spirited⁠—it was regarding anything relating to Party; since in his exile he was more violent in this respect than suited his circumstances, and more than he was willing that others should believe. And in order that it may be seen for what party he was thus violent and pertinacious, it appears to me I must go further back in my story. I believe that it was the just anger of God that permitted, it is a long time ago, almost all Tuscany and Lombardy to be divided into two parties; I do not know how they acquired those names, but one party was called Guelf and the other party Ghibelline. And these two names were so revered, and had such an effect on the folly of many minds, that, for the sake of defending the side any one had chosen for his own against the opposite party, it was not considered hard to lose property, and even life, if it were necessary. And under these names the Italian cities many times suffered serious grievances and changes; and among the rest our city, which was sometimes at the head of one party, and sometimes of the other, according to the citizens in power; so much so that Dante’s ancestors, being Guelfs, were twice expelled by the Ghibellines from their home, and he likewise under the title of Guelf held the reins of the Florentine Republic, from which he was expelled, as we have shown, not by the Ghibellines, but by the Guelfs; and seeing that he could not return, he so much altered his mind that there never was a fiercer Ghibelline, or a bitterer enemy to the Guelfs, than he was. And that which I feel most ashamed at for the sake of his memory is, that it was a well-known thing in Romagna, that if any boy or girl, talking to him on party matters, condemned the Ghibelline side, he would become frantic, so that if they did not be silent he would have been induced to throw stones at them; and with this violence of party feeling he lived until his death. I am certainly ashamed to tarnish with any fault the fame of such a man; but the order of my subject in some degree demands it, because if I were silent in those things in which he was to blame, I should not be believed in those things I have already related in his praise. Therefore I excuse myself to himself, who perhaps looks down from heaven with a disdainful eye on me writing.”</p>

						<p>“There formerly resided in Germany two wealthy and wellborn individuals, whose names were Guelfo and Ghibellino, very near neighbors, and greatly attached to each other. But returning together one day from the chase, there unfortunately arose some difference of opinion as to the merits of one of their hounds, which was maintained on both sides so very warmly, that, from being almost inseparable friends and companions, they became each other’s deadliest enemies. This unlucky division between them still increasing, they on either side collected parties of their followers, in order more effectually to annoy each other. Soon extending its malignant influence among the neighboring lords and barons of Germany, who divided, according to their motives, either with the Guelf or the Ghibelline, it not only produced many serious affrays, but several persons fell victims to its rage. Ghibellino, finding himself hard pressed by his enemy, and unable longer to keep the field against him, resolved to apply for assistance to Frederick the First, the reigning Emperor. Upon this, Guelfo, perceiving that his adversary sought the alliance of this monarch, applied on his side to Pope Honorius <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, who being at variance with the former, and hearing how the affair stood, immediately joined the cause of the Guelfs, the Emperor having already embraced that of the Ghibellines. It is thus that the apostolic see became connected with the former, and the empire with the latter faction; and it was thus that a vile hound became the origin of a deadly hatred between the two noble families. Now it happened that in the year of our dear Lord and Redeemer 1215, the same pestiferous spirit spread itself into parts of Italy, in the following manner. Messer Guido Orlando being at that time chief magistrate of Florence, there likewise resided in that city a noble and valiant cavalier of the family of Buondclmonti, one of the most distinguished houses in the state. Our young Buondelmonce having already plighted his troth to a lady of the Amidei family, the lovers were considered as betrothed, with all the solemnity usually observed on such occasions. But this unfortunate young man, chancing one day to pass by the house of the Donati, was stopped and accosted by a lady of the name of Lapaccia, who moved to him from her door as he went along, saying: ‘I am surprised that a gentleman of your appearance, Signor, should think of taking for his wife a woman scarcely worthy of handing him his boots. There is a child of my own, whom, to speak sincerely, I have long intended for you, and whom I wish you would just venture to see.’ And on this she called out for her daughter, whose name was Ciulla, one of the prettiest and most enchanting girls in all Florence. Introducing her to Messer Buondelmonte, she whispered, ‘This is she whom I had reserved for you’; and the young Florentine, suddenly becoming enamored of her, thus replied to her mother, ‘I am quite ready. Madonna, to meet your wishes’; and before stirring from the spot he placed a ring upon her finger, and, wedding her, received her there as his wife.</p>
						<p>“The Amidei, hearing that young Buondelmonte had thus espoused another, immediately met together, and took counsel with other friends and relations, how they might best avenge themselves for such an insult offered to their house. There were present among the rest Lambertuccio Amidei, Schiatta Ruberti, and Mosca Lamberti, one of whom proposed to give him a box on the ear, another to strike him in the face; yet they were none of them able to agree about it among themselves. On observing this, Mosca hastily rose, in a great passion, saying, ‘<i xml:lang="it">Cosa fatta capo ha,</i>’ wishing it to be understood that a dead man will never strike again. It was therefore decided that he should be put to death, a sentence which they proceeded to execute in the following manner.</p>
						<p>“<abbr>M.</abbr> Buondelmonte returning one Easter morning from a visit to the Casa Bardi, beyond the Arno, mounted upon a snow-white steed, and dressed in a mantle of the same color, had just reached the foot of the Ponte Vecchio, or old bridge, where formerly stood a statue of Mars, whom the Florentines in their Pagan state were accustomed to worship, when the whole party issued out upon him, and, dragging him in the scuffle from his horse, in spite of the gallant resistance he made, despatched him with a thousand wounds. The tidings of this affair seemed to throw all Florence into confusion; the chief personages and noblest families in the place everywhere meeting, and dividing themselves into parties in consequence; the one party embracing the cause of the Buondelmonti, who placed themselves at the head of the Guelfs; and the other taking part with the Amidei, who supported the Ghibellines.</p>
						<p>“In the same fatal manner, nearly all the seigniories and cities of Italy were involved in the original quarrel between these two German families: the Guelfs still supporting the interest of the Holy Church, and the Ghibellines those of the Emperor. And thus I have made you acquainted with the origin of the Germanic faction, between two noble houses, for the sake of a vile cur, and have shown how it afterwards disturbed the peace of Italy for the sake of a beautiful woman.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“It chanced upon a day that Signior Guido, departing from the Church of Saint Michael d’ Horta, and passing along by the Adamari, so far as to Saint John’s Church, which evermore was his customary walk: many goodly Marble Tombs were then about the said Church, as now adays are at Saint Reparata, and divers more beside. He entring among the Columns of Porphiry, and the other Sepulchers being there, because the door of the Church was shut: Signior Betto and his Company came riding from Saint Reparata, and espying Signior Guido among the Graves and Tombs, said, ‘Come, let us go make some jests to anger him.’ So putting the Spurs to their Horses they rode apace towards him; and being upon him before hee perceived them, one of them said, ‘Guido, thou refusest to be one of our society, and seekest for that which never was: when thou hast found it, tell us, what wilt thou do with it?’</p>
						<p>“Guido seing himself round engirt with them, suddenly thus replyed: ‘Gentlemen, you may use me in your own House as you please.’ And setting his hand upon one of the Tombs (which was somewhat great) he took his rising, and leapt quite over it on the further side, as being of an agile and sprightly body, and being thus freed from them, he went away to his own lodging.</p>
						<p>“They stood all like men amazed, strangely looking one upon another, and began afterward to murmur among themselves: That Guido was a man without any understanding, and the answer which he had made unto them was to no purpose, neither savoured of any discretion, but meerly came from an empty Brain, because they had no more to do in the place where now they were, than any of the other Citizens, and Signior Guido (himself) as little as any of them; whereto Signior Betto thus replyed: ‘Alas, Gentlemen, it is you your selves that are void of understanding: for, if you had but observed the answer which he made unto us: he did honestly, and (in very few words) not only notably express his own wisdom, but also deservedly reprehend us.

						<p>“ ‘It would have been better,’ he exclaimed, ‘to have died on the Arbia, than survive only to hear such a proposition as that which they were then discussing. There is no happiness in victory itself, <em>that</em> must ever be sought for amongst the companions who helped us to gain the day, and the injury we receive from an enemy inflicts a far more trifling wound than the wrong that comes from the hand of a friend. If I now complain, it is not that I fear the destruction of my native city, for as long as I have life to wield a sword Florence shall never be destroyed; but I cannot suppress my indignation at the discourses I have just been listening to: we are here assembled to discuss the wisest means of maintaining our influence in Florence, not to debate on its destruction, and my country would indeed be unfortunate, and I and my companions miserable, mean-spirited creatures, if it were true that the fate of our city depended on the fiat of the present assembly. I did hope that all former hatred would have been banished from such a meeting, and that our mutual destruction would not have been treacherously aimed at from under the false colors of general safety; I did hope that all here were convinced that counsel dictated by jealousy could never be advantageous to the general good! But to what does your hatred attach itself? To the ground on which the city stands? To its houses and insensible walls? To the fugitives who have abandoned it? Or to ourselves that now possess it? Who is he that thus advises? Who is the bold bad man that dare thus give voice to the malice he hath engendered in his soul? Is it meet then that all <em>your</em> cities should exist unharmed, and ours alone be devoted to destruction? That <em>you</em> should return in triumph to your hearths, and we with whom you have conquered should have nothing in exchange but exile and the ruin of our country? Is there one of you who can believe that I could even hear such things with patience? Are you indeed ignorant that if I have carried arms, if I have persecuted my foes, I still have never ceased to love my country, and that I never will allow what even our enemies have respected to be violated by your hands, so that posterity may call <em>them</em> the saviours, <em>us</em> the destroyers of our country? Here then I declare, that, although I stand alone amongst the Florentines, I will never permit my native city to be destroyed, and if it be necessary for her sake to die a thousand deaths, I am ready to meet them all in her defence.’</p>

Villani, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cronica</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 1, thus sketches his character:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“This Frederick reigned thirty years as Emperor, and was a man of great mark and great worth, learned in letters and of natural ability, universal in all things; he knew the Latin language, the Italian, the German, French, Greek, and Arabic; was copiously endowed with all virtues, liberal and courteous in giving, valiant and skilled in arms, and was much feared. And he was dissolute and voluptuous in many ways, and had many concubines and mamelukes, after the Saracenic fashion; he was addicted to all sensual delights, and led an Epicurean life, taking no account of any other; and this was one principal reason why he was an enemy to the clergy and the Holy Church.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Frederick’s predilection for his native kingdom, for the bright cities reflected in the blue Mediterranean, over the dark barbaric towns of Germany, of itself characterizes the man. The summer skies, the more polished manners, the more elegant luxuries, the knowledge, the arts, the poetry, the gayety, the beauty, the romance of the South, were throughout his life more congenial to his mind, than the heavier and more chilly climate, the feudal barbarism, the ruder pomp, the coarser habits of his German liegemen.⁠ ⁠… And no doubt that delicious climate and lovely land, so highly appreciated by the gay sovereign, was not without influence on the state, and even the manners of his court, to which other circumstances contributed to give a peculiar and romantic character. It resembled probably (though its full splendor was of a later period) Grenada in its glory, more than any other in Europe, though more rich and picturesque from the variety of races, of manners, usages, even dresses, which prevailed within it.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Gibbon also, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decline and Fall</i>, <abbr>Chap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LIX</span>, gives this graphic picture:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Frederick the Second, the grandson of Barbarossa, was successively the pupil, the enemy, and the victim of the Church. At the age of twenty-one years, and in obedience to his guardian Innocent the Third, he assumed the cross; the same promise was repeated at his royal and imperial coronations; and his marriage with the heiress of Jerusalem forever bound him to defend the kingdom of his son Conrad. But as Frederick advanced in age and authority, he repented of the rash engagements of his youth: his liberal sense and knowledge taught him to despise the phantoms of superstition and the crowns of Asia: he no longer entertained the same reverence for the successors of Innocent; and his ambition was occupied by the restoration of the Italian monarchy, from Sicily to the Alps. But the success of this project would have reduced the Popes to their primitive simplicity; and, after the delays and excuses of twelve years, they urged the Emperor, with entreaties and threats, to fix the time and place of his departure for Palestine. In the harbors of Sicily and Apulia he prepared a fleet of one hundred galleys, and of one hundred vessels, that were framed to transport and land two thousand five hundred knights, with horses and attendants; his vassals of Naples and Germany formed a powerful army; and the number of English crusaders was magnified to sixty thousand by the report of fame. But the inevitable, or affected, slowness of these mighty preparations consumed the strength and provisions of the more indigent pilgrims; the multitude was thinned by sickness and desertion, and the sultry summer of Calabria anticipated the mischiefs of a Syrian campaign. At length the Emperor hoisted sail at Brundusium with a fleet and army of forty thousand men; but he kept the sea no more than three days; and his hasty retreat, which was ascribed by his friends to a grievous indisposition, was accused by his enemies as a voluntary and obstinate disobedience. For suspending his vow was Frederick excommunicated by Gregory the Ninth; for presuming, the next year, to accomplish his vow, he was again excommunicated by the same Pope. While he served under the banner of the cross, a crusade was preached against him in Italy; and after his return he was compelled to ask pardon for the injuries which he had suffered. The clergy and military orders of Palestine were previously instructed to renounce his communion and dispute his commands; and in his own kingdom the Emperor was forced to consent that the orders of the camp should be issued in the name of God and of the Christian republic. Frederick entered Jerusalem in triumph; and with his own hands (for no priest would perform the office) he took the crown from the altar of the holy sepulchre.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Matthew Paris, <abbr epub:type="se:era">AD</abbr> 1239, gives a long letter of Pope Gregory <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> in which he calls the Emperor some very hard names; “a beast, full of the words of blasphemy,” “a wolf in sheep’s clothing,” “a son of lies,” “a staff of the impious,” and “hammer of the earth”; and finally accuses him of being the author of a work <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">De Tribus Impostoribus</i>, which, if it ever existed, is no longer to be found:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“There is one thing,” he says in conclusion, “at which, although we ought to mourn for a lost man, you ought to rejoice greatly, and for which you ought to return thanks to God, namely, that this man, who delights in being called a forerunner of Antichrist, by God’s will, no longer endures to be veiled in darkness; not expecting that his trial and disgrace arc near, he with his own hands undermines the wall of his abominations, and, by the said letters of his, brings his works of darkness to the light, boldly setting forth in them, that he could not be excommunicated by us, although the Vicar of Christ; thus affirming that the Church had not the power of binding and loosing, which was given by our Lord to <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter and his successors.⁠ ⁠… But as it may not be easily believed by some people that he has ensnared himself by the words of his own mouth, proofs are ready, to the triumph of the faith; for this king of pestilence openly asserts that the whole world was deceived by three, namely Christ Jesus, Moses, and Muhammad; that, two of them having died in glory, the said Jesus was suspended on the cross; and he, moreover, presumes plainly to affirm (or rather to lie), that all are foolish who believe that God, who created nature, and could do all things, was born of the Virgin.”</p>

This degenerate successor of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter is not admitted to the rank of a saint.

For they circumvented the needy in their necessities, cloaking their usury under the show of trade, and pretending not to know that whatever is added to the principal is usury, under whatever name it may be called. For it is manifest that their loans lie not in the path of charity, inasmuch as they do not hold out a helping hand to the poor to relieve them, but to deceive them; not to aid others in their starvation, but to gratify their own covetousness; seeing that the motive stamps our every deed.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“At the top of the abyss of the seventh circle, appointed for the ‘violent,’ or souls who had done evil by force, we are told, first, that the edge of it was composed of ‘great broken stones in a circle’; then, that the place was ‘Alpine’; and, becoming hereupon attentive, in order to hear what an Alpine place is like, we find that it was ‘like the place beyond Trent, where the rock, either by earthquake, or failure of support, has broken down to the plain, so that it gives any one at the top some means of getting down to the bottom.’ This is not a very elevated or enthusiastic description of an Alpine scene; and it is far from mended by the following verses, in which we are told that Dante ‘began to go down by this great <em>unloading</em> of stones,’ and that they moved often under his feet by reason of the new weight. The fact is that Dante, by many expressions throughout the poem, shows himself to have been a notably bad climber; and being fond of sitting in the sun, looking at his fair Baptistery, or walking in a dignified manner on flat pavement in a long robe, it puts him seriously out of his way when he has to take to his hands and knees, or look to his feet; so that the first strong impression made upon him by any Alpine scene whatever is, clearly, that it is bad walking. When he is in a fright and hurry, and has a very steep place to go down, Virgil has to carry him altogether.”</p>

						<p>“The descent becomes more rapid between Roveredo and Ala; the river, which glided gently through the valley of Trent, assumes the roughness of a torrent; the defiles become narrower; and the mountains break into rocks and precipices, which occasionally approach the road, sometimes rise perpendicular from it, and now and then hang over it in terrible majesty.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Amid these wilds the traveller cannot fail to notice a vast tract called the Slavini di Marco, covered with fragments of rock torn from the sides of the neighboring mountains by an earthquake, or perhaps by their own unsupported weight, and hurled down into the plains below. They spread over the whole valley, and in some places contract the road to a very narrow space. A few firs and cypresses scattered in the intervals, or sometimes rising out of the crevices of the rocks, cast a partial and melancholy shade amid the surrounding nakedness and desolation.

						<p>“The actual separation of the elements one from another is produced by discord; for originally they were bound together in the sphere, and therein continued perfectly unmovable.

And so, when his scholars had grown up, and grown old, and were trotting their grandchildren on their knees, they told them about the sports of their school days; and these young folks took the idea that their grandfathers had been taught their letters by a Centaur, half man and half horse.⁠ ⁠…</p>

For instance, Dante’s Centaur, Chiron, dividing his beard with his arrow before he can speak, is a thing that no mortal would ever have thought of, if he had not actually seen the Centaur do it. They might have composed handsome bodies of men and horses in all possible ways, through a whole life of pseudo-idealism, and yet never dreamed of any such thing.

						<p>“Ezzolino was small of stature,” says Sismondi, “but the whole aspect of his person, all his movements, indicated the soldier. His language was bitter, his countenance proud; and by a single look, he made the boldest tremble. His soul, so greedy of all crimes, felt no attraction for sensual pleasures.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Once upon a time Messer Azzolino da Romano made proclamation, through his own territories and elsewhere, that he wished to do a great charity, and therefore that all the beggars, both men and women, should assemble in his meadow, on a certain day, and to each he would give a new gown, and abundance of food. The news spread among the servants on all hands. When the day of assembling came, his seneschals went among them with the gowns and the food, and made them strip naked one by one, and then clothed them with new clothes, and fed them. They asked for their old rags, but it was all in vain; for he put them into a heap and set fire to them. Afterwards he found there so much gold and silver melted, that it more than paid the expense, and then he dismissed them with his blessing.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“To tell you how much he was feared, would be a long story, and many people know it. But I will recall how he, being one day with the Emperor on horseback, with all their people, they laid a wager as to which of them had the most beautiful sword. The Emperor drew from its sheath his own, which was wonderfully garnished with gold and precious stones. Then said Messer Azzolino: ‘It is very beautiful; but mine, without any great ornament, is far more beautiful’;⁠—and he drew it forth. Then six hundred knights, who were with him, all drew theirs. When the Emperor beheld this cloud of swords, he said: ‘Yours is the most beautiful.’ ”</p>

During these proceedings Prince Henry, while taking the sacrament in the church of San Silvestro at Viterbo, was stabbed to the heart by his own cousin, Guy de Montfort, in revenge for the Earl of Leicester’s death, although Henry was then endeavoring to procure his pardon. This sacrilegious act threw Viterbo into confusion, but Montfort had many supporters, one of whom asked him what he had done. ‘<em>I have taken my revenge,</em>’ said he. ‘<em>But your father’s body was trailed!</em>’ At this reproach, De Montfort instantly reentered the church, walked straight to the altar, and, seizing Henry’s body by the hair, dragged it through the aisle, and left it, still bleeding, in the open street: he then retired unmolested to the castle of his father-in-law.

The haughty step and demeanor of the King of the Huns expressed the consciousness of his superiority above the rest of mankind; and he had a custom of fiercely rolling his eyes, as if he wished to enjoy the terror which he inspired.”</p>

					<p>The Cecina is a small river running into the Mediterranean not many miles south of Leghorn; Corneto, a village in the Papal States, north of Civita Vecchia. The country is wild and thinly peopled, and studded with thickets, the haunts of the deer and the wild boar. This region is the fatal Maremma, thus described by Forsyth, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Italy</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 156:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Farther south is the Maremma, a region which, though now worse than a desert, is supposed to have been anciently both fertile and healthy. The Maremma certainly formed part of that Etruria which was called from its harvests the <i xml:lang="it">annonaria</i>. Old Roman cisterns may still be traced, and the ruins of Populonium are still visible in the worst part of this tract: yet both nature and man seem to have conspired against it.</p>
						<p>“Sylla threw this maritime part of Tuscany into enormous <em>latifundia</em> for his disbanded soldiers. Similar distributions continued to lessen its population during the Empire. In the younger Pliny’s time the climate was pestilential. The Lombards gave it a new aspect of misery. Wherever they found culture they built castles, and to each castle they allotted a ‘bandita’ or military fief. Hence baronial wars which have left so many picturesque ruins on the hills, and such desolation round them. Whenever a baron was conquered, his vassals escaped to the cities, and the vacant fief was annexed to the victorious. Thus stripped of men, the lands returned into a state of nature: some were flooded by the rivers, others grew into horrible forests, which enclose and concentrate the pestilence ofthe lakes and marshes.</p>
						<p>“In some parts the water is brackish, and lies lower than the sea: in others it oozes full of tartar from beds of travertine. At the bottom or on the sides of hills are a multitude of hot springs, which form pools, called <em>Lagoni</em>. A few of these are said to produce borax: some, which are called <i xml:lang="it">fumache</i>, exhale sulphur; others, called <i xml:lang="it">bulicami</i>, boil with a mephitic gas. The very air above is only a pool of vapors, which sometimes undulate, but seldom flow off. It draws corruption from a rank, unshorn, rotting vegetation, from reptiles and fish both living and dead.</p>
						<p>“All nature conspires to drive man away from this fatal region; but man will ever return to his bane, if it be well baited. The Casentine peasants still migrate hither in the winter to feed their cattle: and here they sow corn, make charcoal, saw wood, cut hoops, and peel cork. When summer returns they decamp, but often too late; for many leave their corpses on the road, or bring home the Maremmian disease.”</p>

They are fowls with virgin faces, most loathsome is their bodily discharge, hands hooked, and looks ever pale with famine.

We rush upon them with our swords, and invoke the gods and Jove himself to share the booty. Then along the winding shore we raise the couches, and feast on the rich repast. But suddenly, with direful swoop, the Harpies are upon us from the mountains, shake their wings with loud din, prey upon our banquet, and defile everything with their touch: at the same time, together with a rank smell, hideous screams arise.”</p>

						<p>“Near at hand there chanced to be a rising ground, on whose top were young cornel-trees, and a myrtle rough with thick, spear-like branches. I came up to it, and attempting to tear from the earth the verdant wood, that I might cover the altars with the leafy boughs, I observe a dreadful prodigy, and wondrous to relate. For from that tree which first is torn from the soil, its rooted fibres being burst asunder, drops of black blood distil, and stain the ground with gore: cold terror shakes my limbs, and my chill blood is congealed with fear. I again essay to tear off a limber bough from another, and thoroughly explore the latent cause: and from the rind of that other the purple blood descends. Raising in my mind many an anxious thought, I with reverence besought the rural nymphs, and father Mars, who presides over the Thracian territories, kindly to prosper the vision and avert evil from the omen. But when I at tempted the boughs a third time with a more vigorous effort, and on my knees struggled against the opposing mould, (shall I speak, or shall I forbear?) a piteous groan is heard from the bottom of the rising ground, and a voice sent forth reaches my ears: ‘Aeneas, why dost thou tear an unhappy wretch? Spare me, now that I am in my grave; forbear to pollute with guilt thy pious hands: Troy brought me forth no stranger to you; nor is it from the trunk this blood distils.’ ”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The fate of his friend and minister, Piero delle Vigne of Capua, if truly told, would nevertheless impress us with an unfavorable idea of his mercy and magnanimity: Piero was sent with Taddeo di Sessa as Frederick’s advocate and representative to the Council of Lyons, which was assembled by his friend Innocent the Fourth, nominally to reform the Church, but really to impart more force and solemnity to a fresh sentence of excommunication and deposition. There Taddeo spoke with force and boldness for his master; but Piero was silent; and hence he was accused of being, like several others, bribed by the Pope, not only to desert the Emperor, but to attempt his life; and whether he were really culpable, or the victim of court intrigue, is still doubtful. Frederick, on apparently good evidence, condemned him to have his eyes burned out, and the sentence was executed at San Miniato al Tedesco: being afterwards sent on horseback to Pisa, where he was hated, as an object for popular derison, he died, as is conjectured, from the effects of a fall while thus cruelly exposed, and not by his own hand, as Dante believed and sung,”</p>

					<p>Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 499, gives the story thus:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Peter de Vineâ had been raised by the wise choice of Frederick to the highest rank and influence. All the acts of Frederick were attributed to his Chancellor. De Vineâ, like his master, was a poet; he was one of the counsellors in his great scheme of legislation. Some rumors spread abroad that at the Council of Lyons, though Frederick had forbidden all his representatives from holding private intercourse with the Pope, De Vineâ had many secret conferences with Innocent, and was accused of betraying his master’s interests. Yet there was no seeming diminution in the trust placed in De Vineâ. Still, to the end the Emperor’s letters concerning the disaster at Parma are by the same hand. Over the cause of his disgrace and death, even in his own day, there was deep doubt and obscurity. The popular rumor ran that Frederick was ill; the physician of De Vineâ prescribed for him; the Emperor having received some warning, addressed De Vineâ: ‘My friend, in thee I have full trust; art thou sure that this is medicine, not poison?’ De Vineâ replied: ‘How often has my physician ministered healthful medicines!⁠—why are you now afraid?’ Frederick took the cup, sternly commanded the physician to drink half of it. The physician threw himself at the King’s feet, and, as he fell, overthrew the liquor. But what was left was administered to some criminals, who died in agony. The Emperor wrung his hands and wept bitterly: ‘Whom can I now trust, betrayed by my own familiar friend? Never can I know security, never can I know joy more.’ By one account Peter de Vineâ was led ignominiously on an ass through Pisa, and thrown into prison, where he dashed his brains out against the wall. Dante’s immortal verse has saved the fame of De Vineâ: according to the poet he was the victim of wicked and calumnious jealousy.”</p>

					<p>Brunetto Latini, Dante’s friend and teacher. Villani thus speaks of him, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cronica</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 10:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In this year 1294 died in Florence a worthy citizen, whose name was Ser Brunetto Latini, who was a great philosopher and perfect master of rhetoric, both in speaking and in writing. He commented the Rhetoric of Tully, and made the good and useful book called the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tesoro</i>, and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i>, and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Keys of the Tesoro</i>, and many other books of philosophy, and of vices and of virtues, and he was Secretary of our Commune, He was a worldly man, but we have made mention of him because he was the first master in refining the Florentines, and in teaching them how to speak correctly, and how to guide and govern our Republic on political principles.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Boccaccio, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Comento</i>, speaks of him thus:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“This Ser Brunetto Latini was a Florentine, and a very able man in some of the liberal arts, and in philosophy; but his principal calling was that of Notary; and he held himself and his calling in such great esteem, that, having made a mistake in a contract drawn up by him, and having been in consequence accused of fraud, he preferred to be condemned for it rather than to confess that he had made a mistake; and afterwards he quitted Florence in disdain, and leaving in memory of himself a book composed by him, called the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i>, he went to Paris and lived there a long time, and composed a book there which is in French, and in which he treats of many matters regarding the liberal arts, and moral and natural philosophy, and metaphysics, which he called the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tesoro</i>; and finally, I believe, he died in Paris.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>He also wrote a short poem, called the “<i xml:lang="it">Favoletto</i>,” and perhaps the “<i xml:lang="it">Pataffio</i>,” a satirical poem in the Florentine dialect, “a jargon,” says Nardini, “which cannot be understood even with a commentary.” But his fame rests upon the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i> and the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tesoro</i>, and more than all upon the fact that he was Dante’s teacher, and was put by him into a very disreputable place in the Inferno. He died in Florence, not in Paris, as Boccaccio supposes, and was buried in Santa Maria Novella, where his tomb still exists. It is strange that Boccaccio should not have known this, as it was in this church that the “seven young gentlewomen” of his Decameron met “on a Tuesday morning,” and resolved to go together into the country, where they “might hear the birds sing, and see the verdure of the hills and plains, and the fields full of grain undulating like the sea.”</p>
					<p>The poem of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i>, written in a jingling metre, which reminds one of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Vision of Piers Ploughman</i>, is itself a Vision, with the customary allegorical personages of the Virtues and Vices. Ser Brunetto, returning from an embassy to King Alphonso of Spain, meets on the plain of Roncesvalles a student of Bologna, riding on a bay mule, who informs him that the Guelfs have been banished from Florence. Whereupon Ser Brunetto, plunged in meditation and sorrow, loses the high road and wanders in a wondrous forest. Here he discovers the august and gigantic figure of Nature, who relates to him the creation of the world, and gives him a banner to protect him on his pilgrimage through the forest, in which he meets with no adventures, but with the Virtues and Vices, Philosophy, Fortune, Ovid, and the God of Love, and sundry other characters, which are sung at large through eight or ten chapters. He then emerges from the forest, and confesses himself to the monks of Montpellier; after which he goes back into the forest again, and suddenly finds himself on the summit of Olympus; and the poem abruptly leaves him discoursing about the elements with Ptolemy,</p>

					<p>It has been supposed by some commentators that Dante was indebted to the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i> for the first idea of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Commedia</i>. “If any one is pleased to imagine this,” says the Abbate Zannoni in the Preface to his edition of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Tesoretto</i>, (Florence, 1824,) “he must confess that a slight and almost invisible spark served to kindle a vast conflagration.”</p>
					<p>The <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tesoro</i>, which is written in French, is a much more ponderous and pretentious volume.

						<p>“The smallest part of this Treasure is like unto ready money, to be expended daily in things needful; that is, it treats of the beginning of time, of the antiquity of old histories, of the creation of the world, and in fine of the nature of all things.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“The second part, which treats of the vices and virtues, is of precious stones, which give unto man delight and virtue; that is to say, what things a man should do, and what he should not, and shows the reason why.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“The third part of the Treasure is of fine gold; that is to say, it teaches a man to speak according to the rules of rhetoric, and how a ruler ought to govern those beneath him.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“And I say not that this book is extracted from my own poor sense and my own naked knowledge, but, on the contrary, it is like a honeycomb gathered from diverse flowers; for this book is wholly compiled from the wonderful sayings of the authors who before our time have treated of philosophy, each one according to his knowledge.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“And if any one should ask why this book is written in Romance, according to the language of the French, since we are Italian, I should say it is for two reasons; one, because we are in France, and the other, because this speech is more delectable, and more common to all people.”</p>

Then they built upon the plain, which is at the foot of the high rocks on which that city stood, another city, that is now called Florence. And know that the spot of ground where Florence stands was formerly called the House of Mars, that is to say the House of War; for Mars, who is one of the seven planets, is called the God of War, and as such was worshipped of old. Therefore it is no wonder that the Florentines are always in war and in discord, for that planet reigns over them. Of this Master Brunez Latins ought to know the truth, for he was born there, and was in exile on account of war with the Florentines, when he composed this book.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Emperor Otho <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, being by chance in Florence and having gone to the festival of <abbr>St.</abbr> John, to make it more gay with his presence, it happened that to the church with the other city dames, as our custom is, came the wife of Messer Berto, and brought with her a daughter of hers called Gualdrada, who was still unmarried. And as they sat there with the others, the maiden being beautiful in face and figure, nearly all present turned round to look at her, and among the rest the Emperor. And having much commended her beauty and manners, he asked Messer Berto, who was near him, who she was. To which Messer Berto smiling answered: ‘She is the daughter of one who, I dare say, would let you kiss her if you wished.’ These words the young lady heard, being near the speaker; and somewhat troubled by the opinion her father seemed to have of her, that, if he wished it, she would suffer herself to be kissed by any one in this free way, rising, and looking a moment at her father, and blushing with shame, said: ‘Father, do not make such courteous promises at the expense of my modesty, for certainly, unless by violence, no one shall ever kiss me, except him whom you shall give me as my husband.’ The Emperor, on hearing this, much commended the words and the young lady.⁠ ⁠… And calling forward a noble youth named Guido Beisangue, who was afterwards called Guido the Elder, who as yet had no wife, he insisted upon his marrying her; and gave him as her dowry a large territory in Cassentino and the Alps, and made him Count thereof.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Ampère says in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Voyage Dantesque</i>, page 242:⁠—</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“It came to pass, that, whilst by spending nothing he went on accumulating wealth, there came to Genoa a well-bred and witty gentleman called Gulielmo Borsiere, one nothing like the courtiers of the present day; who, to the great reproach of the debauched dispositions of such as would now be reputed fine gentlemen, should more properly style themselves asses, brought up amidst the filthiness and sink of mankind, rather than in courts.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“This Gulielmo, whom I before mentioned, was much visited and respected by the better sort of people at Genoa; when having made some stay here, and hearing much talk of Ermino’s sordidness, he became desirous of seeing him. Now Ermino had been informed of Gulielmo’s worthy character, and having, however covetous he was, some small sparks of gentility, he received him in a courteous manner, and, entering into discourse together, he took him, and some Genoese who came along with him, to see a fine house which he had lately built: and when he had showed every part of it, he said: ‘Pray, sir, can you, who have heard and seen so much, tell me of something that was never yet seen, to have painted in my hall?’ To whom Gulielmo, hearing him speak so simply, replied: ‘Sir, I can tell you of nothing which has never yet been seen, that I know of; unless it be sneezing, or some thing of that sort; but if you please, I can tell you of a thing which, I believe, you never saw.’ Said Ermmo (little expecting such an answer as he received), ‘I beg you would let me know what that is.’ Gulielmo immediately replied, ‘Paint Liberality.’ When Ermino heard this, such a sudden shame seized him, as quite changed his temper from what it had hitherto been; and he said: ‘Sir, I will have her painted in such a manner that neither you, nor any one else, shall be able to say, hereafter, that I am unacquainted with her.’ And from that time such effect had Gulielmo’s words upon him, he became the most liberal and courteous gentleman, and was the most respected, both by strangers and his own citizens, of any in Genoa.”</p>

					<p>Monte Veso is among the Alps, between Piedmont and Savoy, where the Po takes its rise. From this point eastward to the Adriatic, all the rivers on the left or northern slope of the Apennines are tributaries to the Po, until we come to the Montone, which above Forli is called Acquacheta. This is the first which flows directly into the Adriatic, and not into the Po. At least it was so in Dante’s time. Now, by some change in its course, the Lamone, farther north, has opened itself a new outlet, and is the first to make its own way to the Adriatic. See Barlow, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Contributions to the Study of the Divine Comedy</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 131. This comparison shows the delight which Dante took in the study of physical geography.

					<p>Boccaccio’s interpretation of this line, which has been adopted by most of the commentators since his time, is as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“I was for a long time in doubt concerning the author’s meaning in this line; but being by chance at this monastery of San Benedetto, in company with the abbot, he told me that there had once been a discussion among the Counts who owned the mountain, about building a village near the waterfall, as a convenient place for a settlement, and bringing into it their vassals scattered on neighboring farms; but the leader of the project dying, it was not carried into effect; and that is what the author says, <i xml:lang="it">Ove dovea per mille</i>, that is, for many, <i xml:lang="it">esser ricetto</i>, that is, home and habitation.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Doubtless grammatically the words will bear this meaning. But evidently the idea in the author’s mind, and which he wished to impress upon the reader’s, was that of a waterfall plunging at a single leap down a high precipice. To this idea, the suggestion of buildings and inhabitants is wholly foreign, and adds neither force nor clearness. Whereas, to say that the river plunged at one bound over a precipice high enough for a thousand cascades, presents at once a vivid picture to the imagination, and I have interpreted the line accordingly, making the contrast between <i xml:lang="it">una scesa</i> and <i xml:lang="it">mille</i>. It should not be forgotten that, while some editions read <i xml:lang="it">dovea</i>, others read <i xml:lang="it">dovria</i>, and even <i xml:lang="it">potria</i>. <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-230" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This cord has puzzled the commentators exceedinglv. Boccaccio, Volpi, and Venturi do not explain it. The anonymous author of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ottimo</i>, Benvenuto da Imola, Buti, Landino, Vellutello, and Daniello, all think it means fraud, which Dante had used in the pursuit of pleasure⁠—“the panther with the paintedskin.” Lombardi is of opinion that, “by girding himself with the Franciscan cord, he had endeavored to restrain his sensual appetites, indicated by the panther; and still wearing the cord as a Tertiary of the Order, he makes it serve here to deceive Geryon, and bring him up.” Biagioli understands by it “the humility with which a man should approach Science, because it is she that humbles the proud.” Fraticelli thinks it means vigilance; Tommaseo, “the good faith with which he hoped to win the Florentines, and now wishes to deal with their fraud, so that it may not harm him”; and Gabrielli Rossetti says, “Dante flattered himself, acting as a sincere Ghibelline, that he should meet with good faith from his Guelf countrymen, and met instead with horrible fraud.”</p>
					<p>Dante elsewhere speaks of the cord in a good sense. In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Purgatorio</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> 114, Peter of Aragon is “girt with the cord of every virtue,” In <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Inferno</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXVII</span> 92, it is mortification, “the cord that used to make those girt with it more meagre”; and in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Paradiso</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> 87, it is humility, “that family which had already girt the humble cord.”</p>
					<p>It will be remembered that <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis, the founder of the Cordeliers (the wearers of the cord), used to call his body <i xml:lang="it">asino</i>, or ass, and to subdue it with the <i xml:lang="it">capestro</i>, or halter. Thus the cord is made to symbolize the subjugation of the animal nature. This renders Lombardi’s interpretation the most intelligible and satisfactory, though Virgil seems to have thrown the cord into the abyss simply because he had nothing else to throw, and not with the design of deceiving. <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-231" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The monster Geryon, here used as the symbol of Fraud, was born of Chrysaor and Callirrhoe, and is generally represented by the poets as having three bodies and three heads. He was in ancient times King of Hesperia or Spain, living on Erytheia, the Red Island of sunset, and was slain by Hercules, who drove away his beautiful oxen. The nimble fancy of Hawthorne thus depicts him in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Wonder-Book</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 148:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“But was it really and truly an old man? Certainly at first sight it looked very like one; but on closer inspection, it rather seemed to be some kind of a creature that lived in the sea. For on his legs and arms there were scales, such as fishes have; he was web-footed and web-fingered, after the fashion of a duck; and his long beard, being of a greenish tinge, had more the appearance of a tuft of seaweed than of an ordinary beard. Have you never seen a stick of timber, that has been long tossed about by the waves, and has got all overgrown with barnacles, and at last, drifting ashore, seems to have been thrown up from the very deepest bottom of the sea? Well, the old man would have put you in mind of just such a wave-tost spar.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The three bodies and three heads, which old poetic fable has given to the monster Geryon, are interpreted by modern prose as meaning the three Balearic Islands, Majorca, Minorca, and Ivica, over which he reigned. <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-235" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“Our slates and granites are often of very lovely colors; but the Apennine limestone is so gray and toneless, that I know not any mountain district so utterly melancholy as those which are composed of this rock, when unwoodcd. Now, as far as I can discover from the internal evidence in his poem, nearly all Dante’s mountain wanderings had been upon this ground. He had journeyed once or twice among the Alps, indeed, but seems to have been impressed chiefly by the road from Garda to Trent, and that along the Cornice, both of which are either upon those limestones, or a dark serpentine, which shows hardly any color till it is polished. It is not ascertainable that he had ever seen rock scenery of the finely colored kind, aided by the Alpine mosses: I do not know the fall at Forli (<i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Inferno</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span> 99), but every other scene to which he alludes is among these Apennine limestones; and when he wishes to give the idea of enormous mountain size, he names Tabernicch and Pietra-pana⁠—the one clearly chosen only for the sake of the last syllable of its name, in order to make a sound as of crackling ice, with the two sequent rhymes of the stanza⁠—and the other is an Apennine near Lucca.</p>
						<p>“His idea, therefore, of rock color, founded on these experiences, is that of a dull or ashen gray, more or less stained by the brown of iron ochre, precisely as the Apennine limestones nearly always are; the gray being peculiarly cold and disagreeable. As we go down the very hill which stretches out from Pietra-pana towards Lucca, the stones laid by the roadside to mend it are of this ashen gray, with efflorescences of manganese and iron in the fissures. The whole of Malebolge is made of this rock, ‘All wrought in stone of iron-colored grain.’ ”</p>

					<p>The year of Jubilee 1300. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Norton, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Notes of Travel and Study in Italy</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 255, thus describes it:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The beginning of the new century brought many pilgrims to the Papal city, and the Pope, seeing to what account the treasury of indulgences possessed by the Church might now be turned, hit upon the plan of promising plenary indulgence to all who, during the year, should visit with fit dispositions the holy places of Rome. He accordingly, in the most solemn manner, proclaimed a year of Jubilee, to date from the Christmas of 1299, and appointed a similar celebration for each hundredth year thereafter. The report of the marvellous promise spread rapidly through Europe; and as the year advanced, pilgrims poured into Italy from remote as well as from neighboring lands. The roads leading to Rome were dusty with bands of travellers pressing forward to gain the unwonted indulgence. The Crusades had made travel familiar to men, and a journey to Rome seemed easy to those who had dreamed of the Farther East, of Constantinople, and Jerusalem. Giovanni Villani, who was among the pilgrims from Florence, declares that there were never less than two hundred thousand strangers at Rome during the year; and Guglielmo Ventura, the chronicler of Asti, reports the total number of pilgrims at not less than two millions. The picture which he draws of Rome during the Jubilee is a curious one. <i xml:lang="la">‘Mirandum est quod passim ibant viri et mulieres, qui anno illo Romæ fuerunt quo ego ibi fui et per dies <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XV</span> steti. De pane, vino, carnibus, piscibus, et avena, bonum mercatum ibi erat; fænum carissimum ibi fuit; hospitia carissima; taliter quod lectus meus et equi mei super fœno et avena constabat mihi tornesium unum grossum. Exiens de Roma in Vigilia Nativitatis Christi, vidi turbam magnam, quam dinumerare nemo pot erat; et fama erat inter Romanos, quod ibi fuerant plusquam vigenti centum millia virorum et mulierum. Pluries ego vidi ibi tam viros quam mulieres conculcatos sub pedibus aliorum; et etiam egomet in eodem periculo plures vices evasi. Papa innumerabilem pecuntam ab eisdem recepit, quia die ac nocte duo clerici stabant ad altare Sancti Pauli tenentes in corum manibus rastellos, rastellantes pecuniam infinitam.’</i> To accommodate the throng of pilgrims, and to protect them as far as possible from the danger which Ventura feelingly describes, a barrier was erected along the middle of the bridge under the castle of Sant’ Angelo, so that those going to <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s and those coming from the church, passing on opposite sides, might not interfere with each other. It seems not unlikely that Dante himself was one of the crowd who thus crossed the old bridge, over whose arches, during this year, a flood of men was flowing almost as constantly as the river’s flood ran through below.”</p>

					<p>This is the Boniface who frightened Celestine from the papacy, and persecuted him to death after his resignation. “The lovely Lady” is the Church. The fraud was his collusion with Charles <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> of Naples. “He went to King Charles by night, secretly, and with few attendants,” says Villani, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> <abbr>ch.</abbr> 6, “and said to him: ‘King, thy Pope Celestine had the will and the power to serve thee in thy Sicilian wars, but did not know how: but if thou wilt contrive with thy friends the cardinals to have me elected Pope, I shall know how, and shall have the will and the power’; promising upon his faith and oath to aid him with all the power of the Church.” Farther on he continues: “He was very magnanimous and lordly, and demanded great honor, and knew well how to maintain and advance the cause of the Church, and on account of his knowledge and power was much dreaded and feared. He was avaricious exceedingly in order to aggrandize the Church and his relations, not being over-scrupulous about gains, for he said that all things were lawful which were of the Church.”</p>
					<p>He was chosen Pope in 1294. “The inauguration of Boniface,” says Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span>, <abbr>ch.</abbr> 7, “was the most magnificent which Rome had ever beheld. In his procession to <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s and back to the Lateran palace, where he was entertained, he rode not a humble ass, but a noble white horse, richly caparisoned: he had a crown on his head; the King of Naples held the bridle on one side, his son, the King of Hungary, on the other. The nobility of Rome, the Orsinis, the Colonnas, the Savellis, the Stefaneschi, the Annibaldi, who had not only welcomed him to Rome, but conferred on him the Senatorial dignity, followed in a body: the procession could hardly force its way through the masses of the kneeling people. In the midst, a furious hurricane burst over the city, and extinguished every lamp and torch in the church. A darker omen followed: a riot broke out among the populace, in which forty lives were lost. The day after, the Pope dined in public in the Lateran; the two Kings waited behind his chair.”</p>
					<p>Dante indulges towards him a fierce Ghibelline hatred, and assigns him his place of torment before he is dead.

						<p>“But in no part of the poem do we find allusion to mountains in any other than a stern light; nor the slightest evidence that Dante cared to look at them. From that hill of San Miniato, whose steps he knew so well, the eye commands, at the farther extremity of the Val d’ Arno, the whole purple range of the mountains of Carrara, peaked and mighty, seen always against the sunset light in silent outline, the chief forms that rule the scene as twilight fades away. By this vision Dante seems to have been wholly unmoved, and, but for Lucan’s mention of Aruns at Luna, would seemingly not have spoken of the Carrara hills in the whole course of his poem: when he does allude to them, he speaks of their white marble, and their command of stars and sea, but has evidently no regard for the hills themselves. There is not a single phrase or syllable throughout the poem which indicates such a regard. Ugolino, in his dream, seemed to himself to be in the mountains, ‘by cause of which the Pisan cannot see Lucca’; and it is impossible to look up from Pisa to that hoary slope without remembering the awe that there is in the passage; nevertheless it was as a hunting-ground only that he remembered these hills. Adam of Brescia, tormented with eternal thirst, remembers the hills of Romena, but only for the sake of their sweet waters.”</p>

						<p>“As the Count was standing one day in the large and beautiful square of Forli, there came a rustic mountaineer and gave him a basket of pears.

And on returning he said that it was impossible it should rain that day. But the rustic obstinately affirming what he had said, Guido asked him, ‘How dost thou know?’ The rustic answered, ‘Because today my ass, in coming out of the stable, shook his head and pricked up his ears, and whenever he does this, it is a certain sign that the weather will soon change.’ Then Guido replied, ‘Supposing this to be so, how dost thou know there will be much rain?’ ‘Because,’ said he, ‘my ass, with his ears pricked up, turned his head aside, and wheeled about more than usual.’ Then, with the Count’s leave, the rustic departed in haste, much fearing the rain, though the weather was very clear. And an hour afterwards, lo, it began to thunder, and there was a great down-pouring of waters, like a deluge. Then Guido began to cry out, with great indignation and derision, ‘Who has deluded me? Who has put me to shame?’ And for a long time this was a great source of merriment among the people.”</p>

					<p>Of the Arsenal of Venice <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Hillard thus speaks in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Six Months in Italy</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 63:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“No reader of Dante will fail to pay a visit to the Arsenal, from which, in order to illustrate the terrors of his ‘Inferno,’ the great poet drew one of these striking and picturesque images, characteristic alike of the boldness and the power of his genius, which never hesitated to look for its materials among the homely details and familiar incidents of life. In his hands, the boiling of pitch and the calking of seams ascend to the dignity of poetry. Besides, it is the most impressive and characteristic spot in Venice. The Ducal Palace and the Church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Mark’s are symbols of pride and power, but the strength of Venice resided here. Her whole history, for six hundred years, was here epitomized, and as she rose and sunk, the hum of labor here swelled and subsided. Here was the indexhand which marked the culmination and decline of her greatness. Built upon several small islands, which are united by a wall of two miles in circuit, its extent and completeness, decayed as it is, show what the naval power of Venice once was, as the disused armor of a giant enables us to measure his stature and strength. Near the entrance are four marble lions, brought by Morosini from the Peloponnesus in 1685, two of which are striking works of art. Of these two, one is by far the oldest thing in Venice, being not much younger than the battle of Marathon; and thus, from the height of twenty-three centuries, entitled to look down upon <abbr>St.</abbr> Mark’s as the growth of yesterday. The other two are nondescript animals, of the class commonly called heraldic, and can be styled lions only by courtesy. In the armory are some very interesting objects, and none more so than the great standard of the Turkish admiral, made of crimson silk, taken at the battle of Lepanto, and which Cervantes may have grasped with his unwounded hand. A few fragments of some of the very galleys that were engaged in that memorable fight are also preserved here.”</p>

					<p>Napier, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Florentine History</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 214⁠–⁠217, gives this description of the Carroccio and the Martinella of the Florentines:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In order to give more dignity to the national army and form a rallying point for the troops, there had been established a great car, called the Carroccio, drawn by two beautiful oxen, which, carrying the Florentine standard, generally accompanied them into the field. This car was painted vermilion, the bullocks were covered with scarlet cloth, and the driver, a man or some consequence, was dressed in crimson, was exempt from taxation, and served without pay; these oxen were maintained at the public charge in a public hospital, and the white and red banner of the city was spread above the car between two lofty spars. Those taken at the battle of Monteaperto are still exhibited in Siena Cathedral as trophies of that fatal day.</p>
						<p>“Macchiavelli erroneously places the adoption of the Carroccio by the Florentines at this epoch, but it was long before in use, and probably was copied from the Milanese, as soon as Florence became strong and independent enough to equip a national army. Eribert, Archbishop of Milan, seems to have been its author, for in the war between Conrad <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> and that city, besides other arrangements for military, organization, he is said to have finished by the invention of the Carroccio: it was a pious and not impolitic imitation of the ark as it was carried before the Israelites. This vehicle is described, and also represented in ancient paintings, as a four-wheeled oblong car, drawn by two, four, or six bullocks: the car was always red, and the bullocks, even to their hoofs, covered as above described, but with red or white according to the faction; the ensign staff was red, lofty, and tapering, and surmounted by a cross or golden ball: on this, between two white fringed veils, hung the national standard, and halfway down the mast, a crucifix. A platform ran out in front of the car, spacious enough for a few chosen men to defend it, while behind, on a corresponding space, the musicians with their military instruments gave spirit to the combat: mass was said on the <em>Carroccio</em> ere it quitted the city, the surgeons were stationed near it, and not unfrequently a chaplain also attended it to the field. The loss of the <em>Carroccio</em> was a great disgrace, and betokened utter discomfiture; it was given to the most distinguished knight, who had a public salary and wore conspicuous armor and a golden belt: the best troops were stationed round it, and there was frequently the hottest of the fight.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“Besides the Carroccio, the Florentine army was accompanied by a great bell, called Martinella, or Campana degli Asini, which, for thirty days before hostilities began, tolled continually day and night from the arch of Porta Santa Maria, as a public declaration of war, and, as the ancient chronicle hath it, ‘for greatness of mind, that the enemy might have full time to prepare himself.’ At the same time also, the Carroccio was drawn from its place in the offices of San Giovanni by the most distinguished knights and noble vassals of the republic, and conducted in state to the Mercato Nuovo, where it was placed upon the circular stone still existing, and remained there until the army took the field. Then also the Martinella was removed from its station to a wooden tower placed on another car, and with the Carroccio served to guide the troops by night and day. ‘And with these two pomps, of the Carroccio and Campana,’ says Malespini, ‘the pride of the old citizens, our ancestors, was ruled.’ ”</p>

It was intended by thus dividing the supreme authority between two magistrates of different politics, that one should correct the other, and justice be equally administered; more especially as, in conjunction with the people, they were allowed to elect a deliberative council of thirty-six citizens, belonging to the principal trades without distinction of party.”</p>

					<p>Vanni Fucci, who calls himself a mule, was a bastard son of Fuccio de’ Lazzari. All the commentators paint him in the darkest colors. Dante had known him as “a man of blood and wrath,” and seems to wonder he is here, and not in the circle of the Violent, or of the Irascible. But his great crime was the robbery of a sacristy. Benvenuto da Imola relates the story in detail. He speaks of him as a man of depraved life, many of whose misdeeds went unpunished, because he was of noble family. Being banished from Pistoia for his crimes, he returned to the city one night of the Carnival, and was in company with eighteen other revellers, among whom was Vanni della Nona, a notary; when, not content with their insipid diversions, he stole away with two companions to the church of San Giacomo, and, finding its custodians absent, or asleep with feasting and drinking, he entered the sacristy and robbed it of all its precious jewels. These he secreted in the house of the notary, which was close at hand, thinking that on account of his honest repute no suspicion would fall upon him. A certain Rampino was arrested for the theft, and put to the torture; when Vanni Fucci, having escaped to Monte Carelli, beyond the Florentine jurisdiction, sent a messenger to Rampino’s father, confessing all the circumstances of the crime. Hereupon the notary was seized “on the first Monday in Lent, as he was going to a sermon in the church of the Minorite Friars,” and was hanged for the theft, and Rampino set at liberty.</p>

He smooths over Dante’s invectives by remarking that Dante “makes not too honorable mention of him in the Comedy”; and quotes a sonnet of his, which is pathetic from its utter despair and self-reproach:⁠—</p>

					<p>The disasters soon to befall Florence, and in which even the neighboring town of Prato would rejoice, to mention no others.

						<p>“Battles first began between the Cerchi and Giugni at their houses in the Via del Garbo; they fought day and night, and with the aid of the Cavalcanti and Antellesi the former subdued all that quarter: a thousand rural adherents strengthened their bands, and that day might have seen the Neri’s destruction if an unforseen disaster had not turned the scale. A certain dissolute priest, called Neri Abati, prior of San Piero Scheraggio, false to his family and in concert with the Black chiefs, consented to set fire to the dwellings of his own kinsmen in Orto-san-Michele; the flames, assisted by faction, spread rapidly over the richest and most crowded part of Florence: shops, warehouses, towers, private dwellings and palaces, from the old to the new marketplace, from <em>Vacchereccia</em> to <em>Porta Santa Maria</em> and the <em>Ponte Vecchio</em>, all was one broad sheet of fire: more than nineteen hundred houses were consumed; plunder and devastation revelled unchecked amongst the flames, whole races were reduced in one moment to beggary, and vast magazines of the richest merchandise were destroyed. The Cavalcanti, one of the most opulent families in Florence, beheld their whole property consumed, and lost all courage; they made no attempt to save it, and, after almost gaining possession of the city, were finally overcome by the opposite faction.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“From the time we entered the torrid zone, we were never wearied with admiring, every night, the beauty of the Southern sky, which, as we advanced toward the south, opened new constellations to our view. We feel an indescribable sensation, when, on approaching the equator, and particularly on passing from one hemisphere to the other, we see those stars, which we have contemplated from our infancy, progressively sink, and finally disappear. Nothing atvakens in the traveller a livelier remembrance of the immense distance by which he is separated from his country, than the aspect of an unknown firmament. The grouping of the stars of the first magnitude, some scattered nebula, rivalling in splendor the milky way, and tracks of space remarkable for their extreme blackness, give a particular physiognomy to the Southern sky. This sight fills with admiration even those who, uninstructed in the branches of accurate science, feel the same emotion of delight in the contemplation of the heavenly vault, as in the view of a beautiful landscape, or a majestic site. A traveller has no need of being a botanist, to recognize the torrid zone on the mere aspect of its vegetation; and without having acquired any notions of astronomy, without any acquaintance with the celestial charts of Flamstead and De la Caille, he feels he is not in Europe, when he sees the immense constellation of the Ship, or the phosphorescent clouds of Magellan, arise on the horizon.”</p>

						<p>“Dionysius records, that when Perillus desired to become an artificer of Phalaris, a cruel and tyrannical king who depopulated the kingdom, and was guilty of many dreadful excesses, he presented to him, already too well skilled in cruelty, a brazen bull, which he had just constructed. In one of its sides there was a secret door, by which those who were sentenced should enter and be burnt to death. The idea was, that the sounds produced by the agony of the sufferer confined within should resemble the roaring of a bull; and thus, while nothing human struck the ear, the mind should be unimpressed by a feeling of mercy. The king highly applauded the invention, and said, ‘Friend, the value of thy industry is yet untried: more cruel even than the people account me, thou thyself shalt be the first victim.’ ”</p>

					<p>This Papal war, which was waged against Christians, and not against pagan Saracens, nor unbelieving Jews, nor against the renegades who had helped them at the siege of Acre, or given them aid and comfort by traffic, is thus described by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Norton, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Travel and Study in Italy</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 263:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“This ‘war near the Lateran’ was a war with the great family of Colonna. Two of the house were Cardinals. They had been deceived in the election, and were rebellious under the rule of Boniface. The Cardinals of the great Ghibelline house took no pains to conceal their ill-will toward the Guelf Pope. Boniface, indeed, accused them of plotting with his enemies for his overthrow. The Colonnas, finding Rome unsafe, had withdrawn to their strong town of Palestrina, whence they could issue forth at will for plunder, and where they could give shelter to those who shared in their hostility toward the Pope. On the other hand, Boniface, not trusting himself in Rome, withdrew to the secure height of Orvieto, and thence, on the 14th of December, 1297, issued a terrible bull for a crusade against them, granting plenary indulgence to all, (such was the Christian temper of the times, and so literally were the violent seizing upon the kingdom of Heaven,) granting plenary indulgence to all who would take up arms against these rebellious sons of the Church and march against their chief stronghold, their ‘<i xml:lang="it">alto seggio</i>’ of Palestrina. They and their adherents had already been excommunicated and put under the ban of the Church; they had been stripped of all dignities and privileges; their property had been confiscated; and they were now by this bull placed in the position of enemies, not of the Pope alone, but of the Church Universal. Troops gathered against them from all quarters of Papal Italy. Their lands were ravaged, and they themselves shut up within their stronghold; but for a long time they held out in their ancient high-walled mountaintown. It was to gain Palestrina that Boniface ‘had war near the Lateran.’ The great church and palace of the Lateran, standing on the summit of the Ccelian Hill, close to the city wall, overlooks the Campagna, which, in broken levels of brown and green and purple fields, reaches to the base of the encircling mountains. Twenty miles away, crowning the top and clinging to the side of one of the last heights of the Sabine range, are the gray walls and roofs of Palestrina. It was a far more conspicuous place at the close of the thirteenth century than it is now; for the great columns of the famous temple of Fortune still rose above the town, and the ancient citadel kept watch over it from its high rock. At length, in September, 1298, the Colonnas, reduced to the hardest extremities, became ready for peace. Boniface promised largely. The two Cardinals presented themselves before him at Rieti, in coarse brown dresses, and with ropes around their necks, in token of their repentance and submission. The Pope gave them not only pardon and absolution, but hope of being restored to their titles and possessions. This was the ‘<i xml:lang="it">lunga promessa con l’ attender corto</i>’; for, while the Colonnas were retained near him, and these deceptive hopes held out to them, Boniface sent the Bishop of Orvieto to take possession of Palestrina, and to destroy it utterly, leaving only the church to stand as a monument above its ruins. The work was done thoroughly;⁠—a plough was drawn across the site of the unhappy town, and salt scattered in the furrow, that the land might thenceforth be desolate. The inhabitants were removed from the mountain to the plain, and there forced to build new homes for themselves, which, in their turn, two years afterwards, were thrown down and burned by order of the implacable Pope. This last piece of malignity was accomplished in 1300, the year of the Jubilee, the year in which Dante was in Rome, and in which he saw Guy of Montefeltro, the counsellor of Boniface in deceit, burning in Hell.”</p>

					<p>The story of Sylvester and Constantine is one of the legends of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Legenda Aurea</i>.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Sylvester was born at Rome of virtuous parents; and at a time when Constantine was still in the darkness of idolatry and persecuted the Christians, Sylvester, who had been elected Bishop of Rome, fled from the persecution, and dwelt for some time in a cavern, near the summit of Monte Calvo. While he lay there concealed, the Emperor was attacked by a horrible leprosy: and having called to him the priests of his false gods, they advised that he should bathe himself in a bath of children’s blood, and three thousand children were collected for this purpose. And as he proceeded in his chariot to the place where the bath was to be prepared, the mothers of these children threw themselves in his way with dishevelled hair, weeping, and crying aloud for mercy. Then Constantine was moved to tears, and he ordered his chariot to stop, and he said to his nobles and to his attendants who were around him, ‘Far better is it that I should die, than cause the death of these innocents!’ And then he commanded that the children should be restored to their mothers with great gifts, in recompense of what they had suffered; so they went away full of joy and gratitude, and the Emperor returned to his palace.</p>
						<p>“On that same night, as he lay asleep, <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter and <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul appeared at his bedside: and they stretched their hands over him and said, ‘Because thou hast feared to spill the innocent blood, Jesus Christ has sent us to bring thee good counsel. Send to Sylvester, who lies hidden among the mountains, and he shall show thee the pool in which, having washed three times, thou shalt be clean from thy leprosy; and henceforth thou shalt adore the God of the Christians, and thou shalt cease to persecute and to oppress them.’ Then Constantine, awaking from this vision, sent his soldiers in search of Sylvester. And when they took him, he supposed that it was to lead him to death; nevertheless he went cheerfully: and when he appeared before the Emperor, Constantine arose and saluted him, and said, ‘I would know of thee who are those two gods who appeared to me in the visions of the night?’ And Sylvester replied, ‘They were not gods, but the apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ.’ Then Constantine desired that he would show him the effigies of these two apostles; and Sylvester sent for two pictures of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter and <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul, which were in the possession of certain pious Christians. Constantine, having beheld them, saw that they were the same who had appeared to him in his dream. Then Sylvester baptized him, and he came out of the font cured of his malady.”</p>

Some, whom their wounds, being pinched by the morning cold, had roused from their posture, were put to death by the enemy, as they were rising up, all covered with blood, from the midst of the heaps of carcasses.

					<p>Fra Dolcino was one of the early social and religious reformers in the North of Italy. His sect bore the name of “Apostles,” and its chief, if not only, heresy was a desire to bring back the Church to the simplicity of the apostolic times. In 1305 he withdrew with his followers to the mountains overlooking the Val Sesia in Piedmont, where he was pursued and besieged by the Church party, and, after various fortunes of victory and defeat, being reduced by “stress of snow” and famine, was taken prisoner, together with his companion, the beautiful Margaret of Trent. Both were burned at Vercelli on the 1st of June, 1307. This “last act of the tragedy” is thus described by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Mariotti, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Historical Memoir of Fra Dolcino and His Times</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 290:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Margaret of Trent enjoyed the precedence due to her sex. She was first led out into a spot near Vercelli, bearing the name of ‘Arena Servi,’ or more properly ‘Arena Cervi,’ in the sands, that is, of the torrent Cervo, which has its confluent with the Sesia at about one mile above the city. A high stake had been erected in a conspicuous part of the place. To this she was fastened, and a pile of wood was reared at her feet. The eyes of the inhabitants of town and country were upon her. On her also were the eyes of Dolcino. She was burnt alive with slow fire.</p>
						<p>“Next came the turn of Dolcino: he was seated high on a car drawn by oxen, and thus paraded from street to street all over Vercelli. His tormentors were all around him. Beside the car, iron pots were carried, filled with burning charcoals; deep in the charcoals were iron pincers, glowing at white heat. These pincers were continually applied to the various parts of Dolcino’s naked body, all along his progress, till all his flesh was torn piecemeal from his limbs: when every bone was bare and the whole town was perambulated, they drove the still living carcass back to the same arena, and threw it on the burning mass in which Margaret had been consumed.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Farther on he adds:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Divested of all fables which ignorance, prejudice, or open calumny involved it in, Dolcino’s scheme amounted to nothing more than a reformation, not of religion, but of the Church; his aim was merely the destruction of the temporal power of the clergy, and he died for his country no less than for his God. The wealth, arrogance, and corruption of the Papal See appeared to him, as it appeared to Dante, as it appeared to a thousand other patriots before and after him, an eternal hindrance to the union, peace, and welfare of Italy, as it was a perpetual check upon the progress of the human race, and a source of infinite scandal to the piety of earnest believers.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“To this clear mission of Italian protestantism Dolcino was true throughout. If we bring the light of even the clumsiest criticism to bear on his creed, even such as it has been summed up by the ignorance or malignity of men who never utter his name without an imprecation, we have reason to be astonished at the little we find in it that may be construed into a wilful deviation frum the strictest orthodoxy. Luther and Calvin would equally have repudiated him. He was neither a Presbyterian nor an Episcopalian, but an uncompromising, stanch Papist. His was, most eminently, the heresy of those whom we have designated as ‘literal Christians.’ He would have the Gospel strictly⁠—perhaps blindly⁠—adhered to. Neither was that, in the abstract, an unpardonable offence in the eyes of the Romanism of those times⁠—witness <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis and his early flock⁠—provided he had limited himself to make Gospel-law binding upon himself and his followers only. But Dolcino must needs enforce it upon the whole Christian community, enforce it especially on those who set up as teachers of the Gospel, on those who laid claim to Apostolical succession. That was the error that damned him.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of Margaret he still farther says, referring to some old manuscript as authority:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“She was known by the emphatic appellation of Margaret the Beautiful. It is added, that she was an orphan, heiress of noble parents, and had been placed for her education in a monastery of <abbr>St.</abbr> Catherine in Trent; that there Dolcino⁠—who had also been a monk, or at least a novice, in a convent of the Order of the Humiliati, in the same town, and had been expelled in consequence either of his heretic tenets, or of immoral conduct⁠—succeeded nevertheless in becoming domesticated in the nunnery of <abbr>St.</abbr> Catherine, as a steward or agent to the nuns, and there accomplished the fascination and abduction of the wealthy heiress.”</p>

					<p>“Bertrand de Born,” says the old Provençal biography, published by Raynouard, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Choix de Poésies Originales des Troubadours</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 76, “was a chatelain of the bishopric of Perigueux, Viscount of Hautefort, a castle with nearly a thousand retainers. He had a brother, and would have dispossessed him of his inheritance, had it not been for the king of England. He was always at war with all his neighbors, with the Count of Perigueux, and with the Viscount of Limoges, and with his brother Constantine, and with Richard, when he was Count of Poitou. He was a good cavalier, and a good warrior, and a good lover, and a good troubadour; and well informed and well spoken; and knew well how to bear good and evil fortune. Whenever he wished, he was master of King Henry of England and of his son; but always desired that father and son should be at war with each other, and one brother with the other. And he always wished that the king of France and the king of England should be at variance; and if there were either peace or truce, straightway he sought and endeavored by his satires to undo the peace, and to show how each was dishonored by it. And he had great advantages and great misfortunes by thus exciting feuds between them. He wrote many satires, but only two songs. The king of Aragon called the songs of Giraud de Borneil the wives of Bertrand de Born’s satires. And he who sang for him bore the name of Papiol. And he was handsome and courteous; and called the Count of Britany, Rassa; and the king of England, Yes and No; and his son, the young king, Marinier. And he set his whole heart on fomenting war; and embroiled the father and son of England, until the young king was killed by an arrow in a castle of Bertrand de Born.</p>
					<p>“And Bertrand used to boast that he had more wits than he needed. And when the king took him prisoner, he asked him, ‘Have you all your wits, for you will need them now?’ And he answered, ‘I lost them all when the young king died.’ Then the king wept, and pardoned him, and gave him robes, and lands, and honors. And he lived long and became a Cistercian monk.”</p>
					<p>Fauriel, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Poésie Provençale</i>, Adler’s <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 483, quoting part of this passage, adds:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In this notice the old biographer indicates the dominant trait of Bertrand’s character very distinctly; it was an unbridled passion for war. He loved it not only as the occasion for exhibiting proofs of valor, for acquiring power, and for winning glory, but also, and even more on account of its hazards, on account of the exaltation of courage and of life which it produced, nay, even for the sake of the tumult, the disorders, and the evils which are accustomed to follow in its train. Bertrand de Born is the ideal of the undisciplined and adventuresome warrior of the Middle Age, rather than that of the chevalier in the proper sense of the term.”</p>

					<p>Bertrand de Born, if not the best of the Troubadours, is the most prominent and striking character among them. His life is a drama full of romantic interest; beginning with the old castle in Gascony, “the dames, the cavaliers, the arms, the loves, the courtesy, the bold emprise”; and ending in a Cistercian convent, among friars and fastings and penitence and prayers. <a href="inferno.xhtml#noteref-432" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> of England had four sons, all of whom were more or less rebellious against him. They were, Henry, surnamed Curt-Mantle, and called by the Troubadours and novelists of his time “The Young King,” because he was crowned during his father’s life; Richard Coeur-de-Lion, Count of Guienne and Poitou; Geoffroy, Duke of Brittany; and John Lackland. Henry was the only one of these who bore the title of king at the time in question. Bertrand de Born was on terms of intimacy with him, and speaks of him in his poems as <i xml:lang="it">lo Reys joves</i>, sometimes lauding, and sometimes reproving him. One of the best of these poems is his <em>Complainte</em>, on the death of Henry, which took place in 1183, from disease, say some accounts, from the bolt of a crossbow say others. He complains that he has lost “the best king that was ever born of mother”; and goes on to say, “King of the courteous, and emperor of the valiant, you would have been Seigneur if you had lived longer; for you bore the name of the Young King, and were the chief and peer of youth. Ay! hauberk and sword, and beautiful buckler, helmet and gonfalon, and purpoint and sark, and joy and love, there is none to maintain them!” See Raynouard, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Choix de Poésies</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 49.</p>

					<p>The persons here mentioned gain a kind of immortality from Dante’s verse. The Stricca, or Baldastricca, was a lawyer of Siena; and Niccolò dei Salimbeni, or Bonsignori, introduced the fashion of stuffing pheasants with cloves, or, as Benvenuto says, of roasting them at a fire of cloves. Though Dante mentions them apart, they seem, like the two others named afterwards, to have been members of the <i xml:lang="it">Brigtita Spendereccia</i>, or Prodigal Club, of Siena, whose extravagances are recorded by Benvenuto da Imola. This club consisted of “twelve very rich young gentlemen, who took it into their heads to do things that would make a great part of the world wonder.” Accordingly each contributed eighteen thousand golden florins to a common fund, amounting in all to two hundred and sixteen thousand florins. They built a palace, in which each member had a splendid chamber, and they gave sumptuous dinners and suppers; ending their banquets sometimes by throwing all the dishes, table-ornaments, and knives of gold and silver out of the window. “This silly institution,” continues Benvenuto, “lasted only ten months, the treasury being exhausted, and the wretched members became the fable and laughingstock of all the world.”</p>
					<p>In honor of this club, Folgore da San Geminiano, a clever poet of the day (1260), wrote a series of twelve convivial sonnets, one for each month of the year, with Dedication and Conclusion.

The sound reached the king’s ears, who lay encamped in the valley still called by his name, about eight miles from Ronceval, towards Gascony, being carried so far by supernatural power. Charles would have flown to his succor, but was prevented by Ganalon, who, conscious of Orlando’s sufferings, insinuated it was usual with him to sound his horn on light occasions. ‘He is, perhaps,’ said he, ‘pursuing some wild beast, and the sound echoes through the woods; it will be fruitless, therefore, to seek him.’ O wicked traitor, deceitful as Judas!

					<p>Count Ugolino della Gherardesca was Podestà of Pisa. “Raised to the highest offices of the republic for ten years,” says Napier, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Florentine History</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 318, “he would soon have become absolute, had not his own nephew, Nino Visconte, Judge of Gallura, contested this supremacy and forced himself into conjoint and equal authority; this could not continue, and a sort of compromise was for the moment effected, by which Visconte retired to the absolute government of Sardinia. But Ugolino, still dissatisfied, sent his son to disturb the island; a deadly feud was the consequence, Guelph against Guelph, while the latent spirit of Ghibellinism, which filled the breasts of the citizens and was encouraged by priest and friar, felt its advantage; the Archbishop Ruggiero Rubaldino was its real head, but he worked with hidden caution as the apparent friend of either chieftain. In 1287, after some sharp contests, both of them abdicated, for the sake, as it was alleged, of public tranquillity; but, soon perceiving their error, again united, and, scouring the streets with all their followers, forcibly reestablished their authority. Ruggieri seemed to assent quietly to this new outrage, even looked without emotion on the bloody corpse of his favorite nephew, who had been stabbed by Ugolino; and so deep was his dissimulation, that he not only refused to believe the murdered body to be his kinsman’s, but zealously assisted the Count to establish himself alone in the government, and accomplish Visconte’s ruin. The design was successful; Nino was overcome and driven from the town, and in 1288 Ugolino entered Pisa in triumph from his villa, where he had retired to await the catastrophe. The Archbishop had neglected nothing, and Ugolino found himself associated with this prelate in the public government; events now began to thicken; the Count could not brook a competitor, much less a Ghibelline priest: in the month of July both parties flew to arms, and the Archbishop was victorious. After a feeble attempt to rally in the public palace. Count Ugolino, his two sons, Uguccione and Gaddo, and two young grandsons, Anselmuccio and Brigata, surrendered at discretion, and were immediately imprisoned in a tower, afterwards called the <i xml:lang="it">Torre della fame</i>, and there perished by starvation. Count Ugolino della Gherardesca, whose tragic story after five hundred years still sounds in awful numbers from the lyre of Dante, was stained with the ambition and darker vices of the age; like other potent chiefs, he sought to enslave his country, and checked at nothing in his impetuous career; he was accused of many crimes; of poisoning his own nephew, of failing in war, making a disgraceful peace, of flying shamefully, perhaps traitorously, at Meloria, and of obstructing all negotiations with Genoa for the return of his imprisoned countrymen. Like most others of his rank in those frenzied times he belonged more to faction than his country, and made the former subservient to his own ambition; but all these accusations, even if well founded, would not draw him from the general standard; they would only prove that he shared the ambition, the cruelty, the ferocity, the recklessness of human life and suffering, and the relentless pursuit of power in common with other chieftains of his age and country. Ugolino was overcome, and suffered a cruel death; his family was dispersed, and his memory has perhaps been blackened with a darker coloring to excuse the severity of his punishment; but his sons, who naturally followed their parent’s fortune, were scarcely implicated in his crimes, although they shared his fate; and his grandsons, though not children, were still less guilty, though one of these was not unstained with blood. The Archbishop had public and private wrongs to revenge, and had he fallen, his sacred character alone would probably have procured for him a milder destiny.”</p>
					<p>Villani, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> 128, gives this account of the imprisonment:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Pisans, who had imprisoned Count Ugolino and his two sons and two grandsons, children of Count Guelfo, as we have before mentioned, in a tower on the Piazza degli Anziani, ordered the door of the tower to be locked, and the keys to be thrown into the Arno, and forbade any food should be given to the prisoners, who in a few days died of hunger. And the five dead bodies, being taken together out of the tower, were ignominiously buried; and from that day forth the tower was called the Tower of Famine, and shall be forever more. For this cruelty the Pisans were much blamed through all the world where it was known; not so much for the Count’s sake, as on account of his crimes and treasons he perhaps deserved such a death, but for the sake of his children and grandchildren, who were young and innocent boys; and this sin, committed by the Pisans, did not remain unpunished.”</p>

						<p>“This imagination may appear grotesque and forced if one looks at the map, for the isle of Gorgona is at some distance from the mouth of the Arno, and I had always thought so, until the day when, having ascended the tower of Pisa, I was struck with the aspect which the Gorgona presented from that point. It seemed to shut up the Arno. I then understood how Dante might naturally have had this idea, which had seemed strange to me, and his imagination was justified in my eyes. He had not seen the Gorgona from the Leaning Tower, which did not exist in his time, but from some one of the numerous towers which protected the ramparts of Pisa. This fact alone would be sufficient to show what an excellent interpretation of a poet travelling is.”</p>

Many of the gravest Fathers of the first five centuries naturally conceived and taught⁠—as is indeed intrinsically reasonable⁠—that after death some souls will be punished for their sins until they are cleansed, and then will be released from pain. The Manichaeans imagined that all souls, before returning to their native heaven, must be borne first to the moon, where with good waters they would be washed pure from outward filth, and then to the sun, where they would be purged by good fires from every inward stain. After these lunar and solar lustrations, they were fit for the eternal world of light. But the conception of Purgatory as it was held by the early Christians, whether orthodox Fathers or heretical sects, was merely the just and necessary result of applying to the subject of future punishment the two ethical ideas that punishment should partake of degrees proportioned to guilt, and that it should be restorative.⁠ ⁠…</p>

The doctrine as matured and promulgated by Gregory, giving to the representatives of the Church an almost unlimited power over Purgatory, rapidly grew into favor with the clergy, and sank with general conviction into the hopes and fears of the laity,” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-531" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The pleasure we felt on discovering the Southern Cross was warmly shared by such of the crew as had lived in the colonies. In the solitude of the seas, we hail a star as a friend from whom we have long been separated. Among the Portuguese and the Spaniards peculiar motives seem to increase this feeling; a religious sentiment attaches them to a constellation, the form of which recalls the sign of the faith planted by their ancestors in the deserts of the New World.</p>
						<p>“The two great stars which mark the summit and the foot of the Cross having nearly the same right ascension, it follows hence, that the constellation is almost perpendicular at the moment when it passes the meridian. This circumstance is known to every nation that lives beyond the tropics, or in the Southern hemisphere. It has been observed at what hour of the night, in different seasons, the Cross o’ the South is erect or inclined. It is a timepiece that advances very regularly near four minutes a day, and no other group of stars exhibits, to the naked eye, an observation of time so easily made. How often have we heard our guides exclaim in the savannahs of Venezuela, or in the desert extending from Lima to Truxillo, ‘Midnight is past, the Cross begins to bend!’ How often those words reminded us of that affecting scene, where Paul and Virginia, seated near the source of the river of Lataniers, conversed together for the last time, and where the old man, at the sight of the Southern Cross, warns them that it is time to separate.”</p>

					<p>Cato of Utica. “Pythagoras escapes, in the fabulous hell of Dante,” says Sir Thomas Brown, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Urn Burial</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, “among that swarm of philosophers, wherein, whilst we meet with Plato and Socrates, Cato is found in no lower place than Purgatory.”</p>
					<p>In the description of the shield of Aeneas, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Aeneid</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span>, Cato is represented as presiding over the good in the Tartarean realms: “And the good apart, Cato dispensing laws to them.” This line of Virgil may have suggested to Dante the idea of making Cato the warden of Purgatory.</p>
					<p>In the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 28, he expresses the greatest reverence for him. Marcia returning to him in her widowhood, he says, “symbolizes the noble soul returning to God in old age.” And continues: “What man on earth was more worthy to symbolize God, than Cato? Surely none”;⁠—ending the chapter with these words: “In his name it is beautiful to close what I have had to say of the signs of nobility, because in him this nobility displays them all through all ages.”</p>
					<p>Here, on the shores of Purgatory, his countenance is adorned with the light of the four stars which are the four virtues. Justice, Prudence, Fortitude, and Temperance, and it is foretold of him, that his garments will shine brightly on the last day. And here he is the symbol of Liberty, since, for her sake, to him “not bitter was death in Utica”; and the meaning of Purgatory is spiritual Liberty, or freedom from sin through purification, “the glorious liberty of the children of God.” Therefore in thus selecting the “Divine Cato” for the guardian of this realm, Dante shows himself to have greater freedom than the critics, who accuse him of “a perverse theology in saving the soul of an idolater and suicide.” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-540" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Upon this speech of Virgil to Cato, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Barlow, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Study of Dante</i>, remarks:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The eighth book of the Tesoro of Brunetto Latini is headed, <i xml:lang="it">Qui comincia la Rettorica che c’ insegna a ben parlare, e di governare città e popoli</i>. In this art Dante was duly instructed by his loving master, and became the most able orator of his era in Italy. Giov. Villani speaks of him as <i xml:lang="it">retorico perfetto tanto in dittare e versificare come in aringhiera parlare</i>. But without this record and without acquaintance with the poet’s political history, knowing nothing of his influence in debates and councils, nor of his credit at foreign courts, we might, from the occasional speeches in the Divina Commedia, be fully assured of the truth of what Villani has said, and that Dante’s words and manner were always skilfully adapted to the purpose he had in view, and to the persons whom he addressed.</p>
						<p>“Virgil’s speech to the venerable Cato is a perfect specimen of persuasive eloquence. The sense of personal dignity is here combined with extreme courtesy and respect, and the most flattering appeals to the old man’s wellknown sentiments, his love of liberty, his love of rectitude, and his devoted attachment to Marcia, are interwoven with irresistible art; but though the resentment of Cato at the approach of the strangers is thus appeased, and he is persuaded to regard them with as much favor as the severity of his character permits, yet he will not have them think that his consent to their proceeding has been obtained by adulation, but simply by the assertion of power vouchsafed to them from on high⁠—</p>

					<p>A symbol of humility. Ruskin, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Modern Painters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 232, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“There is a still deeper significance in the passage quoted, a little while ago, from Homer, describing Ulysses casting himself down on the <em>rushes</em> and the corngiving land at the river shore⁠—the rushes and corn being to him only good for rest and sustenance⁠—when we compare it with that in which Dante tells us he was ordered to descend to the shore of the lake as he entered Purgatory, to gather a <em>rush</em>, and gird himself with it, it being to him the emblem not only of rest, but of humility under chastisement, the rush (or reed) being the only plant which can grow there;⁠—‘no plant which bears leaves, or hardens its bark, can live on that shore, because it does not yield to the chastisement of its waves.’ It cannot but strike the reader singularly how deep and harmonious a significance runs through all these words of Dante⁠—how every syllable of them, the more we penetrate it, becomes a seed of farther thought! For follow up this image of the girding with the reed, under trial, and see to whose feet it will lead us. As the grass of the earth, thought of as the herb yielding seed, leads us to the place where our Lord commanded the multitude to sit down by companies upon the green grass; so the grass of the waters, thought of as sustaining itself among the waters of affliction, leads us to the place where a stem of it was put into our Lord’s hand for his sceptre; and in the crown of thorns, and the rod of reed, was foreshown the everlasting truth of the Christian ages⁠—that all glory was to be begun in suffering, and all power in humility.”</p>

						<p>“There is only one more point to be noticed in the Dantesque landscape; namely, the feeling entertained by the poet towards the sky. And the love of mountains is so closely connected with the love of clouds, the sublimity of both depending much on their association, that, having found Dante regardless of the Carrara mountains as seen from San Miniato, we may well expect to find him equally regardless of the clouds in which the sun sank behind them. Accordingly, we find that his only pleasure in the sky depends on its ‘white clearness,’⁠—that turning into <i xml:lang="it">bianco aspetto di celestro</i>, which is so peculiarly characteristic of fine days in Italy. His pieces of pure pale light are always exquisite. In the dawn on the purgatorial mountain, first, in its pale white, he sees the <i xml:lang="it">tremolar della marina</i>⁠—trembling of the sea; then it becomes vermilion; and at last, near sunrise, orange. These are precisely the changes of a calm and perfect dawn. The scenery of Paradise begins with ‘day added to day,’ the light of the sun so flooding the heavens, that ‘never rain nor river made lake so wide’; and throughout the Paradise all the beauty depends on spheres of light, or stars, never on clouds. But the pit of the Inferno is at first sight obscure, deep, and so <em>cloudy</em> that at its bottom nothing could be seen. When Dante and Virgil reach the marsh in which the souls of those who have been angry and sad in their lives are forever plunged, they find it covered with thick fog; and the condemned souls say to them,</p>
						<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">

During the year (no doubt the calculations were loose and vague) the city was visited by millions of pilgrims. At one time, so vast was the press both within and without the walls, that openings were broken for ingress and egress. Many people were trampled down, and perished by suffocation.⁠ ⁠… Lodgings were exorbitantly dear, forage scarce; but the ordinary food of man, bread, meat, wine, and fish, was sold in great plenty and at moderate prices. The oblations were beyond calculation. It is reported by an eyewitness that two priests stood with rakes in their hands sweeping the uncounted gold and silver from the altars. Nor was this tribute, like offerings or subsidies for Crusades, to be devoted to special uses, the accoutrements, provisions, freight of armies. It was entirely at the free and irresponsible disposal of the Pope. Christendom of its own accord was heaping at the Pope’s feet this extraordinary custom; and receiving back the gift of pardon and everlasting life.”</p>

We set out, therefore, in the morning early, and as we were walking upon the seashore, and a kindly breeze fanned and refreshed our limbs, and the yielding sand softly submitted to our feet and made it delicious travelling, Cascilius on a sudden espied the statue of Serapis, and, according to the vulgar mode of superstition, raised his hand to his mouth, and paid his adoration in kisses. Upon which Octavius, addressing himself to me, said: ‘It is not well done, my brother Marcus, thus to leave your inseparable companion in the depth of Vulgar darkness, and to suffer him, in so clear a day, to stumble upon stones; stones, indeed, of figure, and anointed with oil, and crowned; but stones, however, still they are;⁠—for you cannot but be sensible that your permitting so foul an error in your friend redounds no less to your disgrace than his.’ This discourse of his held us through half the city; and now we began to find ourselves upon the free and open shore. There the gently washing waves had spread the extremest sands into the order of an artificial walk; and as the sea always expresses some roughness in his looks, even when the winds are still, although he did not roll in foam and angry surges to the shore, yet were we much delighted, as we walked upon the edges of the water, to see the crisping, frizzly waves glide in snaky folds, one while playing against our feet, and then again retiring and lost in the devouring ocean. Softly, then, and calmly as the sea about us, we travelled on, and kept upon the brim of the gently declining shore, beguiling the way with our stories.”</p>

Donatus places it at the right distance from Naples, but on the wrong side of the city; and even there he omits the grotto of Posilipo, which not being so deep in his time as the two last excavations have left it, must have opened precisely at his tomb. Donatus, too, gives, for Virgil’s own composition, an epitaph on the cliff now rejected as a forgery. And who is this Donatus?⁠—an obscure grammarian, or rather his counterfeit. The structure itself resembles a ruined pigeon-house, where the numerous <em>columbaria</em> would indicate a family-sepulchre: but who should repose in the tomb of Virgil, but Virgil alone? Visitors of every nation, kings and princes, have scratched their names on the stucco of this apocryphal ruin, but the poet’s awful name seems to have deterred them from versifying here.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Var forms the geographical boundary between France and Italy; but it is not till Nice is left behind, and the first height of the Riviera is surmounted, that the real Italy begins. Here the hills close round at the north, and suddenly, as the road turns at the top of a long ascent, the Mediterranean appears far below, washing the feet of the mountains that form the coast, and stretching away to the Southern horizon. The line of the shore is of extraordinary beauty. Here an abrupt cliff rises from the sea; here bold and broken masses of rock jut out into it; here the hills, their gray sides terraced for vineyards, slope gently down to the water’s edge; here they stretch into little promontories covered with orange and olive-trees.</p>
						<p>“One of the first of these promontories is that of Capo Sant’ Ospizio. A close grove of olives half conceals the old castle on its extreme point. With the afternoon sun full upon it, the trees palely glimmering as their leaves move in the light air, the sea so blue and smooth as to be like a darker sky, and not even a ripple upon the beach, it seems as if this were the very home of summer and of repose. It is remote and secluded from the stir and noise of the world. No road is seen leading to it, and one looks down upon the solitary castle and wonders what stories of enchantment and romance belong to a ruin that appears as if made for their dwelling-place. It is a scene out of that Italy which is the home of the imagination, and which becomes the Italy of memory.</p>
						<p>“As the road winds down to the sea, it passes under a high isolated peak, on which stands Esa, built as a city of refuge against pirates and Moors. A little farther on,</p>

					<p>Manfredi, king of Apulia and Sicily, was a natural son of the Emperor Frederick the Second. He was slain at the battle of Benevento, in 1265; one of the great and decisive battles of the Guelphs and Ghibellines, the Guelph or Papal forces being commanded by Charles of Anjou, and the Ghibellines or Imperialists by Manfredi.</p>
					<p>Malispini, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Storia</i>, <abbr>ch.</abbr> 187, thus describes his death and burial:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Manfredi, being left with few followers, behaved like a valiant gentleman who preferred to die in battle rather than to escape with shame. And putting on his helmet, which had on it a silver eagle for a crest, this eagle fell on the saddlebow before him; and seeing this he was greatly disturbed, and said in Latin to the barons who were near him, ‘<i xml:lang="la">Hoc est signum Dei</i>; for this crest I fastened on with my own hands in such a way that it could not fall.’ But he was not discouraged, and took heart, and went into battle like any other baron, without the royal insignia, in order not to be recognized. But short while it lasted, for his forces were already in flight; and they were routed and Manfredi slain in the middle of the enemy; and they were driven into the town by the soldiers of King Charles, for it was now night, and they lost the city of Benevento. And many of Manfredi’s barons were made prisoners, among whom were the Count Giordano, Messer Piero Asino degli Uberti, and many others, whom King Charles sent captive into Provence, and there had them put to death in prison; and he imprisoned many other Germans in different parts of the kingdom. And a few days afterwards the wife of Manfredi and his children and his sister, who were in Nocera de’ Sardini in Apulia, were taken prisoners by Charles; these died in prison. And for more than three days they made search after Manfredi; for he could not be found, nor was it known if he were dead, or a prisoner, or had escaped; because he had not worn his royal robes in the battle. And afterwards he was recognized by one of his own camp-followers, from certain marks upon his person, in the middle of the battlefield; and he threw him across an ass, and came shouting, ‘Who will buy Manfredi?’ for which a baron of the king beat him with a cane. And the body of Manfredi being brought to King Charles, he assembled all the barons who were prisoners, and asked each one if that was Manfredi; and timidly they answered yes. Count Giordano smote himself in the face with his hands, weeping and crying, ‘O my lord!’ whereupon he was much commended by the French, and certain Bretons besought that he might have honorable burial. Answered the king and said, ‘I would do it willingly, if he were not excommunicated’; and on that account he would not have him laid in consecrated ground, but he was buried at the foot of the bridge of Benevento, and each one of the army threw a stone upon his grave, so that a great pile was made. But afterwards, it is said, by command of the Pope, the Bishop of Cosenza took him from that grave, and sent him out of the kingdom, because it was Church land. And he was buried by the river Verde, at the confines of the kingdom and the Campagna. This battle was on a Friday, the last day of February, in the year one thousand two hundred and sixty-five.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Villani, who in his account of the battle copies Malispini almost literally, gives in another chapter, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 46, the following portrait of Manfredi; but it must be remembered that Villani was a Guelph, and Manfredi a Ghibelline:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“King Manfredi had for his mother a beautiful lady of the family of the Marquises of Lancia in Lombardy, with whom the Emperor had an intrigue, and was beautiful in person, and like his father and more than his father was given to dissipation of all kinds. He was a musician and singer, delighted in the company of buffoons and courtiers and beautiful concubines, and was always clad in green; he was generous and courteous, and of good demeanor, so that he was much beloved and gracious; but his life was wholly epicurean, hardly caring for God or the saints, but for the delights of the body. He was an enemy of holy Church, and of priests and monks, confiscating churches as his father had done; and a wealthy gentleman was he, both from the treasure which he inherited from the Emperor, and from King Conrad, his brother, and from his own kingdom, which was ample and fruitful, and which, so long as he lived, notwithstanding all the wars he had with the Church, he kept in good condition, so that it rose greatly in wealth and power, both by sea and by land.”</p>

						<p>“In this plain of Campaldino, now so pleasant and covered with vineyards, took place, on the 11th of June, 1289, a rude combat between the Guelphs of Florence and the <i xml:lang="it">fuorusciti</i> Ghibellines, aided by the Aretines. Dante fought in the front rank of the Florentine cavalry; for it must needs be that this man, whose life was so complete, should have been a soldier, before being a theologian, diplomatist, and poet. He was then twenty-four years of age. He himself described this battle in a letter, of which only a few lines remain. ‘At the battle of Campaldino,’ he says, ‘the Ghibelline party was routed and almost wholly slain. I was there, a novice in arms; I had great fear, and at last great joy, on account of the divers chances of the fight.’ One must not see in this phrase the confession of cowardice, which could have no place in a soul tempered like that of Alighieri. The only fear he had was lest the battle should be lost. In fact, the Florentines at first seemed beaten; their infantry fell back before the Aretine cavalry; but this first advantage of the enemy was its destruction, by dividing its forces. These were the vicissitudes of the battle to which Dante alludes, and which at first excited his fears, and then caused his joy.”</p>

With this horrible institute the climate conspires in severity, and selects from society the best constitutions. The sickly novice is cut off in one or two winters, the rest are subject to dropsy, and few arrive at old age.”</p>

						<p>“Who was this unhappy and perhaps guilty woman? The commentators say that she was of the family of Tolomei, illustrious at Siena. Among the different versions of her story there is one truly terrible. The outraged husband led his wife to an isolated castle in the Maremma of Siena, and there shut himself up with his victim, waiting his vengeance from the poisoned atmosphere of this solitude. Breathing with her the air which was killing her, he saw her slowly perish. This funeral tête-à-tête found him always impassive, until, according to the expression of Dante, the Maremma had unmade what he had once loved. This melancholy story might well have no other foundation than the enigma of Dante’s lines, and the terror with which this enigma may have struck the imaginations of his contemporaries.</p>

						<p>“Shakespeare unfolds the character of his persons, and presents them under all the variety of forms which they can naturally assume. He surrounds them with all the splendor of his imagination, and bestows on them that full and minute reality which his creative genius could alone confer. Of all tragic poets, he most amply develops character. On the other hand, Dante, if compared not only to Virgil, the most sober of poets, but even to Tacitus, will be found never to employ more than a stroke or two of his pencil, which he aims at imprinting almost insensibly on the hearts of his readers. Virgil has related the story of Eurydice in two hundred verses; Dante, in sixty verses, has finished his masterpiece⁠—the tale of Francesca da Rimini. The history of Desdemona has a parallel in the following passage of Dante. Nello della Pietra had espoused a lady of noble family at Sienna, named Madonna Pia. Her beauty was the admiration of Tuscany, and excited in the heart of her husband a jealousy, which, exasperated by false reports and groundless suspicions, at length drove him to the desperate resolution of Othello. It is difficult to decide whether the lady was quite innocent; but so Dante represents her. Her husband brought her into the Maremma, which, then as now, was a district destructive to health. He never told his unfortunate wife the reason of her banishment to so dangerous a country. He did not deign to utter complaint or accusation. He lived with her alone, in cold silence, without answering her questions, or listening to her remonstrances. He patiently waited till the pestilential air should destroy the health of this young lady. In a few months she died. Some chroniclers, indeed, tell us, that Nello used the dagger to hasten her death. It is certain that he survived her, plunged in sadness and perpetual silence. Dante had, in this incident, all the materials of an ample and very poetical narrative. But he bestows on it only four verses.”</p>

					<p>This terrible Ghino di Tacco was a nobleman of Asinalunga in the territory of Siena; one of those splendid fellows, who, from some real or imaginary wrong done them, take to the mountains and highways to avenge themselves on society. He is the true type of the traditionary stage bandit, the magnanimous melodramatic hero, who utters such noble sentiments and commits such atrocious deeds.</p>
					<p>Benvenuto is evidently dazzled and fascinated by him, and has to throw two Romans into the scale to do him justice. His account is as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Reader, I would have thee know that Ghino was not, as some write, so infamous as to be a great assassin and highway robber. For this Ghino di Tacco was a wonderful man, tall, muscular, black-haired, and strong; as agile as Scsvola, as prudent and liberal as Papirius Cursor. He was of the nobles of La Fratta, in the county of Siena; who, being forcibly banished by the Counts of Santafiore, held the noble castle of Radicofani against the Pope. With his marauders he made many and great prizes, so that no one could go safely to Rome or elsewhere through those regions. Yet hardly any one fell into his hands, who did not go away contented, and love and praise him.⁠ ⁠… If a merchant were taken prisoner, Ghino asked him kindly how much he was able to give him; and if he said five hundred pieces of gold, he kept three hundred for himself, and gave back two hundred, saying, ‘I wish you to go on with your business and to thrive.’ If it were a rich and fat priest, he kept his handsome mule, and gave him a wretched horse. And if it were a poor scholar, going to study, he gave him some money, and exhorted him to good conduct and proficiency in learning.”</p>

					<p>Boccaccio, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decameron</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> 2, relates the following adventure of Ghino di Tacco and the Abbot of Cligni:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Ghino di Tacco was a man famous for his bold and insolent robberies, who being banished trom Siena, and at utter enmity with the Counts di Santa Fiore, caused the town of Radicofani to rebel against the Church, and lived there whilst his gang robbed all who passed that way. Now when Boniface the Eighth was Pope, there came to court the Abbot of Cligni, reputed to be one of the richest prelates in the world, and having debauched his stomach with high living, he was advised by his physicians to go to the baths of Siena, as a certain cure. And, having leave from the Pope, he set out with a goodly train of coaches, carriages, horses, and servants, paying no respect to the rumors concerning this robber. Ghino was apprised of his coming, and took his measures accordingly; when, without the loss of a man, he enclosed the Abbot and his whole retinue in a narrow defile, where it was impossible for them to escape. This being done, he sent one of his principal fellows to the Abbot with his service, requesting the favor of him to alight and visit him at his castle. Upon which the Abbot replied, with a great deal of passion, that he had nothing to do with Ghino, but that his resolution was to go on, and he would see who dared to stop him. ‘My Lord,’ quoth the man, with a great deal of humility, ‘you are now in a place where all excommunications are kicked out of doors; then please to oblige my master in this thing; it will be your best way.’ Whilst they were talking together, the place was surrounded with highwaymen, and the Abbot, seeing himselt a prisoner, went with a great deal of ill will with the fellow to the castle, followed by his whole retinue, where he dismounted, and was lodged, by Ghino’s appointment, in a poor, dark little room, whilst every other person was well accommodated according to his respective station, and the carriages and all the horses taken exact care of. This being done, Ghino went to the Abbot, and said, ‘My Lord, Ghino, whose guest you are, requests the favor of you to let him know whither you are going, and upon what account?’ The Abbot was wise enough to lay all his haughtiness aside for the present, and satisfied him with regard to both. Ghino went away at hearing this, and, resolving to cure him without a bath, he ordered a great fire to be kept constantly in his room, coming to him no more till next morning, when he brought him two slices of toasted bread, in a fine napkin, and a large glass of his own rich white wine, saying to him, ‘My Lord, when Ghino was young, he studied physic, and he declares that the very best medicine for a pain in the stomach is what he has now provided for you, of which these things are to be the beginning. Then take them, and have a good heart.’ The Abbot, whose hunger was much greater than was his will to joke, ate the bread, though with a great deal of indignation, and drank the glass of wine; after which he began to talk a little arrogantly, asking many questions, and demanding more particularly to see this Ghino. But Ghino passed over part of what he said as vain, and the rest he answered very courteously, declaring that Ghino meant to make him a visit very soon, and then left him. He saw him no more till next morning, when he brought him as much bread and wine as before, and in the same manner. And thus he continued during many days, till he found the Abbot had eaten some dried beans, which he had left purposely in the chamber, when he inquired of him, as from Ghino, how he found his stomach? The Abbot replied, ‘I should be well enough were I out of this man’s clutches. There is nothing I want now so much as to eat, for his medicines have had such an effect upon me, that I am fit to die with hunger.” Ghino, then, having furnished a room with the Abbot’s own goods, and provided an elegant entertainment, to which many people of the town were invited, as well as the Abbot’s own domestics, went the next morning to him, and said, ‘My Lord, now you find yourself recovered, it is time for you to quit this infirmary.’ So he took him by the hand, and led him into the chamber, leaving him there with his own people; and as he went out to give orders about the feast, the Abbot was giving an account how he had led his life in that place, whilst they declared that they had been used by Ghino with all possible respect. When the time came, they sat down and were nobly entertained, but still without Ghino’s making himself known. But after the Abbot had continued some days in that manner, Ghino had all the goods and furniture brought into a large room, and the horses were likewise led into the courtyard which was under it, when he inquired how his Lordship now found himself, or whether he was yet able to ride. The Abbot made answer that he was strong enough, and his stomach perfectly well, and that he only wanted to quit this man. Ghino then brought him into the room where all his goods were, showing him also to the window, that he might take a view of his horses, when he said, ‘My Lord, you must understand it was no evil disposition, but his being driven a poor exile from his own house, and persecuted with many enemies, that forced Ghino di Tacco, whom I am, to be a robber upon the highways, and an enemy to the court of Rome. You seem, however, to be a person of honor; as, therefore, I have cured you of your pain in your stomach, I do not mean to treat you as I would do another person that should fall into my hands, that is, to take what I please, but I would have you consider my necessity, and then give me what you will yourself. Here is all that belongs to you; the horses you may see out of the window: take either part or the whole, just as you are disposed, and go or stay, as is most agreeable to you.’ The Abbot was surprised to hear a highwayman talk in so courteous a manner, which did not a little please him; so, turning all his former passion and resentment into kindness and goodwill, he ran with a heart full of friendship to embrace him: ‘I protest solemnly, that to procure the friendship of such an one as I take you to be, I would undergo more than what you have already made me suffer. Cursed be that evil fortune which has thrown you into this way of life!’ So, taking only a few of his most necessary things, and also of his horses, and leaving all the rest, he came back to Rome. The Pope had heard of the Abbot’s being a prisoner, and though he was much concerned at it, yet, upon seeing him, he inquired what benefit he had received from the baths? The Abbot replied, with a smile, ‘Holy Father, I found a physician much nearer, who has cured me excellently well’; and he told him the manner of it, which made the Pope laugh heartily, when, going on with his story, and moved with a truly generous spirit, he requested of his Holiness one favor. The Pope, imagining he would ask something else, freely consented to grant it. Then said the Abbot, ‘Holy Father, what I mean to require is, that you would bestow a free pardon on Ghino di Tacco, my doctor, because, of all people of worth that I ever met with, he certainly is most to be esteemed, and the damage he does is more the fault of fortune than himself. Change but his condition, and give him something to live upon, according to his rank and station, and I dare say you will have the same opinion of him that I have.’ The Pope, being of a noble spirit, and a great encourager of merit, promised to do so, it he was such a person as he reported, and, in the meantime, gave letters of safe-conduct for his coming thither. Upon that assurance, Ghino came to court, when the Pope was soon convinced of his worth, and reconciled to him, giving him the priory of an hospital, and creating him a knight. And there he continued as a friend and loyal servant to the Holy Church, and to the Abbot of Cligni, as long as he lived.”</p>

					<p>Dante, in his treatise <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">De Volgari Eloquio</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 15, speaks of Sordello of Mantua as “a man so choice in his language, that not only in his poems, but in whatever way he spoke, he abandoned the dialect of his province.” But here there is no question of the Provençal in which Sordello the Troubadour wrote, but only of Italian dialects in comparison with the universal and cultivated Italian, which Dante says “belongs to all the Italian cities, and seems to belong exclusively to none.” In the same treatise, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 13, he mentions a certain Gotto of Mantua as the author of many good songs; and this Gotto is supposed to be Sordello, as Sordello was born at Goïto in the province of Mantua. But would Dante in the same treatise allude to the same person under different names? Is not this rather the Sordel de Goi, mentioned by Raynouard, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Choix de Poésies Originales des Troubadours</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 445?</p>
					<p>In the old Provençal manuscript quoted by Raynouard, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Choix de Poésies Originales des Troubadours</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 444, Sordello’s biography is thus given:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Sordello was a Mantuan of Sirier, son of a poor knight, whose name was Sir El Cort. And he delighted in learning songs and in making them, and rivalled the good men of the court as far as possible, and wrote love-songs and satires. And he came to the court of the Count of Saint Boniface, and the Count honored him greatly, and by way of pastime (<i xml:lang="la">a forma de solatz</i>) he fell in love with the wife of the Count, and she with him. And it happened that the Count quarrelled with her brothers, and became estranged from her. And her brothers, Sir Icellis and Sir Albrics, persuaded Sir Sordello to run away with her; and he came to live with them in great content. And afterwards he went into Provence, and received great honor from all good men, and from the Count and Countess, who gave him a good castle and a gentlewoman for his wife.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Citing this passage, Millot, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Histoire Littéraire des Troubadours</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 80, goes on to say:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“This is all that our manuscripts tell us of Sordello. According to Agnelli and Platina, historians of Mantua, he was of the house of the Visconti of that city; valiant in deeds of arms, famous in jousts and tournaments, he won the love of Beatrice, daughter of Ezzelin da Romano, Lord of the Marca Trevigiana, and married her; he governed Mantua as Podestà and Captain-General; and though son-in-law of the tyrant Ezzelin, he always opposed him, being a great lover of justice.</p>
						<p>“We find these facts cited by Crescimbeni, who says that Sordello was the lord of Goïto; but as they are not applicable to our poet, we presume they refer to a warrior of the same name, and perhaps of a different family.</p>
						<p>“Among the pieces of Sordello, thirty-four in number, there are some fifteen songs of gallantry, though Nostrodamus says that all his pieces turn only upon philosophic subjects.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Nostrodamus’s account, as given by Crescimbeni, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">L’Istoria Della Volgar Poesia</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 105, is as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Sordello was a Mantuan poet, who surpassed in Provençal song Calvo, Folchetto of Marseilles, Lanfranco Cicala, Percival Doria, and all the other Genoese and Tuscan poets, who took far greater delight in our Provençal tongue, on account of its sweetness, than in their own maternal language. This poet was very studious, and exceeding eager to know all things, and as much as any one of his nation excellent in learning as well as in understanding and in prudence. He wrote several beautiful songs, not indeed of love, for not one of that kind is found among his works, but on philosophic subjects. Raymond Belinghieri, the last Count of Provence of that name, in the last days of his life, (the poet being then but fifteen years of age,) on account of the excellence of his poetry and the rare invention shown in his productions, took him into his service, as Pietro di Castelnuovo, himself a Provençal poet, informs us. He also wrote various satires in the same language, and among others one in which he reproves all the Christian princes; and it is composed in the form of a funeral song on the death of Blancasso.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Histoire Littéraire de la France</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIX</span> 452, Eméric-David, after discussing the subject at length, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Who then is this Sordello, haughty and superb, like a lion in repose⁠—this Sordello, who, in embracing Virgil, gives rise to this sudden explosion of the patriotic sentiments of Dante? Is it a singer of love and gallantry? Impossible. This Sordello is the old Podestà of Mantua, as decided a Ghibelline as Dante himself; and Dante utters before him sentiments which he well knows the zealous Ghibclline will share. And what still more confirms our judgment is, that Sordello embraces the knees of Virgil, exclaiming, ‘O glory of the Latians,’ <abbr class="eoc">etc.</abbr> In this admiration, in this love of the Latin tongue, we still see the Podestà, the writer of Latin; we do not see the Troubadour.”</p>
						<p>Benvenuto calls Sordello a “noble and prudent knight,” and “a man of singular virtue in the world, though of impenitent life,” and tells a story he has heard of him and Cunizza, but does not vouch for it. “Ezzelino,” he says, “had a sister greatly addicted to the pleasures of love, concerning whom much is said in the ninth Canto of Paradiso. She, being enamored of Sordello, had cautiously contrived that he should visit her at night by a back door near the kitchen of her palace at Verona. And as there was in the street a dirty slough in which the swine wallowed, and puddles of filthy water, so that the place would seem in no way suspicious, he caused himself to be carried by her servant to the door where Cunizza stood ready to receive him. Ezzelino having heard of this, one evening, disguised as a servant, carried Sordello, and brought him back. Which done, he discovered himself to Sordello, and said, ‘Enough; abstain in future from doing so foul a deed in so foul a place.’ Sordello, terrified, humbly besought pardon; promising never more to return to his sister. But the accursed Cunizza again enticed him into his former error. Wherefore, fearing Ezzelino, the most formidable man of his time, he left the city. But Ezzelino, as some say, afterwards had him put to death.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>He says, moreover, that Dante places Sordello alone and separate from the others, like Saladin in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Inferno</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 129, on account of his superiority, or because he wrote a book entitled “The Treasure of Treasures”; and that Sordello was a Mantuan of the village of Goïto⁠—“beautiful of person, valiant of spirit, gentle of manner.”</p>
					<p>Finally, Quadrio, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="it">Storia d’ogni Poesia</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 130, easily cuts the knot which no one can untie; but unfortunately he does not give his authorities. He writes:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Sordello, native of Goïto, (Sordel de Goi,) a village in the Mantuan territory, was born in 1184, and was the son of a poor knight named Elcort.” He then repeats the story of Count Saint Boniface, and of Sordello’s reception by Count Raymond in Provence, and adds: “Having afterwards returned to Italy, he governed Mantua with the title of Regent and Captain-General; and was opposed to the tyrant Ezzelino, being a great lover of justice, as Agnelli writes. Finally he died, very old and full of honor, about 1280. He wrote not only in Provençal, but also in our own common Italian tongue; and he was one of those poets who avoided the dialect of his own province, and used the good, choice language, as Dante affirms in his book of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Volgar Eloquenza</i>.”</p>

					<p>Albert, son of the Emperor Rudolph, was the second of the house of Hapsburg who bore the title of King of the Romans. He was elected in 1298, but never went to Italy to be crowned. He came to an untimely and violent death, by the hand of his nephew John, in 1308. This is the judgment of Heaven to which Dante alludes.</p>
					<p>His successor was Henry of Luxembourg, Dante’s “divine and triumphant Henry,” who, in 1311, was crowned at Milan with the Iron Crown of Lombardy, <i xml:lang="it">Il Sacro Chiodo</i>, as it is sometimes called, from the plate of iron with which the crown is lined, being, according to tradition, made from a nail of the Cross. In 1312, he was again crowned with the Golden Crown at Rome, and died in the following year. “But the end of his career drew on,” says Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 520. “He had now advanced, at the head of an army which his enemies dared not meet in the field, towards Siena. He rode still, seemingly in full vigor and activity. But the fatal air of Rome had smitten his strength. A carbuncle had formed under his knee; injudicious remedies inflamed his vitiated blood. He died at Buonconvento, in the midst of his awestruck army, on the festival of <abbr>St.</abbr> Bartholomew. Rumors of foul practice, of course, spread abroad; a Dominican monk was said to have administered poison in the Sacrament, which he received with profound devotion. His body was carried in sad state, and splendidly interred at Pisa.</p>
					<p>“So closed that empire, in which, if the more factious and vulgar Ghibellines beheld their restoration to their native city, their triumph, their revenge, their sole administration of public affairs, the nobler Ghibellinism of Dante foresaw the establishment of a great universal monarchy necessary to the peace and civilization of mankind. The ideal sovereign of Dante’s famous treatise on Monarchy was Henry of Luxembourg. Neither Dante nor his time can be understood but through this treatise. The attempt of the Pope to raise himself to a great pontifical monarchy had manifestly ignominiously failed: the Ghibelline is neither amazed nor distressed at this event. It is now the turn of the Imperialist to unfold his noble vision. ‘An universal monarchy is absolutely necessary for the welfare of the world’; and this is part of his singular reasoning: ‘Peace,’ (says the weary exile, the man worn out in cruel strife, the wanderer from city to city, each of those cities more fiercely torn by faction than the last,) ‘universal Peace is the first blessing of mankind. The angels sang, not riches or pleasures, but peace on earth: peace the Lord bequeathed to his disciples. For peace One must rule. Mankind is most like God when at unity, for God is One; therefore under a monarchy. Where there is parity there must be strife; where strife, judgment; the judge must be a third party intervening with supreme authority.’ Without monarchy can be no justice, nor even liberty; for Dante’s monarch is no arbitrary despot, but a constitutional sovereign; he is the Roman law impersonated in the Emperor; a monarch who should leave all the nations, all the free Italian cities, in possession of, their rights and old municipal institutions.” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-618" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The state of Rome in Dante’s time is thus described by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> Norton, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Travel and Study</i>, <abbr>pp.</abbr> 246⁠–⁠248:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“On the slope of the Quirinal Hill, in the quiet enclosure of the convent of <abbr>St.</abbr> Catharine of Siena, stands a square, brick tower, seven stories high. It is a conspicuous object in any general view of Rome; for there are few other towers so tall, and there is not a single spire or steeple in the city. It is the Torre delle Milizie. It was begun by Pope Gregory the Ninth, and finished near the end of the thirteenth century by his vigorous and warlike successor, Boniface the Eighth. Many such towers were built for the purposes of private warfare, in those times when the streets of Rome were the fightingplaces of its noble families; but this is, perhaps, the only one that now remains undiminished in height and unaltered in appearance. It was a new building when Dante visited Rome; and it is one of the very few edifices that still preserve the aspect they then presented. The older ruins have been greatly changed in appearance, and most of the structures of the Middle Ages have disappeared, in the vicissitudes of the last few centuries. The Forum was then filled with a confused mass of ruins and miserable dwellings, with no street running through their intricacies. The Capitol was surrounded with uneven battlemented walls, and bore the character and look of an irregular citadel. <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter’s was a low basilica; the Colosseum had suffered little from the attacks of Popes or princes, neither the Venetian nor the Farnese palace having as yet been built with stones from its walls; and centuries were still to pass before Michel Angelo, Bernini, and Borromini were to stamp its present character upon the face of the modern city. The siege and burning of Rome by Robert Guiscard, in 1084, may be taken as the dividing-line between the city of the Emperors and the city of the Popes, between ancient and modern Rome.⁠ ⁠… Rome was in a state of too deep depression, its people were too turbulent and unsettled, to have either the spirit or the opportunity for great works. There was no established and recognized authority, no regular course of justice. There was not even any strong force, rarely any overwhelming violence, which for a time at least could subdue opposition, and organize a steady, and consequently a beneficent tyranny. The city was continually distracted by petty personal quarrels, and by bitter family feuds. Its obscure annals are full of bloody civil victories and defeats⁠—victories which brought no gain to those who won them, defeats which taught no lesson to those who lost them. The breath of liberty never inspired with life the dead clay of Rome; and though for a time it might seem to kindle some vital heat, the glow soon grew cold, and speedily disappeared. The records of Florence, Siena, Bologna, and Perugia are as full of fighting and bloodshed as those of Rome; but their fights were not mere brawh, nor were their triumphs always barren. Even the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, which were like the coming of the spring after a long winter, making the earth to blossom, and gladdening the hearts of men⁠—the centuries which elsewhere in Italy, and over the rest of Europe, gave birth to the noblest medieval Art, when every great city was adorning itself with the beautiful works of the new architecture, sculpture, and painting⁠—even these centuries left scarcely any token of their passage over Rome. The sun, breaking through the clouds that had long hidden it, shone everywhere but here. While Florence was building her Cathedral and her Campanile, and Orvieto her matchless Duomo⁠—while Pisa was showing her piety and her wealth in her Cathedral, her Camposanto, her Baptistery, and her Tower⁠—while Siena was beginning a church greater and more magnificent in design than her shifting fortune would permit her to complete⁠—Rome was building neither cathedral nor campanile, but was selling the marbles of her ancient temples and tombs to the builders of other cities, or quarrying them for her own mean uses.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“It was not the simple movement of one great body against another; not the force of a government in opposition to the people; not the struggle of privilege and democracy, of poverty and riches, or starvation and repletion; but one universal burst of unmitigated anarchy. In the streets, lanes, and squares, in the courts of palaces and humbler dwellings, were heard the clang of arms, the screams of victims, and the gush of blood: the bow of the bridegroom launched its arrows into the very chambers of his young bride’s parents and relations, and the bleeding son, the murdered brother, or the dying husband were the evening visitors of Florentine maids and matrons, and aged citizens. Every art was practised to seduce and deceive, and none felt secure even of their nearest and dearest relatives. In the morning a son left his paternal roof with undiminished love, and returned at evening a corpse, or the most bitter enemy! Terror and death were triumphant; there was no relaxation, no peace by day or night: the crash of the stone, the twang of the bow, the whizzing shaft, the jar of the trembling mangonel from tower and turret, were the dismal music of Florence, not only for hours and days, but months and years. Doors, windows, the jutting galleries and roofs, were all defended, and yet all unsafe: no spot was sacred, no tenement secure: in the dead of night, the most secret chambers, the very hangings, even the nuptial bed itself, were often known to conceal an enemy.</p>
						<p>“Florence in those days was studded with lofty towers; most of the noble families possessed one or more, at least two hundred feet in height, and many of them far above that altitude. These were their pride, their family, citadels; and jealously guarded; glittering with arms and men, and instruments of war. Every connecting balcony was alive with soldiers; the battle raged above and below, within and without; stones rained in showers, arrows flew thick and fast on every side; the <em>seragli</em>, or barricades, were attacked and defended by chosen bands armed with lances and boar-spears; foes were in ambush at every corner, watching the bold or heedless enemy; confusion was everywhere triumphant, a demon seemed to possess the community, and the public mind, reeling with hatred, was steady only in the pursuit of blood. Yet so accustomed did they at last become to this fiendish life, that one day they fought, the next caroused together in drunken gambols, foe with foe, boasting of their mutual prowess; nor was it until after nearly five years of reciprocal destruction, that, from mere lassitude, they finally ceased thus to mangle each other, and, as it were for relaxation, turned their fury on the neighboring states.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“A characteristic, and, if discreetly handled, a wise regulation of the Florentines, notwithstanding Dante’s sarcasms, was the periodical revision of their statutes and ordinances, a weeding out, as it were, of the obsolete and contradictory, and a substitution of those which were better adapted to existing circumstances and the forward movement of man. There are certain fundamental laws necessarily permanent and admitted by all communities, as there are certain moral and theological truths acknowledged by all religions; but these broad frames or outlines are commonly filled up with a thick network of subordinate regulations, that cover them like cobwebs, and often impede the march of improvement. The Florentines were early aware of this, and therefore revised their laws and institutions more or less frequently and sometimes factiously, according to the turbulent or tranquil condition of the times; but in 1394, after forty years’ omission, an officer was nominated for that purpose, but whether permanently or not is doubtful.”</p>

					<p>Of this description Ruskin, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Modern Painters</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 228, remarks:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Now, almost in the opening of the Purgatory, as there at the entrance of the Inferno, we find a company of great ones resting in a grassy place. But the idea of the grass now is very different. The word now used is not ‘enamel,’ but ‘herb,’ and instead of being merely green, it is covered with flowers of many colors. With the usual mediseval accuracy, Dante insists on telling us precisely what these colors were, and how bright; which he does by naming the actual pigments used in illumination⁠—‘Gold, and fine silver, and cochineal, and white lead, and Indian wood, serene and lucid, and fresh emerald, just broken, would have been excelled, as less is by greater, by the flowers and grass of the place.’ It is evident that the ‘emerald’ here means the emerald green of the illuminators; for a fresh emerald is no brighter than one which is not fresh, and Dante was not one to throw away his words thus. Observe, then, we have here the idea of the growth, life, and variegation of the ‘green herb,’ as opposed to the smalto of the Inferno; but the colors of the variegation are illustrated and defined by the reference to actual pigments; and, observe, because the other colors are rather bright, the blue ground (Indian wood, indigo?) is sober; lucid, but serene; and presently two angels enter, who are dressed in the green drapery, but of a paler green than the grass, which Dante marks, by telling us that it was ‘the green of leaves just budded.’</p>
						<p>“In all this, I wish the reader to observe two things: first, the general carefulness of the poet in defining color, distinguishing it precisely as a painter would (opposed to the Greek carelessness about it); and, secondly, his regarding the grass for its greenness and variegation, rather than, as a Greek would have done, for its depth and freshness. This greenness or brightness, and variegation, are taken up by later and modern poets, as the things intended to be chiefly expressed by the word ‘enamelled’; and, gradually, the term is taken to indicate any kind of bright and interchangeable coloring; there being always this much of propriety about it, when used of greensward, that such sward is indeed, like enamel, a coat of bright color on a comparatively dark ground; and is thus a sort of natural jewelry and painter’s work, different from loose and large vegetation. The word is often awkwardly and falsely used, by the later poets, of all kinds of growth and color; as by Milton of the flowers of Paradise showing themselves over its wall; but it retains, nevertheless, through all its jaded inanity, some halfunconscious vestige of the old sense, even to the present day.”</p>

Ottocar presented himself covered with gold and jewels; Rudolph, by way of superior pomp, received him in his simplest dress; and in the middle of the ceremony the curtains of the tent fell, and revealed to the eyes of the people and of the armies, that lined the Danube, the proud Ottocar on his knees, with his hands clasped in the hands of his conqueror, whom he had often called his maître d’hôtel, and whose Grand-Seneschal he now became.

He laughed but little; was chaste as a monk, catholic, harsh in judgment, and of a fierce countenance; large and muscular in person, with an olive complexion and a large nose, and looked the king more than any other lord. He sat up late at night, and slept little, and was in the habit of saying that a great deal of time was lost in sleeping. He was generous to his knights, but eager to acquire land, lordship, and money wherever he could, to furnish means for his enterprises and wars. In courtiers, minstrels, and players he never took delight.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Yet this is the monarch whose tyranny in Sicily brought about the bloody revenge of the Sicilian Vespers; which in turn so roused the wrath of Charles, that he swore that, “if he could live a thousand years, he would go on razing the cities, burning the lands, torturing the rebellious slaves.

He had embarked with his knights for the South of France; he was cast back by tempests on the shores of Spain. He set off with some of his armed companions, crossed the Pyrenees undiscovered, appeared before the gates of Bordeaux, and summoned the English Seneschal. To him he proclaimed himself to be the king of Aragon, demanded to see the lists, rode down them in slow state, obtained an attestation that he had made his appearance within the covenanted time, and affixed his solemn protest against the palpable premeditated treachery of his rival, which made it unsafe for him to remain longer at Bordeaux. Charles, on his part, was furious that Peter had thus broken through the spider’s web of his policy. He was in Bordeaux when Peter appeared under the walls, and had challenged him in vain.

					<p>Green, the color of hope, which is the distinguishing virtue of Purgatory. On the symbolism of colors, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Jameson, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Sacred and Legendary Art</i>, <abbr>Introd.</abbr>, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In very early Art we find colors used in a symbolical or mystic sense, and, until the ancient principles and traditions were wholly worn out of memory or set aside by the later painters, certain colors were appropriated to certain subjects and personages, and could not arbitrarily be applied or misapplied. In the old specimens of stained glass we find these significations scrupulously attended to. Thus:⁠—</p>
						<p>“<b>White</b>, represented by the diamond or silver, was the emblem of light, religious purity, innocence, virginity, faith, joy, and life. Our Saviour wears white after his resurrection. In the judge it indicated integrity; in the rich man, humility; in the woman, chastity. It was the color consecrated to the Virgin, who, however, never wears white except in pictures of the Assumption.</p>
						<p>“<b>Red</b>, the ruby, signified fire, divine love, the Holy Spirit, heat, or the creative power, and royalty. White and red roses expressed love and innocence, or love and wisdom, as in the garland with which the angel crowns <abbr>St.</abbr> Cecilia. In a bad sense, red signified blood, war, hatred, and punishment. Red and black combined were the colors of purgatory and the Devil.</p>
						<p>“<b>Blue</b>, or the sapphire, expressed heaven, the firmament, truth, constancy, fidelity. Christ and the Virgin wear the red tunic and the blue mantle, as signifying heavenly love and heavenly truth.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2104" id="noteref-2104" epub:type="noteref">2104</a> The same colors were given to <abbr>St.</abbr> John the Evangelist, with this difference⁠—that he wore the blue tunic and the red mantle; in later pictures the colors are sometimes red and green.</p>
						<p>“<b>Yellow</b>, or gold, was the symbol of the sun; of the goodness of God; initiation, or marriage; faith, or fruitfulness. <abbr>St.</abbr> Joseph, the husband of the Virgin, wears yellow. In pictures of the Apostles, <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter wears a yellow mantle over a blue tunic. In a bad sense, yellow signifies inconstancy, jealousy, deceit; in this sense it is given to the traitor Judas, who is generally habited in dirty yellow.</p>
						<p>“<b>Green</b>, the emerald, is the color of spring; of hope, particularly hope in immortality; and of victory, as the color of the palm and the laurel.</p>
						<p>“<b>Violet</b>, the amethyst, signified love and truth; or, passion and suffering. Hence it is the color often worn by the martyrs. In some instances our Saviour, after his resurrection, is habited in a violet, instead of a blue mantle. The Virgin also wears violet after the crucifixion. Mary Magdalene, who as patron saint wears the red robe, as penitent wears violet and blue, the colors of sorrow and of constancy. In the devotional representation of her by Timoteo della Vite, she wears red and green, the colors of love and hope.</p>
						<p>“<b>Gray</b>, the color of ashes, signified mourning, humility, and innocence accused; hence adopted as the dress of the Franciscans (the Gray Friars); but it has since been changed for a dark rusty brown.</p>
						<p>“<b>Black</b> expressed the earth, darkness, mourning, wickedness, negation, death; and was appropriate to the Prince of Darkness. In some old illuminated <abbr>MSS.</abbr>, Jesus, in the Temptation, wears a black robe. White and black together signified purity of life, and mourning or humiliation; hence adopted by the Dominicans and the Carmelites.”</p>

Some maintain that he means the aurora of the sun; but this cannot be, if we closely examine the text.” This point is elaborately discussed by the commentators. I agree with those who interpret the passage as referring to a lunar aurora. It is still evening; and the hour is indicated a few lines lower down.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“On it he wrought the earth, and the heaven, and the sea, the unwearied sun, and the full moon. On it also he represented all the constellations with which the heaven is crowned, the Pleiades, the Hyades, and the strength of Orion, and the Bear, which they also call by the appellation of the Wain, which there revolves, and watches Orion; but it alone is free from the baths of the ocean.</p>
						<p>“In it likewise he wrought two fair cities of articulate speaking men. In the one, indeed, there were marriages and feasts; and they were conducting the brides from their chambers through the city with brilliant torches, and many a bridal song was raised. The youthful dancers were wheeling round, and among them pipes and lyres uttered a sound; and the women standing, each at her portals, admired. And people were crowded together in an assembly, and there a contest had arisen; for two men contended for the ransom-money of a slain man: the one affirmed that he had paid all, appealing to the people; but the other denied, averring that he had received naught: and both wished to find an end of the dispute before a judge. The people were applauding both, supporters of either party, and the heralds were keeping back the people; but the elders sat upon polished stones, in a sacred circle, and the pleaders held in their hands the staves of the clear-voiced heralds; with these then they arose, and alternately pleaded their cause. Moreover, in the midst lay two talents of gold, to give to him who should best establish his claim among them. But round the other city sat two armies of people glittering in arms; and one of two plans was agreeable to them, either to waste it, or to divide all things into two parts⁠—the wealth, whatever the pleasant city contained within it. They, however, had not yet complied, but were secretly arming themselves for an ambuscade. Meanwhile, their beloved wives and young children kept watch, standing above, and among them the men whom old age possessed. But they (the younger men) advanced; but Mars was their leader, and Pallas Minerva, both golden, and clad in golden dresses, beautiful and large, along with their armor, radiant all round, and indeed like gods; but the people were of humbler size. But when they now had reached a place where it appeared fit to lay an ambuscade, by a river, where there was a watering-place for all sorts of cattle, there then they settled, clad in shining steel. There, apart from the people, sat two spies, watching when they might perceive the sheep and crooked-horned oxen. These, however, soon advanced, and two shepherds accompanied them, amusing themselves with their pipes, for they had not yet perceived the stratagem. Then they, discerning them, ran in upon them, and immediately slaughtered on all sides the herds of oxen, and the beautiful flocks of snow-white sheep; and slew the shepherds besides. But they, when they heard the great tumult among the oxen, previously sitting in front of the assembly, mounting their nimble-footed steeds, pursued; and soon came up with them. Then, having marshalled themselves, they fought a battle on the banks of the river, and wounded one another with their brazen spears. Among them mingled Discord and Tumult, and destructive Fate, holding one alive recently wounded, another unwounded, but a third, slain, she drew by the feet through the battle; and had the garment around her shoulders crimsoned with the gore of men. But they turned about, like living mortals, and fought, and drew away the slaughtered bodies of each other.</p>
						<p>“On it he also placed a soft fallow field, rich glebe, wide, thrice-ploughed; and in it many ploughmen drove hither and thither, turning round their teams. But when, returning, they reached the end of the field, then a man, advancing, gave into their hands a cup of very sweet wine; but they turned themselves in series, eager to reach the other end of the deep fallow. But it was all black behind, similar to ploughed land, which indeed was a marvel beyond all others.</p>
						<p>“On it likewise he placed a field of deep corn, where reapers were cutting, having sharp sickles in their hands. Some handfuls fell one after the other upon the ground along the furrow, and the binders of sheaves tied others with bands. Three binders followed the reapers, while behind them boys gathering the handfuls, and bearing them in their arms, continually supplied them; and among them the master stood by the swath in silence, holding a sceptre, delighted in heart. But apart, beneath an oak, servants were preparing a banquet, and, sacrificing a huge ox, they ministered; while women sprinkled much white barley on the meat, as a supper for the reapers.</p>
						<p>“On it likewise he placed a vineyard, heavily laden with grapes, beautiful, golden; but the clusters throughout were black; and it was supported throughout by silver poles. Round ic he drew an azure trench, and about it a hedge of tin; but there was only one path to it, by which the gatherers went when they collected the vintage. Young virgins and youths, of tender minds, bore the luscious fruit in woven baskets, in the midst of whom a boy played sweetly on a shrill harp; and with tender voice sang gracefully to the chord; while they, beating the ground in unison with dancing and shouts, followed, skipping with their feet.</p>
						<p>“In it he also wrought a herd of oxen with horns erect. But the kine were made of gold and of tin, and rushed out with a lowing from the stall to the pasture, beside a murmuring stream, along the breeze-waving reeds. Four golden herdsmen accompanied the oxen, and nine dogs, swift of foot, followed. But two terrible lions detained the bull, roaring among the foremost oxen, and he was dragged away, loudly bellowing, and the dogs and youths followed for a rescue. They indeed, having torn off the skin of the great ox, lapped up his entrails and black blood; and the shepherds vainly pressed upon them, urging on their fleet dogs. These however refused to bite the lions, but, standing very near, barked, and shunned them.</p>
						<p>“On it illustrious Vulcan also formed a pasture in a beautiful grove full of white sheep, and folds, and covered huts and cottages.</p>
						<p>“Illustrious Vulcan likewise adorned it with a dance, like unto that which, in wide Gnossus, Dsdalus contrived for fair-haired Ariadne. There danced youths and alluring virgins, holding each other’s hands at the wrist. These wore fine linen robes, but those were dressed in well-woven tunics, shining as with oil; these also had beautiful garlands, and those wore golden swords, hanging from silver belts. Sometimes, with skilful feet, they nimbly bounded round; as when a potter, sitting, shall make trial of a wheel fitted to his hands, whether it will run: and at other times again they ran back to their places through one another. But a great crowd surrounded the pleasing dance, amusing themselves; and among them two tumblers, beginning their songs, spun round through the midst.</p>
						<p>“But in it he also formed the vast strength of the river Oceanus, near the last border of the well-formed shield.”</p>

					<p>This story of Trajan is told in nearly the same words, though in prose, in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="it">Fiore di Filosofi</i>, a work attributed to Brunetto Latini.

					<p>As told by Ser Brunetto the story runs thus:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Trajan was a very just Emperor, and one day, having mounted his horse to go into battle with his cavalry, a woman came and seized him by the foot, and, weeping bitterly, asked him and besought him to do justice upon those who had without cause put to death her son, who was an upright young man. And he answered and said, ‘I will give thee satisfaction when I return.’ And she said, ‘And if thou dost not return?’ And he answered, ‘If I do not return, my successor will give thee satisfaction.’ And she said, ‘How do I know that? and suppose he do it, what is it to thee if another do good? Thou art my debtor, and according to thy deeds shalt thou be judged; it is a fraud for a man not to pay what he owes; the justice of another will not liberate thee, and it will be well for thy successor if he shall liberate himself.’ Moved by these words the Emperor alighted, and did justice, and consoled the widow, and then mounted his horse, and went to battle, and routed his enemies. A long time afterwards <abbr>St.</abbr> Gregory, hearing of this justice, saw his statue, and had him disinterred, and found that he was all turned to dust, except his bones and his tongue, which was like that of a living man. And by this <abbr>St.</abbr> Gregory knew his justice, for this tongue had always spoken it; so that then he wept very piteously through compassion, praying God that he would take this soul out of Hell, knowing that he had been a Pagan. Then God, because of these prayers, drew that soul from pain, and put it into glory. And thereupon the angel spoke to <abbr>St.</abbr> Gregory, and told him never to make such a prayer again, and God laid upon him as a penance either to be two days in Purgatory, or to be always ill with fever and side-ache. <abbr>St.</abbr> Gregory as the lesser punishment chose the fever and side-ache (<i xml:lang="it">male di fianco</i>).”</p>

In my book of ancient drawings I have some few remains from the hand of this artist, who was certainly a clever man, although much surpassed by Franco of Bologna, who executed many admirable works in the same manner, for the same Pontiff, (and which were also destined for the library of the palace,) at the same time with those of Oderigi. From the hand of Franco also, I have designs, both in painting and illuminating, which may be seen in my book above cited; among others are an eagle, perfectly well done, and a lion tearing up a tree, which is most beautiful.”</p>

					<p>“The overwhelming flood of evils by which unhappy Italy had been submerged and devastated had not only destroyed whatever could properly be called buildings, but, a still more deplorable consequence, had totally exterminated the artists themselves, when, by the will of God, in the year 1240, Giovanni Cimabue, of the noble family of that name, was born, in the city of Florence, to give the first light to the art of painting. This youth, as he grew up, being considered by his father and others to give proof of an acute judgment and a clear understanding, was sent to Santa Maria Novella to study letters under a relation, who was then master in grammar to the novices of that convent. But Cimabue, instead of devoting himself to letters, consumed the whole day in drawing men, horses, houses, and other various fancies, on his books and different papers⁠—an occupation to which he felt himself impelled by nature; and this natural inclination was favored by fortune, for the governors of the city had invited certain Greek painters to Florence, for the purpose of restoring the art of painting, which had not merely degenerated, but was altogether lost. These artists, among other works, began to paint the Chapel of the Gondi, situate next the principal chapel, in Santa Maria Novella, the roof and walls of which are now almost entirely destroyed by time⁠—and Cimabue, often escaping from the school, and having already made a commencement in the art he was so fond of, would stand watching those masters at their work, the day through. Judging from these circumstances, his father, as well as the artists themselves, concluded him to be well endowed for painting, and thought that much might be hoped from his future efforts, if he were devoted to that art. Giovanni was accordingly, to his no small satisfaction, placed with those masters. From this time he labored incessantly, and was so far aided by his natural powers that he soon greatly surpassed his teachers both in design and coloring. For these masters, caring little for the progress of art, had executed their works as we now see them, not in the excellent manner of the ancient Greeks, but in the rude modern style of their own day. Wherefore, though Cimabue imitated his Greek instructors, he very much improved the art, relieving it greatly from their uncouth manner, and doing honor to his country by the name he acquired, and by the works which he performed. Of this we have evidence in Florence from the pictures which he painted there; as, for example, the front of the altar of Santa Cecilia, and a picture of the Virgin, in Santa Croce, which was, and is still, attached to one of the pilasters on the right of the choir.” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-721" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“The gratitude which the masters in painting owe to Nature⁠—who is ever the truest model of him who, possessing the power to select the brightest parts from her best and loveliest features, employs himself unweariedly in the reproduction of these beauties⁠—this gratitude, I say, is due, in my judgment, to the Florentine painter Giotto, seeing that he alone⁠—although born amidst incapable artists, and at a time when all good methods in art had long been entombed beneath the ruins of war⁠—yet, by the favor of Heaven, he, I say, alone succeeded in resuscitating Art, and restoring her to a path that may be called the true one. And it was in truth a great marvel, that from so rude and inapt an age Giotto should have had strength to elicit so much, that the art of design, of which the men of those days had little, if any knowledge, was by his means effectually recalled into life. The birth of this great man took place in the hamlet of Vespignano, fourteen miles from the city of Florence, in the year 1276. His father’s name was Bondone, a simple husbandman, who reared the child, to whom he had given the name of Giotto, with such decency as his condition permitted. The boy was early remarked for extreme vivacity in all his childish proceedings, and for extraordinary promptitude of intelligence; so that he became endeared, not only to his father, but to all who knew him in the village and around it. When he was about ten years old, Bondone gave him a few sheep to watch, and with these he wandered about the vicinity⁠—now here and now there. But, induced by Nature herself to the arts of design, he was perpetually drawing on the stones, the earth, or the sand, some natural object that came before him, or some fantasy that presented itself to his thoughts. It chanced one day that the affairs of Cimabue took him from Florence to Vespignano, when he perceived the young Giotto, who, while his sheep fed around him, was occupied in drawing one of them from the life, with a stone slightly pointed, upon a smooth, clean piece of rock⁠—and that without any teaching whatever but such as Nature herself had imparted. Halting in astonishment, Cimabue inquired of the boy if he would accompany him to his home, and the child replied, he would go willingly, if his father were content to permit it. Cimabue therefore requesting the consent of Bondone, the latter granted it readily, and suffered the artist to conduct his son to Florence, where, in a short time, instructed by Cimabue and aided by Nature, the boy not only equalled his master in his own manner, but became so good an imitator of Nature that he totally banished the rude Greek manner, restoring art to the better path adhered to in modern times, and introducing the custom of accurately drawing living persons from nature, which had not been used for more than two hundred years. Or, if some had attempted it, as said above, it was not by any means with the success of Giotto. Among the portraits by this artist, and which still remain, is one of his contemporary and intimate friend, Dante Alighieri, who was no less famous as a poet than Giotto as a painter, and whom Messer Giovanni Boccaccio has lauded so highly in the introduction to his story of Messer Forese da Rabatta, and of Giotto the painter himself. This portrait is in the chapel of the palace of the Podestà in Florence; and in the same chapel are the portraits of Ser Brunetto Latini, master of Dante, and of Messer Corso Donati, an illustrious citizen of that day.”</p>

					<p>Pope Benedict the Ninth, hearing of Giotto’s fame, sent one of his courtiers to Tuscany, to propose to him certain paintings for the Church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The messenger,” continues Vasari, “when on his way to visit Giotto, and to inquire what other good masters there were in Florence, spoke first with many artists in Siena⁠—then, having received designs from them, he proceeded to Florence, and repaired one morning to the workshop where Giotto was occupied with his labors. He declared the purpose of the Pope, and the manner in which that Pontiff desired to avail himself of his assistance; and, finally, requested to have a drawing, that he might send it to his Holiness, Giotto, who was very courteous, took a sheet of paper and a pencil dipped in a red color, then, resting his elbow on his side, to form a sort of compass, with one turn of the hand he drew a circle, so perfect and exact that it was a marvel to behold. This done, he turned smiling to the courtier, saying, ‘Here is your drawing.’ ‘Am I to have nothing more than this?’ inquired the latter, conceiving himself to be jested with. ‘That is enough and to spare,’ returned Giotto; ‘send it with the rest, and you will see if it will be recognized.’ The messenger, unable to obtain anything more, went away very ill satisfied, and fearing that he had been fooled. Nevertheless, having despatched the other drawings to the Pope, with the names of those who had done them, he sent that of Giotto also, relating the mode in which he had made his circle, without moving his arm and without compasses; from which the Pope, and such of the courtiers as were well versed in the subject, perceived how far Giotto surpassed all the other painters of his time. This incident, becoming known, gave rise to the proverb, still used in relation to people of dull wits⁠—<i xml:lang="it">Tu sei piu tondo che l’O di Giotto</i>; the significance of which consists in the double meaning of the word ‘tondo,’ which is used in the Tuscan for slowness of intellect and heaviness of comprehension, as well as for an exact circle. The proverb has besides an interest from the circumstance which gave it birth.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“It is said that Giotto, when he was still a boy, and studying with Cimabue, once painted a fly on the nose of a figure on which Cimabue himself was employed, and this so naturally, that, when the master returned to continue his work, he believed it to be real, and lifted his hand more than once to drive it away before he should go on with the painting.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Boccaccio, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decameron</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> 5, tells this tale of Giotto:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“As it often happens that fortune hides under the meanest trades in life the greatest virtues, which has been proved by Pampinea; so are the greatest geniuses found frequently lodged by Nature in the most deformed and misshapen bodies, which was verified in two of our own citizens, as I am now going to relate. For the one, who was called Forese da Rabatta, being a little deformed mortal, with a flat Dutch face, worse than any of the family of the Baronci, yet was he esteemed by most men a repository of the civil law. And the other, whose name was Giotto, had such a prodigious fancy, that there was nothing in Nature, the parent of all things, but he could imitate it with his pencil so well, and draw it so like, as to deceive our very senses, imagining that to be the very thing itself which was only his painting: therefore, having brought that art again to light, which had lain buried for many ages under the errors of such as aimed more to captivate the eyes of the ignorant, than to please the understandings of those who were really judges, he may be deservedly called one of the lights and glories of our city, and the rather as being master of his art, notwithstanding his modesty would never suffer himself to be so esteemed; which honor, though rejected by him, displayed itself in him with the greater lustre, as it was so eagerly usurped by others less knowing than himself, and by many also who had all their knowledge from him. But though his excellence in his profession was so wonderful, yet as to his person and aspect he had no way the advantage of Signor Forese. To come then to my story. These two worthies had each his country-seat at Mugello, and Forese being gone thither in the vacation time, and riding upon an unsightly steed, chanced to meet there with Giotto, who was no better equipped than himself, when they returned together to Florence. Travelling slowly along, as they were able to go no faster, they were overtaken by a great shower of rain, and forced to take shelter in a poor man’s house, who was well known to them both; and, as there was no appearance of the weather’s clearing up, and each being desirous of getting home that night, they borrowed two old, rusty cloaks, and two rusty hats, and they proceeded on their journey. After they had gotten a good part of their way, thoroughly wet, and covered with dirt and mire, which their two shuffling steeds had thrown upon them, and which by no means improved their looks, it began to clear up at last, and they, who had hitherto said but little to each other, now turned to discourse together; whilst Forese, riding along and listening to Giotto, who was excellent at telling a story, began at last to view him attentively from head to foot, and, seeing him in that wretched, dirty pickle, without having any regard to himself he fell a laughing, and said, ‘Do you suppose, Giotto, if a stranger were to meet with you now, who had never seen you before, that he would imagine you to be the best painter in the world, as you really are?’ Giotto readily replied, ‘Yes, sir, I believe he might think so, if, looking at you at the same time, he would ever conclude that you had learned your A. BC’ At this Forese was sensible of his mistake, finding himself well paid in his own coin.”</p>

Its despised perspective, imperfect chiaroscuro, and unrestrained flights of fantastic imagination, separated the artist’s work from nature by an interval which there was no attempt to disguise, and little to diminish. And yet, at this very period, the greatest poet of that, or perhaps of any other age, and the attached friend of its greatest painter, who must over and over again have held full and free conversation with him respecting the objects of his art, speaks in the following terms of painting, supposed to be carried to its highest perfection:⁠—</p>

						<p class="continued">Dante has here clearly no other idea of the highest art than that it should bring back, as in a mirror or vision, the aspect of things passed or absent. The scenes of which he speaks are, on the pavement, forever represented by angelic power, so that the souls which traverse this circle of the rock may see them, as if the years of the world had been rolled back, and they again stood beside the actors in the moment of action. Nor do I think that Dante’s authority is absolutely necessary to compel us to admit that such art as this <em>might</em> indeed be the highest possible. Whatever delight we may have been in the habit of taking in pictures, if it were but truly offered to us to remove at our will the canvas from the frame, and in lieu of it to behold, fixed forever, the image of some of those mightyscenes which it has been our way to make mere themes for the artist’s fancy⁠—if, for instance, we could again behold the Magdalene receiving her pardon at Christ’s feet, or the disciples sitting with him at the table of Emmaus⁠—and this not feebly nor fancifully, but as if some silver mirror, that had leaned against the wall of the chamber, had been miraculously commanded to retain forever the colors that had flashed upon it for an instant⁠—would we not part with our picture, Titian’s or Veronese’s though it might be?”</p>

					<p>A mountain in the Apennines, northeast of Florence, from which the Arno takes its rise. Ampère, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Voyage Dantesque</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 246, thus describes this region of the Val d’ Arno:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Farther on is another tower, the tower of <em>Porciano</em>, which is said to have been inhabited by Dante. From there I had still to climb the summits of the Falterona. I started towards midnight in order to arrive before sunrise. I said to myself. How many times the poet, whose footprints I am following, has wandered in these mountains! It was by these little alpine paths that he came and went, on his way to friends in Romagna or friends in Urbino, his heart agitated with a hope that was never to be fulfilled. I figured to myself Dante walking with a guide under the light of the stars, receiving all the impressions produced by wild and weather-beaten regions, steep roads, deep valleys, and the accidents of a long and difficult route, impressions which he would transfer to his poem. It is enough to have read this poem to be certain that its author has travelled much, has wandered much. Dante really walks with Virgil. He fatigues himself with climbing, he stops to take breath, he uses his hands when feet are insufficient. He gets lost, and asks the way. He observes the height of the sun and stars. In a word, one finds the habits and souvenirs of the traveller in every verse, or rather at every step of his poetic pilgrimage.</p>
						<p>“Dante has certainly climbed the top of the Falterona. It is upon this summit, from which all the Valley of the Arno is embraced, that one should read the singular imprecation which the poet has uttered against this whole valley. He follows the course of the river, and as he advances marks every place he comes to with fierce invective. The farther he goes, the more his hate redoubles in violence and bitterness. It is a piece of topographical satire, of which I know no other example.”</p>

By degenerating into wickedness, then, they must cease to be men. But as virtue alone can exalt a man above what is human, so it is on the contrary evident, that vice, as it divests him of his nature, must sink him below humanity; you ought therefore by no means to consider him as a man whom vice has rendered vicious. Tell me. What difference is there betwixt a wolf who lives by rapine, and a robber whom the desire of another’s wealth stimulates to commit all manner of violence? Is there anything that bears a stronger resemblance to a wrathful dog who barks at passengers, than a man whose dangerous tongue attacks all the world? What is liker to a fox than a cheat, who spreads his snares in secret to undermine and ruin you? to a lion, than a furious man who is always ready to devour you? to a deer, than a coward who is afraid of his own shadow? to an ass, than a mortal who is slow, dull, and indolent? to the birds of the air, than a man volatile and inconstant? and what, in fine, is a debauchee who is immersed in the lowest sensual gratifications, but a hog who wallows in the mire? Upon the whole, it is an unquestionable truth that a man who forsakes virtue ceases to be a man; and, as it is impossible that he can ascend in the scale of beings, he must of necessity degenerate and sink into a beast.”</p>

The only commodity which the Casentines trade in is pork. Signore Baglione, a gentleman at whose house I slept here, ascribed the superior flavor of their hams, which are esteemed the best in Italy and require no cooking, to the dryness of the air, the absence of stagnant water, and the quantity of chestnuts given to their hogs. Bibbiena has been long renowned for its chestnuts, which the peasants dry in a kiln, grind into a sweet flour, and then convert into bread, cakes, and <em>polenta</em>.”</p>

						<p>“The Casentines were no favorites with Dante, who confounds the men with their hogs. Yet, following the <em>divine poet</em> down the Arno, we came to a race still more forbidding. The Aretine peasants seem to inherit the coarse, surly visages of their ancestors, whom he styles <em>Bottoli</em>.

						<p>“The valley widened as we advanced, and when Arezzo appeared, the river left us abruptly, wheeling off from its environs at a sharp angle, which Dante converts into a snout, and points disdainfully against the currish race.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“On entering the Val di Chiana, we passed through a peasantry more civil and industrious than their Aretine neighbors. One poor girl, unlike the last whom we accosted, was driving a laden ass, bearing a billet of wood on her head, spinning with the rocca, and singing as she went on. Others were returning with their sickles from the fields which they had reaped in the Maremma, to their own harvest on the hills. That contrast which struck me in the manners of two cantons so near as Cortona to Arezzo, can only be a vestige of their ancient rivality while separate republics. Men naturally dislike the very virtues of their enemies, and affect qualities as remote from theirs as they can well defend.”</p>

					<p>Marco Lombardo was a Venetian nobleman, a man of wit and learning and a friend of Dante. “Nearly all that he gained,” says the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ottimo</i>, “he spent in charity.⁠ ⁠… He visited Paris, and, as long as his money lasted, he was esteemed for his valor and courtesy.

					<p>It is doubtful whether the name of Lombardo is a family name, or only indicates that Marco was an Italian, after the fashion then prevalent among the French of calling all Italians Lombards. See <a href="#note-848">note 848</a>.</p>
					<p>Benvenuto says of him that he “was a man of noble mind, but disdainful, and easily moved to anger.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“This Marco was a Venetian, called Marco Daca; and was a very learned man, and had many political virtues, and was very courteous, giving to poor noblemen all that he gained, and he gained much; for he was a courtier, and was much beloved for his virtue, and much was given him by the nobility; and as he gave to those who were in need, so he lent to all who asked. So that, coming to die, and having much still due to him, he made a will, and among other bequests this, that whoever owed him should not be held to pay the debt, saying, ‘Whoever has, may keep.’ ”</p>

Now what a person esteems desirable, he desires; but what he thinks ought to be avoided, he shuns. Thus every rational creature hath a liberty of choosing and rejecting. But I do riot assert that this liberty is equal in all beings. Heavenly substances, who are exalted above us, have an enlightened judgment, an incorruptible will, and a power ever at command effectually to accomplish their desires. With regard to man, his immaterial spirit is also free; but it is most at liberty when employed in the contemplation of the Divine mind; it becomes less so when it enters into a body; and is still more restrained when it is imprisoned in a terrestrial habitation, composed of members of clay; and is reduced, in fine, to the most extreme servitude when, by plunging into the pollutions of vice, it totally departs from reason: for the soul no sooner turns her eye from the radiance of supreme truth to dark and base objects, but she is involved in a mist of ignorance, assailed by impure desires; by yielding to which she increases her thraldom, and thus the freedom which she derives from nature becomes in some measure the cause of her slavery. But the eye of Providence, which sees everything from eternity, perceives all this; and that same Providence disposes everything she has predestinated, in the order it deserves. As Homer says of the sun. It sees everything and hears everything.’ ”</p>

						<p>“But I shall now endeavor to demonstrate, that, in whatever way the chain of causes is disposed, the event of things which are foreseen is necessary; although prescience may not appear to be the necessitating cause of their befalling. For example, if a person sits, the opinion formed of him that he is seated is of necessity true; but by inverting the phrase, if the opinion is true that he is seated, he must necessarily sit. In both cases, then, there is a necessity; in the latter, that the person sits; in the former, that the opinion concerning him is true: but the person doth not sit, because the opinion of his sitting is true, but the opinion is rather true because the action of his being seated was antecedent in time. Thus, though the truth of the opinion may be the effect of the person taking a seat, there is, nevertheless, a necessity common to both. The same method of reasoning, I think, should be employed with regard to the prescience of God, and future contingencies; for, allowing it to be true that events are foreseen because they are to happen, and that they do not befall because they are foreseen, it is still necessary that what is to happen must be foreseen by God, and that what is foreseen must take place. This then is of itself sufficient to destroy all idea of human liberty.”</p>

And like as a pilgrim, who goeth upon a road on which he never was before, thinketh every house he seeth afar off to be an inn, and, not finding it so, directeth his trust to the next, and thus from house to house until he reacheth the inn; in like manner our soul, presently as she entereth the new and untravelled road of this life, turneth her eyes to the goal of her supreme good; and therefore whatever thing she seeth that seemeth to have some good in it, she believeth to be that. And because her knowledge at first is imperfect, not being experienced nor trained, small goods seem great, and therefore with them beginneth her desire. Hence we see children desire exceedingly an apple; and then, going farther, desire a little bird; and farther still, a beautiful dress; and then a horse; and then a woman; and then wealth not very great, and then greater, and then greater still.

					<p>The dissension and war between the Emperor Frederick the Second and Pope Gregory the Ninth. Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> 3, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Empire and the Papacy were now to meet in their last mortal and implacable strife; the two first acts of this tremendous drama, separated by an interval of many years, were to be developed during the pontificate of a prelate who ascended the throne of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter at the age of eighty. Nor was this strife for any specific point in dispute, like the right of investiture, but avowedly for supremacy on one side, which hardly deigned to call itself independence; for independence, on the other, which remotely at least aspired after supremacy. Caesar would bear no superior, the successor of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter no equal. The contest could not have begun under men more strongly contrasted, or more determinedly oppugnant in character, than Gregory the Ninth and Frederick the Second. Gregory retained the ambition, the vigor, almost the activity of youth, with the stubborn obstinacy, and something of the irritable petulance, of old age. He was still master of all his powerful faculties; his knowledge of affairs, of mankind, of the peculiar interests of almost all the nations in Christendom, acquired by long employment in the most important negotiations both by Innocent the Third and by Honorius the Third; eloquence which his own age compared to that of Tully; profound erudition in that learning which, in the medieval churchman, commanded the highest admiration. No one was his superior in the science of the canon law; the Decretals, to which he afterwards gave a more full and authoritative form, were at his command, and they were to him as much the law of God as the Gospels themselves, or the primary principles of morality. The jealous reverence and attachment of a great lawyer to his science strengthened the lofty pretensions of the churchman.</p>
						<p>“Frederick the Second, with many of the noblest qualities which could captivate the admiration of his own age, in some respects might appear misplaced, and by many centuries prematurely born. Frederick having crowded into his youth adventures, perils, successes, almost unparalleled in history, was now only expanding into the prime of manhood. A parentless orphan, he had struggled upward into the actual reigning monarch of his hereditary Sicily; he was even then rising above the yoke of the turbulent magnates of his realm, and the depressing tutelage of the Papal See; he had crossed the Alps a boyish adventurer, and won so much through his own valor and daring that he might well ascribe to himself his conquest, the kingdom of Germany, the imperial crown; he was in undisputed possession of the Empire, with all its rights in Northern Italy; King of Apulia, Sicily, and Jerusalem. He was beginning to be at once the Magnificent Sovereign, the knight, the poet, the lawgiver, the patron of arts, letters, and science; the Magnificent Sovereign, now holding his court in one of the old barbaric and feudal cities of Germany among the proud and turbulent princes of the Empire, more often on the sunny shores of Naples or Palermo, in southern and almost Oriental luxury; the gallant Knight and troubadour Poet, not forbidding himself those amorous indulgences which were the reward of chivalrous valor and of the ‘gay science’; the Lawgiver, whose farseeing wisdom seemed to anticipate some of those views of equal justice, of the advantages of commerce, of the cultivation of the arts of peace, beyond all the toleration of adverse religions, which even in a more dutiful son of the Church would doubtless have seemed godless indifference. Frederick must appear before us in the course of our history in the full development of all these shades of character; but besides all this, Frederick’s views of the temporal sovereignty were as imperious and autocratic as those of the haughtiest churchman of the spiritual supremacy. The ban of the Empire ought to be at least equally awful with that of the Church; disloyalty to the Emperor was as heinous a sin as infidelity to the head of Christendom; the independence of the Lombard republics was as a great and punishable political heresy. Even in Rome itself, as head of the Roman Empire, Frederick aspired to a supremacy which was not less unlimited because vague and undefined, and irreconcilable with that of the Supreme Pontiff. If ever Emperor might be tempted by the vision of a vast hereditary monarchy to be perpetuated in his house, the princely house of Hohenstaufen, it was Frederick. He had heirs of his greatness; his eldest son was King of the Romans; from his loins might yet spring an inexhaustible race of princes; the failure of his imperial line was his last fear. The character of the man seemed formed to achieve and to maintain this vast design; he was at once terrible and popular, courteous, generous, placable to his foes; yet there was a depth of cruelty in the heart of Frederick towards revolted subjects, which made him look on the atrocities of his allies, Eccelin di Romano, and the Salinguerras, but as legitimate means to quell insolent and stubborn rebellion.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“It is impossible to conceive a contrast more strong or more irreconcilable than the octogenarian Gregory, in his cloister palace, in his conclave of stern ascetics, with all but severe imprisonment within conventual walls, completely monastic in manners, habits, views, in corporate spirit, in celibacy, in rigid seclusion from the rest of mankind, in the conscientious determination to enslave, if possible, all Christendom to its inviolable unity of faith, and to the least possible latitude of discipline; and the gay and yet youthful Frederick, with his mingled assemblage of knights and ladies, of Christians, Jews, and Mohammedans, of poets and men of science, met, as it were, to enjoy and minister to enjoyment⁠—to cultivate the pure intellect⁠—where, if not the restraints of religion, at least the awful authority of churchmen was examined with freedom, sometimes ridiculed with sportive wit.”</p>

					<p>Currado (Conrad) da Palazzo of Brescia; Gherardo da Camino of Treviso; and Guido da Castello of Reggio. Of these three the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Ottimo</i> thus speaks:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Messer Currado was laden with honor during his life, delighted in a fine retinue, and in political life in the government of cities, in which he acquired much praise and fame.</p>
						<p>“Messer Guido was assiduous in honoring men of worth, who passed on their way to France, and furnished many with horses and arms, who came hitherward from France. To all who had honorably consumed their property, and returned more poorly furnished than became them, he gave, without hope of return, horses, arms, and money.</p>
						<p>“Messer Gherardo da Camino delighted not in one, but in all noble things, keeping constantly at home.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>He farther says, that his fame was so great in France that he was there spoken of as the “simple Lombard,” just as, “when one says the City, and no more, one means Rome.” Benvenuto da Imola says that all Italians were called Lombards by the French.

His character is thus drawn by Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> 7, and sufficiently explains why Dante calls him “the good Barbarossa”:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Frederick was a prince of intrepid valor, consummate prudence, unmeasured ambition, justice which hardened into severity, the ferocity of a barbarian somewhat tempered with a high chivalrous gallantry; above all, with a strength of character which subjugated alike the great temporal and ecclesiastical princes of Germany; and was prepared to assert the Imperial rights in Italy to the utmost. Of the constitutional rights of the Emperor, of his unlimited supremacy, his absolute independence of, his temporal superiority over, all other powers, even that of the Pope, Frederick proclaimed the loftiest notions. He was to the Empire what Hildebrand and Innocent were to the Popedom. His power was of God alone; to assert that it was bestowed by the successor of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter was a lie, and directly contrary to the doctrine of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter.”</p>

Meantime the maidens wept continually, not knowing what to do, and not having bread to eat; and their father became more and more desperate. When Nicholas heard of this, he thought it a shame that such a thing should happen in a Christian land; therefore one night, when the maidens were asleep, and their father alone sat watching and weeping, he took a handful of gold, and, tying it up in a handkerchief, he repaired to the dwelling of the poor man. He considered how he might bestow it without making himself known, and, while he stood irresolute, the moon coming from behind a cloud showed him a window open; so he threw it in, and it fell at the feet of the father, who, when he found it, returned thanks, and with it he portioned his eldest daughter. A second time Nicholas provided a similar sum, and again he threw it in by night; and with it the nobleman married his second daughter. But he greatly desired to know who it was that came to his aid; therefore he determined to watch, and when the good saint came for the third time, and prepared to throw in the third portion, he was discovered, for the nobleman seized him by the skirt of his robe, and flung himself at his feet, saying, O Nicholas! servant of God! why seek to hide thyself?’ and he kissed his feet and his hands. But Nicholas made him promise that he would tell no man. And many other charitable works did Nicholas perform in his native city.”</p>

					<p>If we knew from what old chronicle, or from what Professor of the Rue du Fouarre, Dante derived his knowledge of French history, we might possibly make plain the rather difficult passage which begins with this line.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“In Philip the Fair the gallantry of the French temperament broke out on rare occasions; his first Flemish campaigns were conducted with bravery and skill, but Philip ever preferred the subtle negotiation, the slow and wily encroachment; till his enemies were, if not in his power, at least at great disadvantage, he did not venture on the usurpation or invasion. In the slow systematic pursuit of his object he was utterly without scruple, without remorse. He was not so much cruel as altogether obtuse to human suffering, if necessary to the prosecution of his schemes; not so much rapacious as, finding money indispensable to his aggrandizement, seeking money by means of which he hardly seemed to discern the injustice or the folly. Never was man or monarch so intensely selfish as Philip the Fair: his own power was his ultimate scope; he extended so enormously the royal prerogative, the influence of France, because he was King of France. His rapacity, which persecuted the Templars, his vindictiveness, which warred on Boniface after death as through life, was this selfishness in other forms.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“From this you can perceive the fatality there was in this family from its beginning to its end, to the disadvantage of the Carlovingians. And moreover, how ignorant the Italian poet Dante was, when in his book entitled Purgatory he says that our Hugh Capet was the son of a butcher. Which word, once written erroneously and carelessly by him, has so crept into the heads of some simpletons, that many who never investigated the antiquities of our France have fallen into this same heresy. François de Villon, more studious of taverns and alehouses than of good books, says in some part of his works,</p>
						<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem" xml:lang="fr">
							<p>
								<span>“Si feusse les hoirs de Capet</span>
								<br/>
								<span>Qui fut extrait de boucherie.”</span>
							</p>
						</blockquote>
						<p class="continued">And since then Agrippa Alamanni, in his book on the Vanity of Science, chapter “Of Nobility,” on this first ignorance declares impudently against the genealogy of our Capet. If Dante thought that Hugh the Great, Capet’s father, was a butcher, he was not a clever man. But if he used this expression figuratively, as I am willing to believe, those who cling to the shell of the word are greater blockheads still.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“This passage of Dante being read and explained by Luigi Alamanni, an Italian, before Francis the First of that name, he was indignant at the imposture, and commanded it to be stricken out. He was even excited to interdict the reading of the book in his kingdom. But for my part, in order to exculpate this author, I wish to say that under the name of Butcher he meant that Capet was son of a great and valiant warrior.⁠ ⁠… If Dante understood it thus, I forgive him; if otherwise, he was a very ignorant poet.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Benvenuto says that the name of Capet comes from the fact that Hugh, in playing with his companions in boyhood, “was in the habit of pulling off their caps and running away with them.” Ducange repeats this story from an old chronicle, and gives also another and more probable origin of the name, as coming from the hood or cowl which Hugh was in the habit of wearing.</p>
					<p>The belief that the family descended from a butcher was current in Italy in Dante’s time. Villani, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 3, says:⁠—</p>

					<p>Endeavoring to escape to Sicily after his defeat at Tagliacozzo, he was carried to Naples and imprisoned in the Castel deir Uovo. “Christendom heard with horror,” says Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> 3, “that the royal brother of <abbr>St.</abbr> Louis, that the champion of the Church, after a mock trial, by the sentence of one judge, Robert di Lavena⁠—after an unanswerable pleading by Guido de Suzaria, a famous jurist⁠—had condemned the last heir of the Swabian house⁠—a rival king who had fought gallantly for his hereditary throne⁠—to be executed as a felon and a rebel on a public scaffold. So little did Conradin dread his fate, that, when his doom was announced, he was playing at chess with Frederick of Austria. ‘Slave,’ said Conradin to Robert of Bari, who read the fatal sentence, ‘do you dare to condemn as a criminal the son and heir of kings? Knows not your master that he is my equal, not my judge?’ He added, ‘I am a mortal, and must die; yet ask the kings of the earth if a prince be criminal for seeking to win back the heritage of his ancestors. But if there be no pardon for me, spare, at least, my faithful companions; or if they must die, strike me first, that I may not behold their death.’ They died devoutly, nobly. Every circumstance aggravated the abhorrence; it was said⁠—perhaps it was the invention of that abhorrence⁠—that Robert of Flanders, the brother of Charles, struck dead the judge who had presumed to read the iniquitous sentence. When Conradin knelt, with uplifted hands, awaiting the blow of the executioner, he uttered these last words, ‘O my mother! how deep will be thy sorrow at the news of this day!’ Even the followers of Charles could hardly restrain their pity and indignation. With Conradin died his young and valiant friend, Frederick of Austria, the two Lancias, two of the noble house of Donaticcio of Pisa. The inexorable Charles would not permit them to be buried in consecrated ground.” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-916" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

Now it seems to me very natural that the kings of the Franks, having to choose a symbol to which the name of armorial bearings has since been given, should take in its composition a beautiful and remarkable flower, which they had before their eyes, and that they should name it, from the place where it grew in abundance, <em>flower of the river Lys</em>.”</p>

					<p>This passage alludes to the seizure and imprisonment of Pope Boniface the Eighth by the troops of Philip the Fair at Alagna or Anagni, in 1303. Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> 9, thus describes the event:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“On a sudden, on the 7th September (the 8th was the day for the publication of the Bull), the peaceful streets of Anagni were disturbed. The Pope and the Cardinals, who were all assembled around him, were startled with the trampling of armed horse, and the terrible cry, which ran like wildfire through the city, ‘Death to Pope Boniface! Long live the King of France!’ Sciarra Colonna, at the head of three hundred horsemen, the Barons of Cercano and Supino, and some others, the sons of Master Massio of Anagni, were marching in furious haste, with the banner of the king of France displayed. The ungrateful citizens of Anagni, forgetful of their pride in their holy compatriot, of the honor and advantage to their town from the splendor and wealth of the Papal residence, received them with rebellious and acclaiming shouts.</p>
						<p>“The bell of the city, indeed, had tolled at the first alarm; the burghers had assembled; they had chosen their commander; but that commander, whom they ignorantly or treacherously chose, was Arnulf, a deadly enemy of the Pope. The banner of the Church was unfolded against the Pope by the captain of the people of Anagni. The first attack was on the palace of the Pope on that of the Marquis Gaetani, his nephew, and those of three Cardinals, the special partisans of Boniface. The houses of the Pope and of his nephew made some resistance. The doors of those of the Cardinals were beaten down, the treasures ransacked and carried off; the Cardinals themselves fled from the backs of the houses through the common sewer. Then arrived, but not to the rescue, Arnulf, the Captain of the People; he had perhaps been suborned by Reginald of Supino. With him were the sons of Chiton, whose father was pining in the dungeons of Boniface. Instead of resisting, they joined the attack on the palace of the Pope’s nephew and his own. The Pope and his nephew implored a truce; it was granted for eight hours. This time the Pope employed in endeavoring to stir up the people to his defence; the people coldly answered, that they were under the command of their Captain. The Pope demanded the terms of the conspirators. ‘If the Pope would save his life, let him instantly restore the Colonna Cardinals to their dignity, and reinstate the whole house in their honors and possessions; after this restoration the Pope must abdicate, and leave his body at the disposal of Sciarra.’ The Pope groaned in the depths of his heart. ‘The word is spoken.’ Again the assailants thundered at the gates of the palace; still there was obstinate resistance. The principal church of Anagni, that of Santa Maria, protected the Pope’s palace. Sciarra Colonna’s lawless band set fire to the gates; the church was crowded with clergy and laity and traders who had brought their precious wares into the sacred building. They were plundered with such rapacity that not a man escaped with a farthing.</p>
						<p>“The Marquis found himself compelled to surrender, on the condition that his own life, that of his family and of his servants, should be spared. At these sad tidings the Pope wept bitterly. The Pope was alone; from the first the Cardinals, some from treachery, some from cowardice, had fled on all sides, even his most familiar friends: they had crept into the most ignoble hiding-places. The aged Pontiff alone lost not his self-command. He had declared himself ready to perish in his glorious cause; he determined to fall with dignity. ‘If I am betrayed like Christ, I am ready to die like Christ.’ He put on the stole of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter, the imperial crown was on his head, the keys of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter in one hand and the cross in the other: he took his seat on the Papal throne, and, like the Roman Senators of old, awaited the approach of the Gaul.</p>
						<p>“But the pride and cruelty of Boniface had raised and infixed deep in the hearts of men passions which acknowledged no awe of age, of intrepidity, or religious majesty. In William of Nogaret the blood or his Tolosan ancestors, in Colonna, the wrongs, the degradation, the beggary, the exile of all his house, had extinguished every feeling but revenge. They insulted him with contumelious reproaches; they menaced his life. The Pope answered not a word. They insisted that he should at once abdicate the Papacy. ‘Behold my neck, behold my head,’ was the only reply. But fiercer words passed between the Pope and William of Nogaret. Nogaret threatened to drag him before the Council of Lyons, where he should be deposed from the Papacy. ‘Shall I suffer myself to be degraded and deposed by Paterins like thee, whose fathers were righteously burned as Paterins?’ William turned fiery red, with shame thought the partisans of Boniface, more likely with wrath. Sciarra, it was said, would have slain him outright; he was prevented by some of his own followers, even by Nogaret. ‘Wretched Pope, even at this distance the goodness of my Lord the King guards thy life.’</p>
						<p>“He was placed under close custody, not one of his own attendants permitted to approach him. Worse indignities awaited him. He was set on a vicious horse, with his face to the tail, and so led through the town to his place of imprisonment. The palaces of the Pope and of his nephew were plundered; so vast was the wealth, that the annual revenues of all the kings in the world would not have been equal to the treasures found and carried off by Sciarra’s freebooting soldiers. His very private chamber was ransacked; nothing left but bare walls.</p>
						<p>“At length the people of Anagni could no longer bear the insult and the sufferings heaped upon their illustrious and holy fellow-citizen. They rose in irresistible insurrection, drove out the soldiers by whom they had been overawed, now gorged with plunder, and doubtless not unwilling to withdraw. The Pope was rescued, and led out into the street, where the old man addressed a few words to the people: ‘Good men and women, ye see how mine enemies have come upon me, and plundered my goods, those of the Church and of the poor. Not a morsel of bread have I eaten, not a drop have I drunk, since my capture. I am almost dead with hunger. If any good woman will give me a piece of bread and a cup of wine, if she has no wine, a little water, I will absolve her, and any one who will give me their alms, from all their sins.’ The compassionate rabble burst into a cry, ‘Long life to the Pope!’ They carried him back to his naked palace. They crowded, the women especially, with provisions, bread, meat, water, and wine. They could not find a single vessel: they poured a supply of water into a chest. The Pope proclaimed a general absolution to all except the plunderers of his palace. He even declared that he wished to be at peace with the Colonnas and all his enemies. This perhaps was to disguise his intention of retiring, as soon as he could, to Rome.</p>
						<p>“The Romans had heard with indignation the sacrilegious attack on the person of the Supreme Pontiff. Four hundred horse under Matteo and Gaetano Orsini were sent to conduct him to the city. He entered it almost in triumph; the populace welcomed him with every demonstration of joy. But the awe of his greatness was gone; the spell of his dominion over the minds of men was broken. His overweening haughtiness and domination had made him many enemies in the Sacred College, the gold of France had made him more. This general revolt is his severest condemnation. Among his first enemies was the Cardinal Napoleon Orsini. Orsini had followed the triumphal entrance of the Pope. Boniface, to show that he desired to reconcile himself with all, courteously invited him to his table. The Orsini coldly answered, ‘that he must receive the Colonna Cardinals into his favor; he must not now disown what had been wrung from him by compulsion.’ ‘I will pardon them,’ said Boniface, ‘but the mercy of the Pope is not to be from compulsion.’ He found himself again a prisoner.</p>
						<p>“This last mortification crushed the bodily, if not the mental strength of the Pope. Among the Ghibellines terrible stories were bruited abroad of his death. In an access of fury, either from poison or wounded pride, he sat gnawing the top of his staff, and at length either beat out his own brains against the wall, or smothered himself (a strange notion!) with his own pillows. More friendly, probably more trustworthy, accounts describe him as sadly but quietly breathing his last, surrounded by eight Cardinals, having confessed the faith and received the consoling offices of the Church. The Cardinal-Poet anticipates his mild sentence from the Divine Judge.</p>
						<p>“The religious mind of Christendom was at once perplexed and horror-stricken by this act of sacrilegious violence on the person of the Supreme Pontiff; it shocked some even of the sternest Ghibellines. Dante, who brands the pride, the avarice, the treachery of Boniface in his most terrible words, and has consigned him to the direst doom, (though it is true that his alliance with the French, with Charles of Valois, by whom the poet had been driven into exile, was among the deepest causes of his hatred to Boniface,) nevertheless expresses the almost universal feeling. Christendom shuddered to behold the Fleur-de-lis enter into Anagni, and Christ again captive in his Vicar, the mockery, the gall and vinegar, the crucifixion between living robbers, the insolent and sacrilegious cruelty of the second Pilate.”</p>

						<p>“After Don Quixote had satisfied his hunger, he took up an handful of acorns, and, looking on them attentively, gave utterance to expressions like these:⁠—</p>
						<p>“ ‘Happy times, and happy ages! those to which the ancients gave the name of golden, not because gold (which, in this our iron age, is so much esteemed) was to be had, in that fortunate period, without toil and labor; but because they who then lived were ignorant of these two words, Meum and Tuum. In that age of innocence, all things were in common; no one needed to take any other pains for his ordinary sustenance, than to lift up his hand and take it from the sturdy oaks, which stood inviting him liberally to taste of their sweet and relishing fruit. The limpid fountains, and running streams, offered them, in magnificent abundance, their delicious and transparent waters. In the clefts of rocks, and in the hollow of trees, did the industrious and provident bees form their commonwealths, offering to every hand, without usury, the fertile produce of their most delicious toil. The stout cork-trees, without any other inducement than that of their own courtesy, divested themselves of their light and expanded bark, with which men began to cover their houses, supported by rough poles, only for a defence against the inclemency of the seasons. All then was peace, all amity, all concord. As yet the heavy coulter of the crooked plough had not dared to force open, and search into, the tender bowels of our first mother, who unconstrained offered, from every part of her fertile and spacious bosom, whatever might feed, sustain, and delight those her children, who then had her in possession. Then did the simple and beauteous young shepherdesses trip it from dale to dale, and from hill to hill, their tresses sometimes plaited, sometimes loosely flowing, with no more clothing than was necessary modestly to cover what modesty has always required to be concealed; nor were there ornaments like those nowadays in fashion, to which the Tyrian purple and the so-many-ways martyred silk give a value; but composed of green dock-leaves and ivy interwoven; with which, perhaps, they went as splendidly and elegantly decked as our court-ladies do now, with all those rare and foreign inventions which idle curiosity hath taught them. Then were the amorous conceptions of the soul clothed in simple and sincere expressions, in the same way and manner they were conceived, without seeking so much depreciate, confound, and perartificial phrases to set them off. Nor secute her, not daring then to disturb as yet were fraud, deceit, and malice or offend her. As yet the judge did intermixed with truth and plain-dealnot make his own will the measure of ing. Justice kept within her proper justice; for then there was neither bounds; favor and interest, which now cause nor person to be judged.’ ”</p>

						<p>“There was a certain woman that dwelt beyond Jordan; her name was Mary; her father was Eleazar, of the village Bethezub, which signifies the house of Hyssop. She was eminent for her family and her wealth, and had fled away to Jerusalem with the rest of the multitude, and was with them besieged therein at this time. The other effects of this woman had been already seized upon, such I mean as she had brought with her out of Perea, and removed to the city. What she had treasured up besides, as also what food she had contrived to save, had been also carried off by the rapacious guards, who came every day running into her house for that purpose. This put the poor woman into a very great passion, and by the frequent reproaches and imprecations she cast at these rapacious villains, she had provoked them to anger against her; but none of them, either out of the indignation she had raised against herself, or out of commiseration of her case, would take away her life. And if she found any food, she perceived her labors were for others and not for herself; and it was now become impossible for her any way to find any more food, while the famine pierced through her very bowels and marrow, when also her passion was fired to a degree beyond the famine itself. Nor did she consult with anything but with her passion and the necessity she was in. She then attempted a most unnatural thing, and, snatching up her son who was a child sucking at her breast, she said, ‘O thou miserable infant! For whom shall I preserve thee in this war, this famine, and this sedition? As to the war with the Romans, if they preserve our lives, we must be slaves. This famine also will destroy us, even before that slavery comes upon us. Yet are these seditious rogues more terrible than both the other. Come on, be thou my food, and be thou a fury to these seditious varlets, and a byword to the world; which is all that is now wanting to complete the calamities of the Jews.’ As soon as she had said this, she slew her son, and then roasted him, and ate the one half of him, and kept the other half by her concealed. Upon this the seditious came in presently, and, smelling the horrid scent of this food, they threatened her that they would cut her throat immediately, if she did not show them what food she had gotten ready. She replied, that she had saved a very fine portion of it for them; and withal uncovered what was left of her son. Hereupon they were seized with a horror and amazement of mind, and stood astonished at the sight, when she said to them: ‘This is mine own son, and what hath been done was mine own doing. Come, eat of this food; for I have eaten of it myself. Do not you pretend to be either more tender than a woman, or more compassionate than a mother. But if you be so scrupulous, and do abominate this my sacrifice, as I have eaten the one half, let the rest be reserved for me also.’ After which those men went out trembling, being never so much affrighted at anything as they were at this, and with some difficulty they left the rest of that meat to the mother. Upon which the whole city was full of this horrid action immediately; and while everybody laid this miserable case before their own eyes, they trembled as if this unheard of action had been done by themselves. So those that were thus distressed by the famine were very desirous to die, and those already dead were esteemed happy, because they had not lived long enough either to hear or to see such miseries.”</p>

					<p>Sacchetti, the Italian novelist of the fourteenth century, severely criticises the fashions of the Florentines, and their sudden changes, which he says it would take a whole volume of his stories to enumerate.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The young Florentine girls, who used to dress so modestly, have now changed the fashion of their hoods to resemble courtesans, and thus attired they move about laced up to the throat, with all sorts of animals hanging as ornaments about their necks. Their sleeves, or rather their sacks, as they should be called⁠—was there ever so useless and pernicious a fashion! Can any of them reach a glass or take a morsel from the table without dirtying herself or the cloth by the things she knocks down? And thus do the young men, and worse; and such sleeves are made even for sucking babes. The women go about in hoods and cloaks; most of the young men without cloaks, in long, flowing hair, and if they throw off their breeches, which from their smallness may easily be done, all is off, for they literally stick their posteriors into a pair of socks and expend a yard of cloth on their wristbands, while more stuff is put into a glove than a cloak-hood. However, I am comforted by one thing, and that is, that all now have begun to put their feet in chains, perhaps as a penance for the many vain things they are guilty of; for we are but a day in this world, and in that day the fashion is changed a thousand times: all seek liberty, yet all deprive themselves of it: God has made our feet free, and many with long pointed toes to their shoes can scarcely walk: he has supplied the legs with hinges, and many have so bound them up with close lacing that they can scarcely sit: the bust is tightly bandaged up; the arms trail their drapery along; the throat is rolled in a capuchin; the head so loaded and bound round with caps over the hair that it appears as though it were sawed off. And thus I might go on forever discoursing of female absurdities, commencing with the immeasurable trains at their feet, and proceeding regularly upwards to the head, with which they may always be seen occupied in their chambers; some curling, some smoothing, and some whitening it, so that they often kill themselves with colds caught in these vain occupations.”</p>

Forli was placed under interdict for harboring the exiles; the goods of the citizens were confiscated for the benefit of the Pope.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Its circular form, and being in the centre of a volcanic district, hashed to its being regarded as an extinct crater; but that hypothesis can scarcely be admitted when the great extent of the lake is considered.

The ground is cultivated in many parts down to the water’s edge, but the laborers dare not sleep for a single night during the summer or autumn on the plains where they work by day; and a large tract of beautiful and productive country is reduced to a perfect solitude by this invisible calamity. Nothing can be more striking than the appearance of the lake, without a single sail upon its waters, and with scarcely a human habitation within sight of Bolsena; and nothing perhaps can give the traveller who visits Italy for the first time a more impressive idea of the effects of malaria.”</p>

					<p>Corso Donati, the brother of Forese who is here speaking, and into whose mouth nothing but Ghibelline wrath could have put these words. Corso was the leader of the Neri in Florence, and a partisan of Charles de Valois. His death is recorded by Villani, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 96, and is thus described by Napier, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Florentine History</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 407:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The popularity of Corso was now thoroughly undermined, and the priors, after sounding the Campana for a general assembly of the armed citizens, laid a formal accusation before the Podestà Piero Branca d’ Agobbio against him for conspiring to overthrow the liberties of his country, and endeavoring to make himself Tyrant of Florence: he was immediately cited to appear, and, not complying, from a reasonable distrust of his judges, was within one hour, against all legal forms, condemned to lose his head, as a rebel and traitor to the commonwealth.</p>
						<p>“Not willing to allow the culprit more time for an armed resistance than had been given for legal vindication, the Scignory, preceded by the Gonfalonier of justice, and followed by the Podestà, the captain of the people, and the executor⁠—all attended by their guards and officers⁠—issued from the palace; and with the whole civic force marshalled in companies, with banners flying, moved forward to execute an illegal sentence against a single citizen, who nevertheless stood undaunted on his defence.</p>
						<p>“Corso, on first hearing of the prosecution, had hastily barricaded all the approaches to his palace, but, disabled by the gout, could only direct the necessary operations from his bed; yet thus helpless, thus abandoned by all but his own immediate friends and vassals; suddenly condemned to death; encompassed by the bitterest foes, with the whole force of the republic banded against him, he never cowered for an instant, but courageously determined to resist, until succored by Uguccione della Faggiola, to whom he had sent for aid. This attack continued during the greater part of the day, and generally with advantage to the Donati, for the people were not unanimous, and many fought unwillingly, so that, if the Rossi, Bardi, and other friends had joined, and Uguccioni’s forces arrived, it would have gone hard with the citizens. The former were intimidated, the latter turned back on hearing how matters stood; and then only did Corso’s adherents lose heart and slink from the barricades, while the townsmen pursued their advantage by breaking down a garden wall opposite the Stinche prisons and taking their enemy in the rear. This completed the disaster, and Corso, seing no chance remaining, fled towards the Casentino; but, being overtaken by some Catalonian troopers in the Florentine service, he was led back a prisoner from Rovezzano. After vainly endeavoring to bribe them, unable to support the indignity of a public execution at the hands of his enemies, he let himself fall from his horse, and, receiving several stabs in the neck and flank from the Catalan lances, his body was left bleeding on the road, until the monks of San Salvi removed it to their convent, where he was interred next morning with the greatest privacy. Thus perished Corso Donati, ‘the wisest and most worthy knight of his time; the best speaker, the most experienced statesman; the most renowned, the boldest, and most enterprising nobleman in Italy: he was handsome in person and of the most gracious manners, but very worldly, and caused infinite disturbance in Florence on account of his ambition.’⁠ ⁠…<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2105" id="noteref-2105" epub:type="noteref">2105</a> ‘People now began to repose, and his unhappy death was often and variously discussed, according to the feelings of friendship or enmity that moved the speaker; but in truth, his life was dangerous, and his death reprehensible. He was a knight of great mind and name, gentle in manners as in blood; of a fine figure even in his old age, with a beautitul countenance, delicate features, and a fair complexion; pleasing, wise; and an eloquent speaker. His attention was ever fixed on important things; he was intimate with all the great and noble, had an extensive influence, and was famous throughout Italy. He was an enemy of the middle classes and their supporters, beloved by the troops, but full of malicious thoughts, wicked, and artful. He was thus basely murdered by a foreign soldier, and his fellow-citizens well knew the man, for he was instantly conveyed away: those who ordered his death were Rosso della Tosa and Pazzino de’ Pazzi, as is commonly said by all; and some bless him and some the contrary. Many believe that the two said knights killed him, and I, wishing to ascertain the truth, inquired diligently, and found what I have said to be true.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2106" id="noteref-2106" epub:type="noteref">2106</a> Such is the character of Corso Donati, which has come down to us from two authors who must have been personally acquainted with this distinguished chief, but opposed to each other in the general politics of their country.”</p>

Perhaps no two passages could better show the difference between Dante and Milton, than this canto and “Plato’s Archetypal Man,” which in Leigh Hunt’s translation runs as follows:⁠—</p>

						<p>“In the first place, the spirit within nourishes the heavens, the earth, and watery plains, the moon’s enlightened orb, and the Titanian stars; and the mind, diffused through all the members, actuates the whole frame, and mingles with the vast body of the universe. Thence the race of men and beasts, the vital principles of the flying kind, and the monsters which the ocean breeds under its smooth plain. These principles have the active force of fire, and are of a heavenly original, so far as they are not clogged by noxious bodies, blunted by earthborn limbs and dying members. Hence they fear and desire, grieve and rejoice; and, shut up in darkness and a gloomy prison, lose sight of their native skies. Even when with the last beams of light their life is gone, yet not every ill, nor all corporeal stains, are quite removed from the unhappy beings; and it is absolutely necessary that many imperfections which have long been joined to the soul should be in marvellous ways increased and riveted therein. Therefore are they afflicted with punishments, and pay the penalties of their former ills. Some, hung on high, are spread out to the empty winds; in others, the guilt not done away is washed out in a vast watery abyss, or burned away in fire. We each endure his own manes, thence are we conveyed along the spacious Elysium, and we, the happy few, possess the fields of bliss; till length of time, after the fixed period is elapsed, hath done away the inherent stain, and hath left the pure celestial reason, and the fiery energy of the simple spirit.”</p>

					<p>Arnaud Daniel, the Troubadour of the thirteenth century, whom Dante lauds so highly, and whom Petrarca calls “the Grand Master of Love,” was born of a noble family at the castle of Ribeyrac in Périgord. Millot, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Histoire Littéraire des Troubadours</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 479, says of him:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In all ages there have been false reputations, founded on some individual judgment, whose authority has prevailed without examination, until at last criticism discusses, the truth penetrates, and the phantom of prejudice vanishes. Such has been the reputation of Arnaud Daniel.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Raynouard confirms this judgment, and says that, “in reading the works of this Troubadour, it is difficult to conceive the causes of the great celebrity he enjoyed during his life.”</p>
					<p>Arnaud Daniel was the inventor of the <em>Sestina</em>, a song of six stanzas of six lines each, with the same rhymes repeated in all, though arranged in different and intricate order, which must be seen to be understood. He was also author of the metrical romance of <i xml:lang="it">Lancillotto</i>, or Launcelot of the Lake, to which Dante doubtless refers in his expression <i xml:lang="it">prose di romanzi</i>, or proses of romance. The following anecdote is from the old Provençal authority, quoted both by Millot and Raynouard, and is thus translated by Miss Costello, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Early Poetry of France</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 37:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Arnaud visited the court of Richard Coeur de Lion in England, and encountered there a jongleur, who defied him to a trial of skill, and boasted of being able to make more difficult rhymes than Arnaud, a proficiency on which he chiefly prided himself. He accepted the challenge, and the two poets separated, and retired to their respective chambers to prepare for the contest. The Muse of Arnaud was not propitious, and he vainly endeavored to string two rhymes together. His rival, on the other hand, quickly caught the inspiration. The king had allowed ten days as the term of preparation, five for composition, and the remainder for learning it by heart to sing before the court. On the third day the jongleur declared that he had finished his poem, and was ready to recite it, but Arnaud replied that he had not yet thought of his. It was the jongleur’s custom to repeat his verses out loud every day, in order to learn them better, and Arnaud, who was in vain endeavoring to devise some means to save himself from the mockery of the court at being outdone in this contest, happened to overhear the jongleur singing. He went to his door and listened, and succeeded in retaining the words and the air. On the day appointed they both appeared before the king. Arnaud desired to be allowed to sing first, and immediately gave the song which the jongleur had composed. The latter, stupefied with astonishment, could only exclaim: ‘It is my song, it is my song.’ ‘Impossible!’ cried the king; but the jongleur, persisting, requested Richard to interrogate Arnaud, who would not dare, he said, to deny it. Daniel confessed the fact, and related the manner in which the affair had been conducted, which amused Richard far more than the song itself. The stakes of the wager were restored to each, and the king loaded them both with presents.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>According to Nostrodamus, Arnaud died about 1189. There is no other reason for making him speak in Provençal than the evident delight which Dante took in the sound of the words, and the peculiar flavor they give to the close of the canto. Raynouard says that the writings of none of the Troubadours have been so disfigured by copyists as those of Arnaud. This would seem to be true of the very lines which Dante writes for him; as there are at least seven different readings of them.</p>
					<p>Here Venturi has again the indiscretion to say that Arnaud answers Dante in “a kind of <em>lingua-franca</em>, part Provençal and part Catalan, joining together the perfidious French with the vile Spanish, perhaps to show that Arnaud was a clever speaker of the two.” And again Biagioli suppresses him with “that unbridled beast of a Venturi,” and this “most potent argument of his presumptuous ignorance and impertinence.” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-1052" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The mind can walk beyond the sight of the eye, and, though in a cloud, can lift us into heaven while we live. Meditation is the soul’s perspective glass, whereby, in her long remove, she discerneth God as if he were nearer hand. I persuade no man to make it his whole life’s business. We have bodies as well as souls. And even this world, while we are in it, ought somewhat to be cared for. As those states are likely to flourish, where execution follows sound advisements, so is man, when contemplation is seconded by action. Contemplation generates; action propagates. Without the first, the latter is defective. Without the last, the first is but abortive and embryous. Saint Bernard compares contemplation to Rachel, which was the more fair; but action to Leah, which was the more fruitful. I will neither always be busy and doing, nor ever shut up in nothing but thoughts. Yet that which some would call idleness, I will call the sweetest part of my life, and that is, my thinking.”</p>

						<p>“This vision of Rachel and Leah has been always, and with unquestionable truth, received as a type of the Active and Contemplative life, and as an introduction to the two divisions of the Paradise which Dante is about to enter. Therefore the unwearied spirit of the Countess Matilda is understood to represent the Active life, which forms the felicity of Earth; and the spirit of Beatrice the Contemplative life, which forms the felicity of Heaven. This interpretation appears at first straightforward and certain; but it has missed count of exactly the most important fact in the two passages which we have to explain. Observe: Leah gathers the flowers to decorate <em>herself</em>, and delights in <em>her own</em> Labor. Rachel sits silent, contemplating herself, and delights in <em>her own</em> Image. These are the types of the Unglorified Active and Contemplative powers of Man. But Beatrice and Matilda are the same powers, glorified. And how are they glorified? Leah took delight in her own labor; but Matilda, <i xml:lang="la">in operibus manuum Tuarum</i>⁠—<em>in God’s labor</em>: Rachel, in the sight of her own face; Beatrice, in the sight of <em>God’s face</em>.”</p>

						<p>“As Homer gave us an ideal landscape, which even a god might have been pleased to behold, so Dante gives us, fortunately, an ideal landscape, which is specially intended for the terrestrial paradise. And it will doubtless be with some surprise, after our reflections above on the general tone of Dante’s feelings, that we find ourselves here first entering a <em>forest</em>, and that even a <em>thick</em> forest.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“This forest, then, is very like that of Colonos in several respects⁠—in its peace and sweetness, and number of birds; it differs from it only in letting a light breeze through it, being therefore somewhat thinner than the Greek wood; the tender lines which tell of the voices of the birds mingling with the wind, and of the leaves all turning one way before it, have been more or less copied by every poet since Dante’s time. They are, so far as I know, the sweetest passage of wood description which exists in literature.”</p>

					<p>Homer’s ideal landscape, here referred to, is in <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Odyssey</i> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span>, where he describes the visit of Mercury to the Island of Calypso. It is thus translated by Buckley:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Immediately then he bound his beautiful sandals beneath his feet, ambrosial, golden; which carried him both over the moist wave, and over the boundless earth, with the breath of the wind.⁠ ⁠… Then he rushed over the wave like a bird, a seagull, which, hunting for fish in the terrible bays of the barren sea, dips frequently its wings in the brine; like unto this Mercury rode over many waves. But when he came to the distant island, then, going from the blue sea, he went to the continent; until he came to the great cave in which the fair-haired Nymph dwelt; and he found her within. A large fire was burning on the hearth, and at a distance the smell of well-cleft cedar, and of frankincense, that were burning, shed odor through the island: but she within was singing with a beautiful voice, and, going over the web, wove with a golden shuttle. But a flourishing wood sprung up around her grot, alder and poplar, and sweet-smelling cypress. There also birds with spreading wings slept, owls and hawks, and wide tongued crows of the ocean, to which maritime employments are a care. There a vine in its prime was spread about the hollow grot, and it flourished with clusters. But four fountains flowed in succession with white water, turned near one another, each in different ways; but around there flourished soft meadows of violets and of parsley. There indeed even an immortal coming would admire it when he beheld, and would be delighted in his mind; there the messenger, the slayer of Argus, standing, admired.”</p>

					<p>And again, at the close of the same book, where Ulysses reaches the shore at Phaeacia:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Then he hastened to the wood; and found it near the water in a conspicuous place, and he came under two shrubs, which sprang from the same place; one of wild olive, the other of olive. Neither the strength of the moistly blowing winds breathes through them, nor has the shining sun ever struck them with its beams, nor has the shower penetrated entirely through them: so thick were they grown entangled with one another; under which Ulysses came.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The wood of Colonos is thus described in one of the Choruses of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Oedipus Coloneus</i> of Sophocles, Oxford <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, Anon.:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Thou hast come, O stranger, to the seats of this land, renowned for the steed; to seats the fairest on earth, the chalky Colonus; where the vocal nightingale, chief abounding, trills her plaintive note in the green vales, tenanting the dark-hued ivy and the leafy grove of the god, untrodden [by mortal foot], teeming with fruits, impervious to the sun, and unshaken by the winds of every storm; where Bacchus ever roams in revelry companioning his divine nurses. And ever day by day the narcissus, with its beauteous clusters, burst into bloom by heaven’s dew, the ancient coronet of the mighty goddesses, and the saffron with golden ray; nor do the sleepless founts that feed the channels of Cephissus fail, but ever, each day, it rushes o’er the plains with its stainless wave, fertilizing the bosom of the earth; nor have the choirs of the Muses spurned this clime; nor Venus, too, of the golden rein. And there is a tree, such as I hear not to have ever sprung in the land of Asia, nor in the mighty Doric island of Pelops, a tree unplanted by hand, of spontaneous growth, terror of the hostile spear, which flourishes chiefly in this region, the leaf of the azure olive that nourishes our young. This shall neither any one in youth nor in old age, marking for destruction, and having laid it waste with his hand, set its divinity at naught; for the eye that never closes of Morian Jove regards it, and the blue-eyed Minerva.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“But without the hall there is a large garden, near the gates, of four acres; but around it a hedge was extended on both sides. And there tall, flourishing trees grew, pears, and pomegranates, and apple-trees producing beautiful fruit, and sweet figs, and flourishing olives. Of these the fruit never perishes, nor does it fail in winter or summer, lasting throughout the whole year; but the west wind ever blowing makes some bud forth, and ripens others. Pear grows old after pear, apple after apple, grape also after grape, and fig after fig. There a fruitful vineyard was planted: one part of this ground, exposed to the sun in a wide place, is dried by the sun; and some [grapes] they are gathering, and others they are treading, and further on are unripe grapes, having thrown off the flower, and others are slightly changing color. And there are all kinds of beds laid out in order, to the furthest part of the ground, flourishing throughout the whole year: and in it are two fountains, one is spread through the whole garden, but the other on the other side goes under the threshold of the hall to the lofty house, from whence the citizens are wont to draw water.”</p>

					<p>This lady, who represents the Active life to Dante’s waking eyes, as Leah had done in his vision, and whom Dante afterwards. Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXIII</span> 119, calls Matilda, is generally supposed by the commentators to be the celebrated Countess Matilda, daughter of Boniface, Count of Tuscany, and wife of Guelf, of the house of Suabia. Of this marriage Villani, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 21, gives a very strange account, which, if true, is a singular picture of the times. Napier, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Florentine History</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> 4 and 6, gives these glimpses of the Countess:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“This heroine died in 1115, after a reign of active exertion for herself and the Church against the Emperors, which generated the infant and as yet nameless factions of Guelf and Ghibelline. Matilda endured this contest with all the enthusiasm and constancy of a woman, combined with a manly courage that must ever render her name respectable, whether proceeding from the bigotry of the age, or to oppose imperial ambition in defence of her own defective title. According to the laws of that time, she could not as a female inherit her father’s states, for even male heirs required a royal confirmation. Matilda therefore, having no legal right, feared the Emperor and clung to the Popes, who already claimed, among other prerogatives, the supreme disposal of kingdoms.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“The Church had ever come forward as the friend of her house, and from childhood she had breathed an atmosphere of blind and devoted submission to its authority; even when only fifteen she had appeared in arms against its enemies, and made two successful expeditions to assist Pope Alexander the Second during her mother’s lifetime.</p>
						<p>“No wonder, then, that in a superstitious age, when monarchs trembled at an angry voice from the Lateran, the habits of early youth should have mingled with every action of Matilda’s life, and spread an agreeable <em>mirage</em> over the prospect of her eternal salvation: the power that tamed a Henry’s pride, a Barbarossa’s fierceness, and afterwards withstood the vast ability of a Frederic, might without shame have been reverenced by a girl whose feelings so harmonized with the sacred strains of ancient tradition and priestly dignity. But from whatever motive, the result was a continual aggrandizement of ecclesiastics; in prosperity and adversity; during life and after death; from the lowliest priest to the proudest pontiff.</p>
						<p>“The fearless assertion of her own independence by successful struggles with the Emperor was an example not overlooked by the young Italian communities under Matilda’s rule, who were already accused by imperial legitimacy of political innovation and visionary notions of government.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“Being then at a place called Monte Baroncione, and in her sixty-ninth year, this celebrated woman breathed her last, after a long and glorious reign of incessant activity, during which she displayed a wisdom, vigor, and determination of character rarely seen even in men. She bequeathed to the Church all those patrimonial estates of which she had previously disposed by an act of gift to Gregory the Seventh, without, however, any immediate royal power over the cities and other possessions thus given, as her will expresses it, ‘for the good of her soul, and the souls of her parents.’</p>
						<p>“Whatever may now be thought of her chivalrous support, her bold defence, and her deep devotion to the Church, it was in perfect harmony with the spirit of that age, and has formed one of her chief merits with many even in the present. Her unflinching adherence to the cause she had so conscientiously embraced was far more noble than the Emperor Henry’s conduct. Swinging between the extremes of unmeasured insolence and abject humiliation, he died a victim to Papal influence over superstitious minds; an influence which, amongst other debasing lessons, then taught the world that a breach of the most sacred ties and dearest affections of human nature was one means of gaining the approbation of a Being who is all truth and beneficence.</p>
						<p>“Matilda’s object was to strengthen the chief spiritual against the chief temporal power, but reserving her own independence; a policy subsequently pursued, at least in spirit, by the Guelphic states of Italy. She therefore protected subordinate members of the Church against feudal chieftains, and its head against the feudal Emperor. True to her religious and warlike character, she died between the sword and the crucifix, and two of her last acts, even when the hand of death was already cold on her brow, were the chastisement of revolted Mantua, and the midnight celebration of Christ’s nativity in the depth of a freezing and unusually inclement winter.”</p>

In the most ancient mosaics, the type is human, not angelic, for the head is that of a man with a beard.</p>
						<p>“<abbr>St.</abbr> Mark has the <b>Lion</b>, because he has set forth the royal dignity of Christ; or, according to others, because he begins with the mission of the Baptist⁠—‘<em>the voice of one crying in the wilderness,</em>’⁠—which is figured by the lion: or, according to a third interpretation, the lion was allotted to <abbr>St.</abbr> Mark because there was, in the Middle Ages, a popular belief that the young of the lion was born dead, and after three days was awakened to vitality by the breath of its sire; some authors, however, represent the lion as vivifying his young, not by his breath, but by his roar. In either case the application is the same; the revival of the young lion was considered as symbolical of the resurrection, and Mark was commonly called the ‘historian of the resurrection.’ Another commentator observes that Mark begins his Gospel with ‘roaring,’⁠—‘the voice of one crying in the wilderness’; and ends it fearfully with a curse⁠—‘He that believeth not shall be damned’; and that, therefore, his appropriate attribute is the most terrible of beasts, the lion.</p>
						<p>“Luke has the <b>Ox</b>, because he has dwelt on the priesthood of Christ, the <em>ox</em> being the emblem of Sacrifice.</p>
						<p>“John has the <b>Eagle</b>, which is the symbol of the highest inspiration, because he soared upwards to the contemplation of the divine nature of the Saviour.”</p>

					<p>Of this canto and those that follow. Barlow, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Study of the Divina Commedia</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 270, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Dante’s sublime pageant of the Church Militant is one of the most marvellous processions ever marshalled on paper. In the invention, arrangement, grouping, and coloring the poet has shown himself a great master in art, familiar with all the stately requirements of solemn shows, festivals, and triumphs. Whatever he may have gathered from the sacred records, and from classic writers, or seen in early mosaics, or witnessed in the streets of Florence with her joyous population, her May-day dancers, and the military pomp of her magnificent Carroccio, like the arc of the covenant going forth with the host, has here been surpassed in invention and erudition, and a picture produced at once as original as it is impressive, as significant as it is grand. Petrarca was, probably, indebted to it for his ‘Trionfi,’ so frequently in favor with Italian artists.</p>
						<p>“This canto with the four that follow form a poem which, though an essential portion of the Divina Commedia, may be separately considered as the continuation of the poetic vision mentioned in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="it">Vita Nuova</i>, and the fulfilment of the intention there expressed.</p>
						<p>“It represents the symbolical passage of the Christian Church, preceded by the Hebrew dispensation, and followed by the disastrous effects of schism, and the corruptions induced by the unholy conduct of political Pontiffs. The soul of this solemn exhibition, the living and glorified principle of the beatitude which Religion pure and holy confers upon those who embrace it, is personified in the ‘Donna,’ to whom Dante from his earliest youth had been more or less devoted, the Beatrice of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem" xml:lang="it">Vita Nuova</i>, ‘<i xml:lang="it">Loda di Dio vera</i>,’ who concentrates in herself the divine wisdom with which the Church is inspired, whom angels delight to honor, and whose advent on earth had been prepared from all eternity by the moral virtues.</p>
						<p>“Beatrice is here presented as the principle of divine beatitude, or that which confers it, and bears a resemblance to the figure of the New Jerusalem seen by <abbr>St.</abbr> John descending from heaven ‘as a bride adorned for her husband’ (<span epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Rev.</abbr></span> 21:2); a representation of which, in the manner of Raphael, occurs in one of the tapestries of the Vatican, and, though not arrayed in the colors of the Christian virtues. Faith, Hope, and Charity, white and green and red, as was Beatrice, may yet be regarded as a Roman version of her.”</p>

					<p>Didron, describing the painting of the Triumph of Christ in the Church of Notre Dame de Brou, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Christian Iconography</i>, Millington’s <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 315, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In the centre of all rises the Hero of the Triumph, Jesus Christ, who is seated in an open car with four wheels. He alone is adorned with a nimbus formed of rays, departing from each point of the head, and which illumines everything around. With one glance he embraces the past which precedes, and the future which is to succeed him. His face resembles that drawn by Raphael and the masters of the period of Renaissance, agreeing with the description given by Lentulus and Damascenus; it is serious and gentle. In the centre of the chariot is placed a starry globe traversed by the ecliptic, on which the twelve signs of the zodiac are brilliantly figured. This globe is symbolic of the world, and forms a throne for Christ: the Son of God is seated on its summit. The car is placed upon four wheels, and drawn by the four attributes or symbols of the Evangelists. The angel of <abbr>St.</abbr> Matthew, and the eagle of <abbr>St.</abbr> John, are of celestial whiteness; the lion of <abbr>St.</abbr> Mark, and the ox of <abbr>St.</abbr> Luke, are of a reddish yellow, symbolizing the earth on which they dwell. The eagle and angel do, in fact, fly; while the lion and the ox walk. Yet upon the painted window all the four have wings. A rein of silver, passing round the neck of each of the four symbols, is attached to the pole of the chariot. The Church, represented by the four most elevated religious potentates, by the Pope, the Cardinal, the Archbishop, and Bishop, or by the four chief Fathers, <abbr>St.</abbr> Gregory, <abbr>St.</abbr> Jerome, <abbr>St.</abbr> Ambrose, and <abbr>St.</abbr> Augustine, drives the four-wheeled car, and, in conjunction with the Evangelists, urges it onward. Jesus guides his triumph, not holding reins, but shedding blessings from his right hand wherever he passes.</p>
						<p>“The entire assemblage of persons represented on the window are seen marching onwards, singing with joy. Within the spaces formed by the mullions which trellis the upper part of the window, forty-six angels are represented with long golden hair, white transparent robes, and wings of yellow, red, violet, and green; they are all painted on a background of azure, like the sky, and celebrate with blended voices, or with musical instruments, the glory of Christ. Some have in their hands instruments of different forms, others books of music. The four animals of the Evangelists seem with sonorous voice to swell the acclamations of the hosts of saints; the ox with his bellowing, the lion with his roar, the eagle with his cry, and the angel with his song, accompany the songs of the forty-six angels who fill the upper part of the window. At the head of the procession is an angel who leads the entire company, and, with a little cross which he holds in his hand, points out to all the Paradise they are to enter. Finally, twelve other angels, blue as the heaven into which they melt, join in adoration before the triumph of Christ.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“Dante has given a description of a similar triumph, but marked by some interesting differences. The Florentine poet formed his cortege of figures taken from the Apocalypse and Christian symbolism. At Brou, with the exception of the attributes of the Evangelists, everything is historical. In the sixteenth century, in fact, history began to predominate over symbolism, which in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries had reigned supreme. Dante, who was a politic poet, drew the triumph, not of Christ, but of the Church; the triumph of Catholicism rather than of Christianity. The chariot by which he represents the Church is widowed of Christ, whose figure is so important on the window of Brou; the chariot is empty, and Dante neither discovered this deficiency, nor was concerned to rectify it; for he was less anxious to celebrate Christ and his doctrine, for their own sake, than as connected with the organization and administration of the Church. He described the car as drawn by a griffin, thereby representing the Pope, for the griffin unites in itself the characteristics of both eagle and lion. Now the Pope is also twofold in character; as priest he is the eagle floating in the air; as king, he is a lion, walking upon the earth. The Ultramontane poet regarded the Church, that is the Papacy, in the light of an absolute monarchy; not a limited monarchy as with us, and still less a republic, as amongst the schismatics of Greece and of the East. Consequently, while, at Brou, the Cardinal, the Archbishop, and Bishop assist the Pope in guiding the car of the Church, in the ‘Divina Commedia,’ the Pope is alone, and accepts of no assistance from the other great ecclesiastical dignitaries. At Brou the car is guided by the Evangelists, or by their attributes; ecclesiastical power is content merely to lend its aid. According to the Italian poet, the Evangelists, although present at the Triumph, do not conduct it; the Pope is himself the sole guide of the Church, and permits neither the Evangelists to direct nor ecclesiastics to assist him. The Pope seems to require no assistance; his eye and arm alone are sufficient for him.”</p>

She appeared to me clothed in a most noble color, a becoming and modest crimson, and she was girt and adorned in the style that became her extreme youth. At that instant, I say truly, the spirit of life, which dwells in the most secret chamber of the heart, began to tremble with such violence, that it appeared fearfully in the least pulses, and, trembling, said these words: <i xml:lang="la">Ecce deus fortior me, qui veniens dominabitur mihi!</i> ‘Behold a god, stronger than I, who, coming, shall rule me!’</p>
						<p>“At that instant, the spirit of the soul, which dwells in the high chamber to which all the spirits of the senses bring their perceptions, began to marvel greatly, and, addressing the spirits of the sight, said these words: <i xml:lang="la">Apparuit jam beatitudo vestra</i>⁠—‘Now hath appeared your bliss.’ “At that instant the natural spirit, which dwells in that part where the nourishment is supplied, began to weep, and, weeping, said these words: <i xml:lang="la">Heu miser! quia frequenter impeditus ero deinceps</i>⁠—‘Woe is me wretched! because frequently henceforth shall I be hindered.’</p>
						<p>“From this time forward I say that Love lorded it over my soul, which had been thus quickly put at his disposal; and he began to exercise over me such control and such lordship, through the power which my imagination gave to him, that it behoved me to perform completely all his pleasure. He commanded me many times that I should seek to see this youthful angel, so that I in my boyhood often went seeking her, and saw her of such noble and praiseworthy deportment, that truly of her might be said that saying of the poet Homer: ‘She does not seem the daughter of mortal man, but of God.’ And though her image, which stayed constantly with me, inspired confidence in Love to hold lordship over me, yet it was of such noble virtue, that it never suffered that Love should rule without the faithful counsel of Reason in those matters in which such counsel could be useful.”</p>

					<p>Buti gives a different interpretation of the word <i xml:lang="it">pargoletta</i>, making it the same as <i xml:lang="it">pargultà</i> or <i xml:lang="it">pargolezza</i>, “childishness or indiscretion of youth.”</p>
					<p>In all this unnecessary confusion one thing is quite evident. As Beatrice is speaking of the past, she could not possibly allude to Gentucca, who is spoken of as one who would make Lucca pleasant to Dante at some future time:⁠—</p>

The branch grew into a tree, but never bore fruit till the passion of Christ; but “of a branch of this tree and of other wood,” says Buti, “the cross was made, and from that branch was suspended such sweet fruit as the body of our Lord Jesus Christ, and then Adam and other saints had the oil of mercy, inasmuch as they were taken from Limbo and led by Christ into eternal life.” <a href="purgatorio.xhtml#noteref-1154" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

						<p>“Some three arrow-flights farther up into the wood we come to a tall tree, which is at first barren, but, after some little time, visibly opens into flowers, of a color ‘less than that of roses, but more than that of violets.’ It certainly would not be possible, in words, to come nearer to the <em>definition</em> of the exact hue which Dante meant⁠—that of the appleblossom. Had he employed any simple colorphrase, as a ‘pale pink,’ or ‘violet pink,’ or any other such combined expression, he still could not have completely got at the delicacy of the hue; he might perhaps have indicated its kind, but not its tenderness; but by taking the rose-leaf as the type of the delicate red, and then enfeebling this with the violet gray, he gets, as closely as language can carry him, to the complete rendering of the vision, though it is evidently felt by him to be in its perfect beauty ineffable; and rightly so felt, for of all lovely things which grace the springtime in our fair temperate zone, I am not sure but this blossoming of the apple-tree is the fairest.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The inheritance of peace, as the immense love of God witnesseth, was left us, that in the marvellous sweetness thereof our hard warfare might be softened, and by the use thereof we might deserve the joys of our triumphant country. But the hatred of the ancient and implacable enemy, who ever and secretly layeth snares for human prosperity⁠—disinheriting some of those who were willing⁠—impiously, in the absence of our protector, despoiled us also, who were unwilling. Wherefore we wept long by the rivers of confusion, and incessantly implored the protection of the just king, to scatter the satellites of the cruel tyrant, and restore us to our just rights. And when thou, successor of Caesar and of Augustus, crossing the chain of the Apennines, brought back the venerable Tarpeian ensigns, our long sighings straightway ceased, the fountains of our tears were stayed, and a new hope of a better age, like a sun suddenly risen, shed its beams over Latium. Then many, breaking forth into jubilant vows, sang with Mars the Saturnian reign, and the return of the Virgin.</p>
						<p>“But since our sun (whether the fervor of desire suggests it, or the aspect of truth) is already believed to have delayed, or is supposed to be going back in his course, as if a new Joshua or the son of Amos had commanded, we are compelled in our uncertainty to doubt, and to break forth in the words of the Forerunner: ‘Art thou he that should come, or look we for another?’ And although the fury of long thirst turns into doubt, as is its wont, the things which are certain because they are near, nevertheless we believe and hope in thee, asserting thee to be the minister of God, and the son of the Church, and the promoter of the Roman glory. And I, who write as well for myself as for others, when my hands touched thy feet and my lips performed their office, saw thee most benignant, as becometh the Imperial majesty, and heard thee most clement. Then my spirit exulted within me, and I silently said to myself, ‘Behold the lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world.’ ”</p>

Besides, on the banks of this river, on either side, were green trees for all manner of fruit; and the leaves they ate to prevent surfeits and other diseases that are incident to those that heat their blood by travels. On either side of the river was also a meadow, curiously beautified with lilies; and it was green all the year long. In this meadow they lay down and slept; for here they might lie down safely. When they awoke, they gathered again of the fruits of the trees, and drank again of the water of the river, and then lay down again to sleep.”</p>

					<p>Thus, taking the earth as the central point, and speaking of the order of the Ten Heavens, Dante says, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 4:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The first is that where the Moon is; the second is that where Mercury is; the third is that where Venus is; the fourth is that where the Sun is; the fifth is that where Mars is; the sixth is that where Jupiter is; the seventh is that where Saturn is; the eighth is that of the Stars; the ninth is not visible, save by the motion mentioned above, and is called by many the Crystalline; that is, diaphanous, or wholly transparent. Beyond all these, indeed, the Catholics place the Empyrean Heaven; that is to say, the Heaven of flame, or luminous; and this they suppose to be immovable, from having within itself, in every part, that which its matter demands. And this is the cause why the Primum Mobile has a very swift motion; from the fervent longing which each part of that ninth heaven has to be conjoined with that Divinest Heaven, the Heaven of Rest, which is next to it, it revolves therein with so great desire, that its velocity is almost incomprehensible; and quiet and peaceful is the place of that supreme Deity, who alone doth perfectly see himself.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of the symbolism of these Heavens he says, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 14:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“As narrated above, the seven Heavens nearest to us are those of the Planets; and above these are two movable Heavens, and one motionless over all. To the first seven correspond the seven sciences of the Trivium and Quadrivium; that is, Grammar, Dialectics, Rhetoric, Arithmetic, Music, Geometry, and Astrology. To the eighth, that is, to the starry sphere, Natural Science, called Physics, corresponds, and the first science, which is called Metaphysics; and to the ninth sphere corresponds Moral Science; and to the Heaven of Rest, the Divine Science, which is called Theology.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The details of these correspondences will be given later in their appropriate places.</p>
					<p>These Ten Heavens are the heavens of the Paradiso; nine of them revolving about the earth as a central point, and the motionless Empyrean encircling and containing all.</p>
					<p>In the first Heaven, or that of the Moon, are seen the spirits of those who, having taken monastic vows, were forced to violate them. In the second, or that of Mercury, the spirits of those whom desire of fame incited to noble deeds. In the third, or that of Venus, the spirits of Lovers. In the fourth, or that of the Sun, the spirits of Theologians and Fathers of the Church. In the fifth, or that of Mars, the spirits of Crusaders and those who died for the true Faith. In the sixth, or that of Jupiter, the spirits of righteous Kings and Rulers. In the seventh, or that of Saturn, the spirits of the Contemplative. In the eighth, or that of the Fixed Stars, the Triumph of Christ. In the ninth, or Primum Mobile, the Angelic Hierarchies. In the tenth, or the Empyrean, is the Visible Presence of God.</p>
					<p>It must be observed, however, that the lower spheres, in which the spirits appear, are not assigned them as their places or dwellings. They show themselves in these different places only to indicate to Dante the different degrees of glory which they enjoy, and to show that while on earth they were under the influence of the planets in which they here appear. Dante expressly says, in Canto <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> 28:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">

					<p>Rixner, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="gem">Handbuch der Geschichte der Philosophie</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 100, speaking of the ten heavens, or the Lyre of Pythagoras, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“These ten celestial spheres are arranged among themselves in an order so mathematical and musical, that is so harmonious, that the sphere of the fixed stars, which is above the sphere of Saturn, gives forth the deepest tone in the music of the universe (the World-Lyre strung with ten strings), and that of the Moon the highest.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Cicero, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Vision of Scipio</i>, inverts the tones. He says, Edmonds’s <abbr>Tr.</abbr>:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Which as I was gazing at in amazement, I said, as I recovered myself, from whence proceed these sounds so strong, and yet so sweet, that fill my ears? ‘The melody,’ replies he, ‘which you hear, and which, though composed in unequal time, is nevertheless divided into regular harmony, is effected by the impulse and motion of the spheres themselves, which, by a happy temper of sharp and grave notes, regularly produces various harmonic effects. Now it is impossible that such prodigious movements should pass in silence; and nature teaches that the sounds which the spheres at one extremity utter must be sharp, and those on the other extremity must be grave; on which account, that highest revolution of the star-studded heaven, whose motion is more rapid, is carried on with a sharp and quick sound; whereas this of the moon, which is situated the lowest, and at the other extremity, moves with the gravest sound. For the earth, the ninth sphere, remaining motionless, abides invariably in the innermost position, occupying the central spot in the universe.</p>
						<p>“ ‘Now these eight directions, two of which have the same powers, effect seven sounds, differing in their modulations, which number is the connecting principle of almost all things. Some learned men, by imitating this harmony with strings and vocal melodies, have opened a way for their return to this place; as all others have done, who, endued with preeminent qualities, have cultivated in their mortal life the pursuits of heaven.</p>
						<p>“ ‘The ears of mankind, filled with these sounds, have become deaf, for of all your senses it is the most blunted. Thus, the people who live near the place where the Nile rushes down from very high mountains to the parts which are called Catadupa, are destitute of the sense of hearing, by reason of the greatness of the noise. Now this sound, which is effected by the rapid rotation of the whole system of nature, is so powerful that human hearing can not comprehend it, just as you cannot look directly upon the sun, because your sight and sense are overcome by his beams.’ ”</p>

The other is the variation of its brightness, which now shines on one side, and now upon the other, according as the sun looks upon it. And Grammar has these two properties; since, on account of its infinity, the rays of reason do not terminate in it in any special part of its words; and it shines now on this side, and now on that, inasmuch as certain words, certain declinations, certain constructions, are in use which once were not, and many once were which will be again.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The last part of the Commedia, which Dante finished about this time (1320),⁠ ⁠… is said to be the most difficult and obscure part of the whole poem. And it is so; and it would be in vain for us to attempt to awaken in the generality of readers that attention which Dante has not been able to obtain for himself. Readers in general will always be repulsed by the difficulties of its numerous allegories, by the series of heavens, arranged according to the now forgotten Ptolemaic system, and more than all by disquisitions on philosophy and theology which often degenerate into mere scholastic themes. With the exception of the three cantos relating to Cacciaguida, and a few other episodes which recall us to earth, as well as those verses in which frequently Dante’s love for Beatrice shines forth, the Paradiso must not be considered as pleasant reading for the general reader, but as an especial recreation for those who find there, expressed in sublime verse, those contemplations that have been the subjects of their philosophical and theological studies.⁠ ⁠… But few will always be the students of philosophy and theology, and much fewer those who look upon these sciences as almost one and the same thing, pursued by two different methods; these, if I am not mistaken, will find in Dante’s Paradiso a treasure of thought, and the loftiest and most soothing words of comfort, forerunners of the joys of Heaven itself. Above all, the Paradiso will delight those who find themselves, when they are reading it, in a somewhat similar disposition of mind to that of Dante when he was writing it; those in short who, after having in their youth lived in the world, and sought happiness in it, have now arrived at maturity, old age, or satiety, and seek by the means of philosophy and theology to know as far as possible of that other world on which their hopes now rest. Philosophy is the romance of the aged, and Religion the only future history for us all. Both these subjects of contemplation we find in Dante’s Paradise, and pursued with a rare modesty, not beyond the limits of our understanding, and with due submission to the Divine Law which placed these limits.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The satellites of the tyrant, hearing that the treasures of the church had been confided to Lawrence, carried him before the tribunal, and he was questioned, but replied not one word; therefore he was put into a dungeon, under the charge of a man named Hippolytus, whom with his whole family he converted to the faith of Christ, and baptized; and when he was called again before the Prefect, and required to say where the treasures were concealed, he answered that in three days he would show them. The third day being come, <abbr>St.</abbr> Lawrence gathered together the sick and the poor, to whom he had dispensed alms, and, placing them before the Prefect, said, ‘Behold, here are the treasures of Christ’s Church.’ Upon this the Prefect, thinking he was mocked, fell into a great rage, and ordered <abbr>St.</abbr> Lawrence to be tortured till he had made known where the treasures were concealed; but no suffering could subdue the patience and constancy of the holy martyr. Then the Prefect commanded that he should be carried by night to the baths of Olympias, near the villa of Sallust the historian, and that a new kind of torture should be prepared for him, more strange and cruel than had ever entered into the heart of a tyrant to conceive; for he ordered him to be stretched on a sort of bed, formed of iron bars in the manner of a gridiron, and a fire to be lighted beneath, which should gradually consume his body to ashes: and the executioners did as they were commanded, kindling the fire and adding coals from time to time, so that the victim was in a manner roasted alive; and those who were present looked on with horror, and wondered at the cruelty of the Prefect, who could condemn to such torments a youth of such fair person and courteous and gentle bearing, and all for the lust of gold.”</p>

						<p>“The story of Mutius is variously given; we, like others, must follow the commonly received statement. He was a man endowed with every virtue, but most eminent in war; and resolving to kill Porsenna, attired himself in the Tuscan habit, and using the Tuscan language, came to the camp, and approaching the seat where the king sat amongst his nobles, but not certainly knowing the king, and fearful to inquire, drew out his sword, and stabbed one who he thought had most the appearance of king. Mutius was taken in the act, and whilst he was under examination, a pan of fire was brought to the king, who intended to sacrifice; Mutius thrust his right hand into the flame, and whilst it burnt stood looking at Porsenna with a steadfast and undaunted countenance; Porsenna at last in admiration dismissed him, and returned his sword, reaching it from his seat; Mutius received it in his left hand, which occasioned the name of Scaevola, left-handed, and said, ‘I have overcome the terrors of Porsenna, yet am vanquished by his generosity, and gratitude obliges me to disclose what no punishment could extort’; and assured him then, that three hundred Romans, all of the same resolution, lurked about his camp only waiting for an opportunity; he, by lot appointed to the enterprise, was not sorry that he had miscarried in it, because so brave and good a man deserved rather to be a friend to the Romans than an enemy.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Emperor was easy of access, patient of hearing, courteous and affable in discourse, and a master of the angry passions, which rage with such destructive violence in the breast of a despot. Procopius praises his temper to reproach him with calm and deliberate cruelty; but in the conspiracies which attacked his authority and person, a more candid judge will approve the justice or admire the clemency of Justinian. He excelled in the private virtues of chastity and temperance; but the impartial love of beauty would have been less mischievous than his conjugal tenderness for Theodora; and his abstemious diet was regulated, not by the prudence of a philosopher, but the superstition of a monk. His repasts were short and frugal; on solemn fasts he contented himself with water and vegetables; and such was his strength as well as fervor, that he frequently passed two days, and as many nights, without tasting any food. The measure of his sleep was not less rigorous; after the repose of a single hour the body was awakened by the soul, and, to the astonishment of his chamberlain, Justinian walked or studied till the morning light. Such restless application prolonged his time for the acquisition of knowledge and the despatch of business; and he might seriously deserve the reproach of confounding, by minute and preposterous diligence, the general order of his administration. The Emperor professed himself a musician and architect, a poet and philosopher, a lawyer and theologian; and if he failed in the enterprise of reconciling the Christian sects, the review of the Roman jurisprudence is a noble monument of his spirit and industry. In the government of the empire he was less wise or less successful: the age was unfortunate; the people was oppressed and discontented; Theodora abused her power; a succession of bad ministers disgraced his judgment; and Justinian was neither beloved in his life, nor regretted at his death. The love of fame was deeply implanted in his breast, but he condescended to the poor ambition of titles, honors, and contemporary praise; and while he labored to fix the admiration, he forfeited the esteem and affection of the Romans.”</p>

					<p>Agapetus was Pope, or Bishop of Rome, in the year 515, and was compelled by King Theodotus the Ostrogoth to go upon an embassy to the Emperor Justinian at Constantinople, where he refused to hold any communication with Anthimus, Bishop of Trebizond, who, against the canon of the Church, had been transferred from his own see to that of Constantinople. Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 460, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Agapetus, in a conference, condescended, to satisfy the Emperor as to his own unimpeachable orthodoxy. Justinian sternly commanded him to communicate with Anthimus. ‘With the Bishop of Trebizond,’ replied the unawed ecclesiastic, ‘when he has returned to his diocese, and accepted the Council of Chalcedon and the letters of Leo.’ The Emperor in a louder voice commanded him to acknowledge the Bishop of Constantinople on pain of immediate exile. ‘I came hither in my old age to see, as I supposed, a religious and a Christian Emperor; I find a new Diocletian. But I fear not kings’ menaces, I am ready to lay down my life for the truth.’ The feeble mind of Justinian passed at once from the height of arrogance to admiration and respect; he listened to the charges advanced by Agapetus against the orthodoxy of Anthimus. In his turn the Bishop of Constantinople was summoned to render an account of his theology before the Emperor, convicted of Eutychianism, and degraded from the see.”</p>

					<p>Belisarius, the famous general, to whom Justinian gave the leadership of his armies in Africa and Italy. In his old age he was suspected of conspiring against the Emperor’s life; but the accusation was not proved. Gibbon, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decline and Fall</i>, <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLI</span>, speaks of him thus:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Africanus of new Rome was born, and perhaps educated, among the Thracian peasants, without any of those advantages which had formed the virtues of the elder and the younger Scipio, a noble origin, liberal studies, and the emulation of a free state. The silence of a loquacious secretary may be admitted, to prove that the youth of Belisarius could not afford any subject of praise: he served, most assuredly with valor and reputation, among the private guards of Justinian; and when his patron became Emperor, the domestic was promoted to military command.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>And of his last years as follows, <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XLIII</span>:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Capricious pardon and arbitrary punishment embittered the irksomeness and discontent of a long reign; a conspiracy was formed in the palace, and, unless we are deceived by the names of Marcellus and Sergius, the most virtuous and the most profligate of the courtiers were associated in the same designs. They had fixed the time of the execution; their rank gave them access to the royal banquet, and their black slaves were stationed in the vestibule and porticos to announce the death of the tyrant, and to excite a sedition in the capital. But the indiscretion of an accomplice saved the poor remnant of the days of Justinian. The conspirators were detected and seized, with daggers hidden under their garments; Marcellus died by his own hand, and Sergius was dragged from the sanctuary. Pressed by remorse, or tempted by the hopes of safety, he accused two officers of the household of Belisarius; and torture forced them to declare that they had acted according to the secret instructions of their patron. Posterity will not hastily believe that an hero who, in the vigor of life, had disdained the fairest offers of ambition and revenge, should stoop to the murder of his prince, whom he could not long expect to survive. His followers were impatient to fly; but flight must have been supported by rebellion, and he had lived enough for nature and for glory. Belisarius appeared before the council with less fear than indignation; after forty years’ service, the Emperor had prejudged his guilt; and injustice was sanctified by the presence and authority of the patriarch. The life of Belisarius was graciously spared; but his fortunes were sequestered, and from December to July he was guarded as a prisoner in his own palace. At length his innocence was acknowledged; his freedom and honors were restored; and death, which might be hastened by resentment and grief, removed him from the world about eight months after his deliverance. The name of Belisarius can never die; but instead of the funeral, the monuments, the statues, so justly due to his memory, I only read that his treasures, the spoils of the Goths and Vandals, were immediately confiscated for the Emperor. Some decent portion was reserved, however, for the use of his widow; and as Antonina had much to repent, she devoted the last remains of her life and fortune to the foundation of a convent. Such is the simple and genuine narrative of the fall of Belisarius and the ingratitude of Justinian. That he was deprived of his eyes, and reduced by envy to beg his bread⁠—‘Give a penny to Belisarius the general!’⁠—is a fiction of later times, which has obtained credit, or rather favor, as a strange example of the vicissitudes, of fortune.”</p>

And therefore our author feigns, that those who have been active in the world, and have lived with political and moral virtues, show themselves in the sphere of Mercury, because Mercury exercises such influence, according to the astrologers, as has been shown; but it is in man’s free will to follow the good influence and avoid the bad, and hence springs the merit and demerit.”</p>

					<p>Villani, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VI</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> 90, relates the story of Romeo (in Italian Roméo) as follows, though it will be observed that he uses the word <em>romeo</em> not as a proper, but as a common noun, in its sense of pilgrim:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“There arrived at his court a pilgrim, who was returning from <abbr>St.</abbr> James; and hearing of the goodness of Count Raymond, he tarried in his court, and was so wise and worthy, and found such favor with the Count, that he made him master and director of all things. He was always clad in a decent and clerical habit, and in a short time, by his dexterity and wisdom, increased the income of his lord threefold, maintaining always a grand and honorable court.⁠ ⁠… Four daughters had the Count, and no son. By the wisdom and address of the good pilgrim, he first married the eldest to the good King Louis of France by means of money, saying to the Count, ‘Let me manage this, and do not be troubled at the cost; for if thou marry the first well, on account of this relationship thou wilt marry all the others better, and at less cost.’ And so it came to pass; for straightway the king of England, in order to be brother-in-law of the king of France, took the second for a small sum of money; then his brother, being elected King of the Romans, took the third; and the fourth still remaining to be married, the good pilgrim said, ‘With this one I want thee to have a brave son, who shall be thy heir’; and so he did. Finding Charles, Count of Anjou, brother of King Louis of France, he said, ‘Give her to this man, for he will be the best man in the world’; prophesying concerning him, and so it was done. Then it came to pass through envy, which spoils every good thing, that the barons of Provence accused the good pilgrim of having badly managed the treasury of the Count, and had him called to a reckoning. The noble pilgrim said: ‘Count, I have served thee a long time, and brought thee from low to high estate, and for this, through false counsel of thy folk, thou art little grateful. I came to thy court a poor pilgrim, and have lived modestly on thy bounty. Have my mule and my staff and scrip given back to me as when I came, and I ask no further wages.’ The Count would not have him go; but on no account would he remain; and he departed as he had come, and never was it known whence he came, nor whither he went. Many thought that his was a sainted soul.”</p>

						<p>“And in these two places I say these pleasures appear, saying, <em>In her eyes and in her sweet smile</em>; which two places by a beautiful similitude may be called balconies of the Lady who inhabits the edifice of the body, that is, the Soul; since here, although as if veiled, she often shows herself. She shows herself in the eyes so manifestly, that he who looks carefully can recognize her present passion. Hence, inasmuch as six passions are peculiar to the human soul, of which the Philosopher makes mention in his Rhetoric, that is, grace, zeal, mercy, envy, love, and shame, with none of these can the Soul be impassioned, without its semblance coming to the window of the eyes, unless it be kept within by great effort. Hence one of old plucked out his eyes, so that his inward shame might not appear outwardly, as Statius the poet relates of Theban Oedipus, when he says, that in eternal night he hid his shame accursed. She shows herself in the mouth, as color behind glass. And what is laughter but a coruscation of the delight of the soul, that is, a light appearing outwardly, as it exists within? And therefore it behoveth man to show his soul in moderate joy, to laugh moderately with dignified severity, and with slight motion of the arms; so that the Lady who then shows herself, as has been said, may appear modest, and not dissolute. Hence the Book of the Four Cardinal Virtues commands us, ‘Let thy laughter be without cachinnation, that is to say, without cackling like a hen.’ Ah, wonderful laughter of my Lady, that never was perceived but by the eye!”</p>

						<p>“Nothing in later times ought to obscure the glory of Hipparchus, and, as some think, the still greater Ptolemy. Amid the bewilderment of these planetary motions, what could they say, except that the ‘gods never act without design’; and thereon resolve to discern it? The motion of the Earth was concealed from them: nor was aught intelligible or explicable concerning the wanderings of the planets, except the grand revolution of the sky around the Earth. That Earth, small to us, they therefore, on the ground of phenomena, considered the centre of the Universe, thinking, perhaps, not more confinedly than persons in repute in modern days. Around that centre all motion seemed to pass in order the most regular; and if a few bodies appeared to interrupt the regularity of that order, why not conceive the existence of some arrangement by which they might be reconciled with it? It was a strange, but most ingenious idea. They could not tell how, by any simple system of circular and uniform motion, the ascertained courses of the planets, as <em>directly observed</em>, were to be accounted for; but they made a most artificial scheme, that still saved the immobility of the Earth. Suppose a person passing around a room holding a lamp, and all the while turning on his heel. If he turned round uniformly, there would be no actual interruption of the uniform circular motion both of the carrier and the carried; but the light, <em>as seen by an observer in the interior</em>, would make strange gyrations. Unable to account otherwise for the irregularities of the planets, they mounted them in this manner, on small circles, whose <em>centres only</em> revolved regularly around the Earth, but which, during their revolutionary motion, also revolved around their own centres. Styling these cycles and epicycles, the ancient learned men framed that grand system of the Heavens concerning which Ptolemy composed his ‘Syntax.’ ”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“It was at a festival on Easter Tuesday that a multitude of the inhabitants of Palermo and the neighborhood had thronged to a church, about half a mile out of the town, dedicated to the Holy Ghost. The religious service was over, the merriment begun; tables were spread, the amusements of all sorts, games, dances under the trees, were going gayly on; when the harmony was suddenly interrupted and the joyousness chilled by the appearance of a body of French soldiery, under the pretext of keeping the peace. The French mingled familiarly with the people, paid court, not in the most respectful manner, to the women; the young men made sullen remonstrances, and told them to go their way. The Frenchmen began to draw together. ‘These rebellious Paterins must have arms, or they would not venture on such insolence.’ They began to search some of them for arms. The two parties were already glaring at each other in angry hostility. At that moment the beautiful daughter of Roger Mastrangelo, a maiden of exquisite loveliness and modesty, with her bridegroom, approached the church. A Frenchman, named Drouet, either in wantonness or insult, came up to her, and, under the pretence of searching for arms, thrust his hand into her bosom. The girl fainted in her bridegroom’s arms. He uttered in his agony the fatal cry, ‘Death to the French!’ A youth rushed forward, stabbed Drouet to the heart with his own sword, was himself struck down. The cry, the shriek, ran through the crowd, ‘Death to the French!’ Many Sicilians fell, but, of two hundred on the spot, not one Frenchman escaped. The cry spread to the city: Mastrangelo took the lead; every house was stormed, every hole and corner searched; their dress, their speech, their persons, their manners, denounced the French. The palace was forced; the Justiciary, being luckily wounded in the face, and rolled in the dust, and so undetected, mounted a horse, and fled with two followers. Two thousand French were slain. They denied them decent burial, heaped them together in a great pit. The horrors of the scene were indescribable; the insurgents broke into the convents, the churches. The friars, especial objects of hatred, were massacred; they slew the French monks, the French priests. Neither old age, nor sex, nor infancy was spared.”</p>

					<p>Folco, or Folchetto, of Marseilles (Folquet de Marseilles) was a noted Troubadour, who flourished at the end of the twelfth century. He was the son of a rich merchant of Marseilles, and after his father’s death, giving up business for pleasure and poetry, became a frequenter of courts and favorite of lords and princes. Among his patrons are mentioned King Richard of England, King Alfonso of Aragon, Count Raymond of Toulouse, and the Sire Barral of Marseilles. The old Provençal chronicler in Raynouard, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">V</span> 150, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“He was a good Troubadour, and very attractive in person. He paid court to the wife of his lord, Sire Barral, and besought her love, and made songs about her. But neither for prayers nor songs could he find favor with her so as to procure any mark of love, of which he was always complaining in his songs.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Nevertheless this Lady Alazais listened with pleasure to his songs and praises; and was finally moved to jealousy, if not to love. The Troubadour was at the same time paying his homage to the two sisters of the Sire Barral, Lady Laura and Lady Mabel, both beautiful and <i xml:lang="es">de gran valor</i>, and being accused thereof, fell into disfavor and banishment, the Lady Alazais wishing to hear no more his prayers nor his songs. In his despair he took refuge at the court of William, lord of Montpellier, whose wife, daughter of the Emperor Manuel, “comforted him a little, and besought him not to be downcast and despairing, but for love of her to sing and make songs.”</p>
					<p>And now a great change came over him. The old chronicler goes on to say:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“And it came to pass that the Lady Alazais died; and the Sire Barral, her husband and his lord, died; and died the good King Richard, and the good Count Raymond of Toulouse, and King Alfonso of Aragon: whereat, in grief for his lady and for the princes who were dead, he abandoned the world, and retired to a Cistercian convent, with his wife and two sons. And he became Abbot of a rich abbey in Provence, called Torondet, and afterwards Bishop of Toulouse, and there he died.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It was in 1200 that he became a Cistercian, and he died in 1233. It would be pleasant to know that he atoned for his youthful follies by an old age of virtues. But unfortunately for his fame, the old nightingale became a bird of prey. He was deeply implicated in the persecutions of the Albigenses, and the blood of those “slaughtered saints” makes a ghastly rubric in his breviary. <a href="paradiso.xhtml#noteref-1401" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Heaven of the Sun may be compared to Arithmetic on account of two properties; the first is, that with its light all the other stars are informed; the second is, that the eye cannot behold it. And these two properties are in Arithmetic, for with its light all the sciences are illuminated, since their subjects are all considered under some number, and in the consideration thereof we always proceed with numbers; as in natural science the subject is the movable body, which movable body has in it ratio of continuity, and this has in it ratio of infinite number. And the chief consideration of natural science is to consider the principles of natural things, which are three, namely, matter, species, and form; in which this number is visible, not only in all together, but, if we consider well, in each one separately. Therefore Pythagoras, according to Aristotle in the first book of his Physics, gives the odd and even as the principles of natural things, considering all things to be number. The other property of the Sun is also seen in number, to which Arithmetic belongs, for the eye of the intellect cannot behold it, for number considered in itself is infinite; and this we cannot comprehend.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In this Heaven of the Sun are seen the spirits of theologians and Fathers of the Church; and its influences, according to Albumasar, cited by Buti, are as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Sun signifies the vital soul, light and splendor, reason and intellect, science and the measure of life; it signifies kings, princes and leaders, nobles and magnates and congregations of men, strength and victory, voluptuousness, beauty and grandeur, subtleness of mind, pride and praise, good desire of kingdom and of subjects, and great love of gold, and affluence of speech, and delight in neatness and beauty. It signifies faith and the worship of God, judges and wise men, fathers and brothers and mediators; it joins itself to men and mingles among them, it gives what is asked for, and is strong in vengeance, that is to say, it punishes rebels and malefactors.”</p>

					<p>Albertus Magnus, at whose twenty-one ponderous folios one gazes with awe and amazement, was born of a noble Swabian family at the beginning of the thirteenth century.

He became Provincial of his Order in Germany; and was afterward made Grandmaster of the Palace at Rome, and then Bishop of Ratisbon.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Albert the Great at once awed by his immense erudition and appalled his age. His name, the Universal Doctor, was the homage to his all-embracing knowledge. He quotes, as equally familiar, Latin, Greek, Arabic, Jewish philosophers. He was the first Schoolman who lectured on Aristotle himself, on Aristotle from Graeco-Latin or Arabo-Latin copies. The whole range of the Stagirite’s physical and metaphysical philosophy was within the scope of Albert’s teaching. In later days he was called the Ape of Aristotle; he had dared to introduce Aristotle into the Sanctuary itself. One of his Treatises is a refutatation of the Arabian Averrhoes. Nor is it Aristotle and Averrhoes alone that come within the pale of Albert’s erudition; the commentators and glossators of Aristotle, the whole circle of the Arabians, are quoted; their opinions, their reasonings, even their words, with the utmost familiarity. But with Albert Theology was still the master-science. The Bishop of Ratisbon was of unimpeached orthodoxy; the vulgar only, in his wonderful knowledge of the secrets of Nature, in his studies of Natural History, could not but see something of the magician. Albert had the ambition of reconciling Plato and Aristotle, and of reconciling this harmonized Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy with Christian Divinity. He thus, in some degree, misrepresented or misconceived both the Greeks; he hardened Plato into Aristotelism, expanded Aristotelism into Platonism; and his Christianity, though Albert was a devout man, while it constantly subordinates, in strong and fervent language, knowledge to faith and love, less a religion than a philosophy.”</p>

					<p>Thomas Aquinas, the Angelic Doctor of the Schools. Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 265, gives the following sketch of him:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Of all the schoolmen Thomas Aquinas has left the greatest name. He was a son of the Count of Aquino, a rich fief in the kingdom of Naples. His mother, Theodora, was of the line of the old Norman kings; his brothers, Reginald and Landolph, held high rank in the Imperial armies. His family was connected by marriage with the Hohenstaufens; they had Swabian blood in their veins, and so the great schoolman was of the race of Frederick <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. Monasticism seized on Thomas in his early youth; he became an inmate of Monte Casino; at sixteen years of age he caught the more fiery and vigorous enthusiasm of the Dominicans. By them he was sent⁠—no unwilling proselyte and pupil⁠—to France. He was seized by his worldly brothers, and sent back to Naples; he was imprisoned in one of the family castles, but resisted even the fond entreaties of his mother and his sisters. He persisted in his pious disobedience, his holy hardness of heart; he was released after two years’ imprisonment⁠—it might seem strange⁠—at the command of the Emperor Frederick <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>. The godless Emperor, as he was called, gave Thomas to the Church. Aquinas took the irrevocable vow of a Friar Preacher. He became a scholar of Albert the Great at Cologne and at Paris. He was dark, silent, unapproachable even by his brethren, perpetually wrapt in profound meditation. He was called, in mockery, the great dumb ox of Sicily. Albert questioned the mute disciple on the most deep and knotty points of theology; he found, as he confessed, his equal, his superior. ‘That dumb ox will make the world resound with his doctrines.’ With Albert the faithful disciple returned to Cologne. Again he went back to Paris, received his academic degrees, and taught with universal wonder. Under Alexander <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> he stood up in Rome in defence of his Order against the eloquent William de <abbr>St.</abbr> Amour; he repudiated for his Order, and condemned by his authority, the prophesies of the Abbot Joachim. He taught at Cologne with Albert the Great; also at Paris, at Rome, at Orvieto, at Viterbo, at Perugia. Where he taught, the world listened in respectful silence. He was acknowledged by two Popes, Urban <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> and Clement <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span>, as the first theologian of the age. He refused the Archbishopric of Naples. He was expected at the Council of Lyons, as the authority before whom all Christendom might be expected to bow down. He died ere he had passed the borders of Naples, at the Abbey of Rossa Nuova, near Terracina, at the age of forty-eight. Dark tales were told of his death; only the wickedness of man could deprive the world so early of such a wonder. The University of Paris claimed, but in vain, the treasure of his mortal remains.

						<p>“Thomas Aquinas is throughout, above all, the Theologian. God and the soul of man are the only objects truly worthy of his philosophic investigation. This is the function of the Angelic Doctor, the mission of the Angel of the Schools. In his works, or rather in his one great work, is the final result of all which has been decided by Pope or Council, taught by the Fathers, accepted by tradition, argued in the schools, inculcated in the confessional. The Sum of Theology is the authentic, authoritative, acknowledged code of Latin Christianity. We cannot but contrast this vast work with the original Gospel: to this bulk has grown the New Testament, or rather the doctrinal and moral part of the New Testament. But Aquinas is an intellectual theologian: he approaches more nearly than most philosophers, certainly than most divines, to pure embodied intellect. He is perfectly passionless; he has no polemic indignation, nothing of the Churchman’s jealousy and suspicion; he has no fear of the result of any investigation; he hates nothing, hardly heresy; loves nothing, unless perhaps naked, abstract truth. In his serene confidence that all must end in good, he moves the most startling and even perilous questions, as if they were the most indifferent, the very Being of God. God must be revealed by syllogistic process. Himself inwardly conscious of the absolute harmony of his own intellectual and moral being, he places sin not so much in the will as in the understanding. The perfection of man is the perfection of his intelligence. He examines with the same perfect self-command, it might almost be said apathy, the converse as well as the proof of the most vital religious truths. He is nearly as consummate a sceptic, almost atheist, as he is a divine and theologian. Secure, as it should seem, in impenetrable armor, he has not only no apprehension, but seems not to suppose the possibility of danger; he has nothing of the boastfulness of self-confidence, but, in calm assurance of victory, gives every advantage to his adversary. On both sides of every question he casts the argument into one of his clear, distinct syllogisms, and calmly places himself as Arbiter, and passes judgment in one or a series of still more unanswerable syllogisms. He has assigned its unassailable province to Church authority, to tradition or the Fathers, faith and works; but beyond, within the proper sphere of philosophy, he asserts full freedom. There is no Father, even <abbr>St.</abbr> Augustine, who may not be examined by the fearless intellect.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Peter the Lombard was born near Novara, the native place of Lanfranc and of Anselm. He was Bishop of Paris in 1159. His famous Book of the Sentences was intended to be, and became to a great extent, the Manual of the Schools. Peter knew not, or disdainfully threw aside, the philosophical cultivation of his day. He adhered rigidly to all which passed for Scripture, and was the authorized interpretation of the Scripture, to all which had become the creed in the traditions, and law in the decretals, of the Church. He seems to have no apprehension of doubt in his stern dogmatism; he will not recognize any of the difficulties suggested by philosophy; he cannot, or will not, perceive the weak points of his own system. He has the great merit that, opposed as he was to the prevailing Platonism, throughout the Sentences the ethical principle predominates; his excellence is perspicuity, simplicity, definiteness of moral purpose. His distinctions are endless, subtle, idle; but he wrote from conflicting authorities to reconcile writers at war with each other, at war with themselves. Their quarrels had been wrought to intentional or unintentional antagonism in the ‘Sic et Non’ of Abelard. That philosopher, whether Pyrrhonist or more than Pyrrhonist, had left them all in the confusion of strife; he had set Fathers against Fathers, each Father against himself, the Church against the Church, tradition against tradition, law against law. The Lombard announced himself and was accepted as the mediator, the final arbiter in this endless litigation; he would sternly fix the positive, proscribe the negative or sceptical view in all these questions. The litigation might still go on, but within the limits which he had rigidly established; he had determined those ultimate results against which there was no appeal. The mode of proof might be interminably contested in the schools; the conclusion was already irrefragably fixed. On the sacramental system Peter the Lombard is loftily, severely hierarchical. Yet he is moderate on the power of the keys; he holds only a declaratory power of binding and loosing⁠—of showing how the souls of men were to be bound and loosed.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Peter Lombard was born at the beginning of the twelfth century, when the Novarese territory, his birthplace, was a part of Lombardy, and hence his name. He studied at the University of Paris, under Abelard; was afterwards made Professor of Theology in the University, and then Bishop of Paris.

There was living in the West, by happy coincidence, the one man who at that period, by his knowledge of Greek, by the congenial speculativeness of his mind, by the vigor and richness of his imagination, was qualified to translate into Latin the mysterious doctrines of the Areopagite, both as to the angelic world and the subtle theology.

					<p>Severinus Boethius, the Roman Senator and philosopher in the days of Theodoric the Goth, born in 475, and put to death in 524. His portrait is thus drawn by Gibbon, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decline and Fall</i>, <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXXIX</span>:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Senator Boethius is the last of the Romans whom Cato or Tully could have acknowledged for their countryman. As a wealthy orphan, he inherited the patrimony and honors of the Anician family, a name ambitiously assumed by the kings and emperors of the age; and the appellation of Manlius asserted his genuine or fabulous descent from a race of consuls and dictators, who had repulsed the Gauls from the Capitol, and sacrificed their sons to the discipline of the Republic. In the youth of Boethius, the studies of Rome were not totally abandoned; a Virgil is now extant, corrected by the hand of a consul; and the professors of grammar, rhetoric, and jurisprudence were maintained in their privileges and pensions by the liberality of the Goths. But the erudition of the Latin language was insufficient to satiate his ardent curiosity; and Boethius is said to have employed eighteen laborious years in the schools of Athens, which were supported by the zeal, the learning, and the diligence of Proclus and his disciples. The reason and piety of their Roman pupil were fortunately saved from the contagion of mystery and magic, which polluted the groves of the Academy; but he imbibed the spirit, and imitated the method of his dead and living masters, who attempted to reconcile the strong and subtle sense of Aristotle with the devout contemplation and sublime fancy of Plato. After his return to Rome, and his marriage with the daughter of his friend, the patrician Symmachus, Boethius still continued in a palace of ivory and marble to prosecute the same studies. The Church was edified by his profound defence of the orthodox creed against the Arian, the Eutychian, and the Nestorian heresies; and the Catholic unity was explained or exposed in a formal treatise by the <em>indifference</em> of three distinct, though consubstantial persons. For the benefit of his Latin readers, his genius submitted to teach the first elements of the arts and sciences of Greece. The geometry of Euclid, the music of Pythagoras, the arithmetic of Nicomachus, the mechanics of Archimedes, the astronomy of Ptolemy, the theology of Plato, and the logic of Aristotle, with the commentary of Porphyry, were translated and illustrated by the indefatigable pen of the Roman Senator. And he alone was esteemed capable of describing the wonders of art, a sundial, a water-clock, or a sphere which represented the motions of the planets. From these abstruse speculations Boethius stooped, or, to speak more truly, he rose to the social duties of public and private life: the indigent were relieved by his liberality; and his eloquence, which flattery might compare to the voice of Demosthenes or Cicero, was uniformly exerted in the cause of innocence and humanity. Such conspicuous merit was felt and rewarded by a discerning prince; the dignity of Boethius was adorned with the titles of Consul and Patrician, and his talents were usefully employed in the important station of Master of the Offices.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Being suspected of some participation in a plot against Theodoric, he was confined in the tower of Pavia, where he wrote the work which has immortalized his name. Of this Gibbon speaks as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“While Boethius, oppressed with fetters, expected each moment the sentence or the stroke of death, he composed in the tower of Pavia the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Consolation of Philosophy</i>; a golden volume not unworthy of the leisure of Plato or Tully, but which claims incomparable merit from the barbarism of the times and the situation of the author. The celestial guide whom he had so long invoked at Rome and Athens now condescended to illumine his dungeon, to revive his courage, and to pour into his wounds her salutary balm. She taught him to compare his long prosperity and his recent distress, and to conceive new hopes from the inconstancy of fortune. Reason had informed him of the precarious condition of her gifts; experience had satisfied him of their real value; he had enjoyed them without guilt; he might resign them without a sigh, and calmly disdain the impotent malice of his enemies, who had left him happiness, since they had left him virtue. From the earth Boethius ascended to heaven in search of the <b>Supreme Good</b>; explored the metaphysical labyrinth of chance and destiny, of prescience and freewill, of time and eternity; and generously attempted to reconcile the perfect attributes of the Deity with the apparent disorders of his moral and physical government. Such topics of consolation, so obvious, so vague, or so abstruse, are ineffectual to subdue the feelings of human nature. Yet the sense of misfortune may be diverted by the labor of thought; and the sage who could artfully combine, in the same work, the various riches of philosophy, poetry, and eloquence, must already have possessed the intrepid calmness which he affected to seek. Suspense, the worst of evils, was at length determined by the ministers of death, who executed, and perhaps exceeded, the inhuman mandate of Theodoric. A strong cord was fastened round the head of Boethius, and forcibly tightened, till his eyes almost started from their sockets; and some mercy may be discovered in the milder torture of beating him with clubs till he expired. But his genius survived to diffuse a ray of knowledge over the darkest ages of the Latin world; the writings of the philosopher were translated by the most glorious of the English kings, and the third Emperor of the name of Otho removed to a more honorable tomb the bones of a Catholic saint, who, from his Arian persecutors, had acquired the honors of martyrdom, and the fame of miracles.”</p>

On his deathbed he dictated the close of his translation of the Gospel of John. “Dearest master,” said his scribe, “one chapter still remains, but it is difficult for thee to speak.” The dying monk replied, “Take thy pen and write quickly.” Later the scribe said, “Only one sentence remains”; and the monk said again, “Write quickly.” And writing, the scribe said, “It is done.” “Thou hast said rightly,” answered Bede, “it is done”; and died, repeating the “Gloria Patri,” closing the service of his long life with the closing words of the service of the Church.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The reputation of Bede increased daily, and we find him spoken of by the title of Saint very soon after his death. Boniface in his epistles describes him as the lamp of the Church. Towards the ninth century he received the appellation of The Venerable, which has ever since been attached to his name. As a specimen of the fables by which his biography was gradually obscured, we may cite the legends invented to account for the origin of this latter title. According to one, the Anglo-Saxon scholar was on a visit to Rome, and there saw a gate of iron, on which were inscribed the letters <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">P.P.P.S.S.S.R.R.R.F.F.F.</abbr>, which no one was able to interpret. Whilst Bede was attentively considering the inscription, a Roman who was passing by said to him rudely, ‘What seest thou there, English ox?’ to which Bede replied, ‘I see your confusion’; and he immediately explained the characters thus: <i xml:lang="la">Pater Patrice Perditus, Sapientia Secum Sublata, Ruef Regnum Romae, Ferro Flamma Fame</i>. The Romans were astonished at the acuteness of their English visitor, and decreed that the title of Venerable should be thenceforth given to him. According to another story, Bede, having become blind in his old age, was walking abroad with one of his disciples for a guide, when they arrived at an open place where there was a large heap of stones; and Bede’s companion persuaded his master to preach to the people who, as he pretended, were assembled there and waiting in great silence and expectation. Bede delivered a most eloquent and moving discourse, and when he had uttered the concluding phrase, <i xml:lang="la">Per omnia saecula saeculorum</i>, to the great admiration of his disciple, the stones, we are told, cried out aloud, ‘Amen, Venerabilis Beda!’ There is also a third legend on this subject which informs us that, soon after Bede’s death, one of his disciples was appointed to compose an epitaph in Latin Leonines, and carve it on his monument, and he began thus,</p>

					<p class="continued">Others derive the name from the fact, that the students covered the benches of their lecture-rooms with straw, or used it instead of benches; which they would not have done if a straw-market had not been near at hand.</p>
					<p>Dante, moved perhaps by some pleasant memory of the past, pays the old scholastic street the tribute of a verse. The elegant Petrarca mentions it frequently in his Latin writings, and always with a sneer. He remembers only “the disputatious city of Paris, and the noisy Street of Straw”; or “the plaudits of the Petit Pont and the Rue du Fouarre, the most famous places on earth.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“A common idealist would have been rather alarmed at the thought of introducing the name of a street in Paris⁠—Straw Street (Rue du Fouarre)⁠—into the midst of a description of the highest heavens.⁠ ⁠… What did it matter to Dante, up in heaven there, whether the mob below thought him vulgar or not! Sigier <em>had</em> read in Straw Street; that was the fact, and he had to say so, and there an end.</p>
						<p>“There is, indeed, perhaps, no greater sign of innate and <em>real</em> vulgarity of mind or defective education, than the want of power to understand the universality of the ideal truth; the absence of sympathy with the colossal grasp of those intellects, which have in them so much of divine, that nothing is small to them, and nothing large; but with equal and unoffended vision they take in the sum of the world, Straw Street and the seventh heavens, in the same instant. A certain portion of this divine spirit is visible even in the lower examples of all the true men; it is, indeed, perhaps the clearest test of their belonging to the true and great group, that they are continually touching what to the multitude appear vulgarities. The higher a man stands, the more the word ‘vulgar’ becomes unintelligible to him.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The following sketch from the note book of a recent traveller shows the Street of Straw in its present condition:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“I went yesterday in search of the Rue du Fouarre. I had been hearing William Guizot’s lecture on Montaigne, and from the Collége de France went down the Rue <abbr>St.</abbr> Jacques, passing at the back of the old church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Severin, whose gargoyles still stretch out their long necks over the street. Turning into the Rue Galande, a few steps brought me to the Fouarre. It is a short and narrow street, with a scanty footway on one side, on the other only a gutter. The opening at the farther end is filled by a picturesque vista of the transept gable and great rose-window of Notre Dame, over the river, with the slender central spire. Some of the houses on either side of the street were evidently of a comparatively modern date; but others were of the oldest, and the sculptured stone wreaths over the doorways, and the remains of artistic ironwork in the balconies, showed them to have been once of some consideration. Some dirty children were playing at the door of a shop where fagots and <i xml:lang="fr">charbon de terre de Paris</i> were sold. A coachman in glazed hat sat asleep on his box before the shop of a <i xml:lang="fr">blanchisseuse de fin</i>. A woman in a bookbinder’s window was folding the sheets of a French grammar. In an angle of the houses under the high wall of the hospital garden was a cobbler’s stall. A stout, red-faced woman, standing before it, seeing me gazing round, asked if Monsieur was seeking anything in special. I said I was only looking at the old street; it must be very old. ‘Yes, one of the oldest in Paris.’ ‘And why is it called “<i xml:lang="fro">du Fouarre</i>”?’ ‘O, that is the old French for <i xml:lang="fr">foin</i>; and hay used to be sold here. Then, there were famous schools here in the old days; Abelard used to lecture here.’ I was delighted to find the traditions of the place still surviving, though I cannot say whether she was right about Abelard, whose name may have become merely typical; it is not improbable, however, that he may have made and annihilated many a man of straw, after the fashion of the doctors of dialectics, in the Fouarre. His house was not far off on the Quai Napoléon in the Cité; and that of the Canon Fulbert on the corner of the Rue Basse des Ursins. Passing through to the Pont au Double, I stopped to look at the books on the parapet, and found a voluminous Dictionnaire Historique, but, oddly enough, it contained neither Sigier’s name, nor Abelard’s. I asked a ruddy-cheeked boy on a doorstep if he went to school. He said he worked in the daytime, and went to an evening school in the Rue du Fouarre, <abbr>No.</abbr> 5. That primary night school seems to be the last feeble descendant of the ancient learning. As to straw, I saw none except a kind of rude straw matting placed round the corner of a wine-shop at the entrance of the street; a sign that oysters are sold within, they being brought to Paris in this kind of matting.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the seal of the living God.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="continued">These words Bonaventura applies to <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis, the beautiful enthusiast and <em>Pater Seraphicus</em> of the Church, to follow out whose wonderful life through the details of history and legend would be too long for these notes. A few hints must suffice.</p>
					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Francis was the son of Peter Bernadone, a wool-merchant of Assisi, and was-born in 1182. The first glimpse we catch of him is that of a joyous youth in gay apparel, given up to pleasure, and singing with his companions through the streets of his native town, like <abbr>St.</abbr> Augustine in the streets of Carthage. He was in the war between Assisi and Perugia, was taken prisoner, and passed a year in confinement. On his return home a severe illness fell upon him, which gave him more serious thoughts. He again appeared in the streets of Assisi in gay apparel, but meeting a beggar, a fellow-soldier, he changed clothes with him. He now began to visit hospitals and kiss the sores of lepers. He prayed in the churches, and saw visions. In the church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Damiano he heard a voice say three times, “Francis, repair my house, which thou seest falling.” In order to do this, he sold his father’s horse and some cloth at Foligno, and took the money to the priest of <abbr>St.</abbr> Damiano, who to his credit refused to receive it. Through fear of his father, he hid himself; and when he reappeared in the streets was so ill-clad that the boys pelted him and called him mad. His father shut him up in his house; his mother set him free. In the presence of his father and the Bishop he renounced all right to his inheritance, even giving up his clothes, and putting on those of a servant which the Bishop gave him. He wandered about the country, singing the praises of the Lord aloud on the highways. He met with a band of robbers, and said to them, “I am the herald of the Great King.” They beat him and threw him into a ditch filled with snow. He only rejoiced and sang the louder. A friend in Gubbio gave him a suit of clothes, which he wore for two years, with a girdle and a staff. He washed the feet of lepers in the hospital, and kissed their sores. He begged from door to door in Assisi for the repairs of the church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Damiano, and carried stones for the masons. He did the same for the church of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter; he did the same for the church of Our Lady of Angels at Portiuncula, in the neighborhood of Assisi, where he remained two years. Hearing one day in church the injunction of Christ to his Apostles, “Provide neither gold nor silver, nor brass in your purse, nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes, nor yet staves,” he left off shoes and staff and girdle, and girt himself with a cord, after the manner of the shepherds in that neighborhood. This cord became the distinguishing mark of his future Order. He kissed the ulcer of a man from Spoleto, and healed him; and <abbr>St.</abbr> Bonaventura says, “I know not which I ought most to admire, such a kiss or such a cure.” Bernard of Quintavalle and others associated themselves with him, and the Order of the Benedictines was founded.</p>
					<p>As his convent increased, so did his humility and his austerities. He sewed his rough habit with packthread to make it rougher; he slept on the ground with a stone for his pillow; he drank water; he ate bread; he fasted eight lents in the year; he called his body “Brother Ass,” and bound it with a halter, the cord of his Order; but a few days before his death he begged pardon of his body for having treated it so harshly. As a penance, he rolled himself naked in the snow and among brambles; he commanded his friars to revile him, and when he said, “O Brother Francis, for thy sins thou hast deserved to be plunged into hell”; Brother Leo was to answer, “It is true; thou hast deserved to be buried in the very bottom of hell.”</p>
					<p>In 1215 his convent was removed to Alvernia, among the solitudes of the Apennines. In 1219 he went to Egypt to convert the Sultan, and preached to him in his camp near Damietta, but without the desired effect. He returned to the duties of his convent with unabated zeal; and was sometimes seen by his followers lifted from the ground by the fervor of his prayers; and here he received in a vision of the Crucifixion the stigmata in his hands and feet and side. Butler, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Saints</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span> 100, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The marks of nails began to appear on his hands and feet, resembling those he had seen in the vision of the man crucified. His hands and feet seemed bored through in the middle with four wounds, and these holes appeared to be pierced with nails of hard flesh; the heads were round and black, and were seen in the palms of his hands, and in his feet in the upper part of the instep. The points were long, and appeared beyond the skin on the other side, and were turned back as if they had been clenched with a hammer. There was also in his right side a red wound, as if made by the piercing of a lance; and this often threw out blood, which stained the tunic and drawers of the saint.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Two years afterwards <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis died, exclaiming, “Welcome, Sister Death”; and multitudes came to kiss his sacred wounds. His body was buried in the church of <abbr>St.</abbr> George at Assisi, but four years afterwards removed to a church outside the walls. See <a href="#note-1483">note 1483</a>.</p>
					<p>In the life of <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between the facts of history and the myths of tradition; but through all we see the outlines of a gentle, beautiful, and noble character. All living creatures were his brothers and sisters. To him the lark was an emblem of the Cherubim, and the lamb an image of the Lamb of God. He is said to have preached to the birds; and his sermon was, “Brother birds, greatly are ye bound to praise the Creator, who clotheth you with feathers, and giveth you wings to fly with, and a purer air to breathe, and who careth for you, who have so little care for yourselves.”</p>
					<p>Forsyth, describing his visit to La Verna, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Italy</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 123, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Francis appears to me a genuine hero, original, independent, magnanimous, incorruptible. His powers seemed designed to regenerate society; but, taking a wrong direction, they sank men into beggars.”</p>

After many other proofs of the sincere and admirable sanctity of Francis, being charmed and vanquished by his example, he begged the saint to make him his companion. Francis recommended the matter to God for some time; they both heard mass together, and took advice that they might learn the will of God. The design being approved, Bernard sold all his effects, and divided the sum among the poor in one day.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Brother Giles said, ‘Can a dull idiot love God as perfectly as a great scholar?’ <abbr>St.</abbr> Bonaventure replied, ‘A poor old woman may love him more than the most learned master and doctor in theology.’ At this Brother Giles, in a sudden fervor and jubilation of spirit, went into a garden, and, standing at a gate toward the city (of Rome), he looked that way, and cried out with a loud voice, ‘Come, the poorest, most simple, and most illiterate old woman, love the Lord our God, and you may attain to an higher degree of eminence and happiness than Brother Bonaventure with all his learning.’ After this he fell into an ecstasy, in which he continued in sweet contemplation without motion for the space of three hours.”</p>

Sylvester, smitten with remorse that he, an old man, should be so greedy of gold, while a young man despised it for the love of God, soon after became a disciple of the saint. <a href="paradiso.xhtml#noteref-1468" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Dominic, Founder of the Preaching Friars, and Persecutor of Heretics, was born in the town of Calaroga, now Calahorra, in Old Castile, in the year 1170, and died in Bologna in 1221. He was of the illustrious family of the Guzmans; in his youth he studied ten years at the University of Palencia; was devout, abstemious, charitable; sold his clothes to feed the poor, and even offered to sell himself to the Moors, to ransom the brother of a poor woman who sought his aid. In his twenty-fifth year he became a canon under the Bishop of Osma, preaching in the various churches of the province for nine years, and at times teaching theology at Palencia. In 1203 he accompanied his Bishop on a diplomatic mission to Denmark; and on his return stopped in Languedoc, to help root out the Albigensian heresy; but how far he authorized or justified the religious crusades against these persecuted people, and what part he took in them, is a contested point⁠—enough it would seem to obtain for him, from the Inquisition of Toulouse, the title of the Persecutor of Heretics.</p>
					<p>In 1215, <abbr>St.</abbr> Dominic founded the Order of Preaching Friars, and in the year following was made Master of the Sacred Palace at Rome.

					<p>John of Fidanza, surnamed Bonaventura⁠—who “postponed considerations sinister,” or made things temporal subservient to things spiritual, and of whom one of his teachers said that it seemed as if in him “Adam had not sinned,”⁠—was born in 1221 at Bagnoregio, near Orvieto. In his childhood, being extremely ill, he was laid by his mother at the feet of <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis, and healed by the prayers of the Saint, who, when he beheld him, exclaimed, “<i xml:lang="it">O buona ventura!</i>” and by this name the mother dedicated her son to God. He lived to become a Franciscan, to be called the “Seraphic Doctor,” and to write the Life of <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis; which, according to the Spanish legend, being left unfinished at his death, he was allowed to return to earth for three days to complete it. There is a strange picture in the Louvre, attributed to Murillo, representing this event. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Jameson gives an engraving of it in her <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Legends of the Monastic Orders</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 303.</p>
					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Bonaventura was educated in Paris under Alexander Hales, the Irrefragable Doctor, and in 1245, at the age of twenty-four, became a Professor of Theology in the University. In 1256 he was made General of his Order; in 1273, Cardinal and Bishop of Albano.

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Bonaventura was one of the great Schoolmen, and his works are voluminous, consisting of seven imposing folios, two of which are devoted to Expositions of the Scriptures, one to Sermons, two to Peter Lombard’s Book of Sentences, and two to minor works. Among these may be mentioned the Legend of <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis; the Itinerary of the Mind towards God; the Ecclesiastical Hierarchy; the Bible of the Poor, which is a volume of essays on moral and religious subjects; and Meditations on the Life of Christ. Of others the mystic titles are, The Mirror of the Soul; The Mirror of the Blessed Virgin; On the Six Wings of the Seraphim; On the Six Wings of the Cherudim; On the Sandals of the Apostles. One golden sentence of his cannot be too often repeated:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The best perfection of a religious man is to do common things in a perfect manner. A constant fidelity in small things is a great and heroic virtue.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> 274, 276, says of him:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In Bonaventura the philosopher <em>recedes</em>; religious edification is his mission. A much smaller proportion of his voluminous works is pure Scholasticism: he is teaching by the Life of his Holy Founder, <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis, and by what may be called a new Gospel, a legendary Life of the Saviour, which seems to claim, with all its wild traditions, equal right to the belief with that of the Evangelists. Bonaventura himself seems to deliver it as his own unquestioning faith. Bonaventura, if not ignorant of, feared or disdained to know much of Aristotle or the Arabians: he philosophizes only because in his age he could not avoid philosophy.⁠ ⁠… The raptures of Bonaventura, like the raptures of all Mystics, tremble on the borders of Pantheism: he would still keep up the distinction between the soul and God; but the soul must aspire to absolute unity with God, in whom all ideas are in reality one, though many according to human thought and speech. But the soul, by contemplation, by beatific vision, is, as it were, to be lost and merged in that Unity.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The mysticism of Hugo de <abbr>St.</abbr> Victor withdrew the contemplator altogether from the outward to the inner world⁠—from God in the works of nature, to God in his workings on the soul of man.

Through the Angels and the Celestial Hierarchy of the Areopagite it aspires to one God, not in his Theophany, but in his inmost essence. All ideas and forms of things are latent in the human soul, as in God, only they are manifested to the soul by its own activity, its meditative power. Yet <abbr>St.</abbr> Victor is not exempt from the grosser phraseology of the Mystic⁠—the tasting God, and other degrading images from the senses of men. The ethical system of Hugo de <abbr>St.</abbr> Victor is that of the Church, more free and lofty than the dry and barren discipline of Peter Lombard.”</p>

					<p>John, surnamed from his eloquence Chrysostom, or Golden Mouth, was born in Antioch, about the year 344.

They unanimously attribute to the Christian orator the free command of an elegant and copious language; the judgment to conceal the advantages which he derived from the knowledge of rhetoric and philosophy; an inexhaustible fund of metaphors and similitudes, of ideas and images, to vary and illustrate the most familiar topics; the happy art of engaging the passions in the service of virtue; and of exposing the folly, as well as the turpitude, of vice, almost with the truth and spirit of a dramatic representation.”</p>

					<p>This distinguished mystic and enthusiast of the twelfth century was born in 1130 at the village of Celio, near Cosenza in Calabria, on the river Busento, in whose bed the remains of Attila were buried. A part of his youth was passed at Naples, where his father held some office in the court of King Roger; but from the temptations of this gay capital he escaped, and, like <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis, renouncing the world, gave himself up to monastic life.</p>
					<p>“A tender and religious soul,” says Rousselot in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Histoire de l’Évangile Éternel</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 15, “an imagination ardent and early turned towards asceticism, led him from his first youth to embrace the monastic life. His spirit, naturally exalted, must have received the most lively impressions from the spectacle offered him by the place of his birth: mountains arid or burdened with forests, deep valleys furrowed by the waters of torrents; a soil, rough in some places, and covered in others with a brilliant vegetation; a heaven of fire; solitude, so easily found in Calabria, and so dear to souls inclined to mysticism⁠—all combined to exalt in Joachim the religious sentiment. There are places where life is naturally poetical, and when the soul, thus nourished by things external, plunges into the divine world, it produces men like <abbr>St.</abbr> Francis of Accesi and Joachim of Flora.</p>
					<p>“On leaving Naples he had resolved to embrace the monastic life, but he was unwilling to do it till he had visited the Holy Land. He started forthwith, followed by many pilgrims whose expenses he paid; and as to himself, clad in a white dress of some coarse stuff, he made a great part of the journey barefooted. In order to stop in the Thebaid, the first centre of Christian asceticism, he suffered his companions to go on before; and there he was nigh perishing from thirst. Overcome by the heat in a desert place, where he could not find a drop of water, he dug a grave in the sand, and lay down in it to die, hoping that his body, soon buried by the sand heaped up by the wind, would not fall a prey to wild beasts. Barius attributes to him a dream, in which he thought he was drinking copiously; at all events, after sleeping some hours he awoke in condition to continue his journey. After visiting Jerusalem, he went to Mount Tabor, where he remained forty days. He there lived in an old cistern; and it was amid watchings and prayers on the scene of the Transfiguration that he conceived the idea of his principal writings: ‘The Harmony of the Old and New Testaments’; ‘The Exposition of the Apocalypse’; and ‘The Psalter of Ten Strings.’ ”</p>
					<p>On his return to Italy, Joachim became a Cistercian monk in the monastery of Corazzo in Calabria, of which erelong he became Abbot; but, wishing for greater seclusion, he soon withdrew to Flora, among the mountains, where he founded another monastery, and passed the remainder of his life in study and contemplation. He died in 1202, being seventy-two years of age.</p>
					<p>“His renown was great,” says Rousselot, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Histoire de l’Évangile Éternel</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 27, “and his duties numerous; nevertheless his functions as Abbot of the monastery which he had founded did not prevent him from giving himself up to the composition of the writings which he had for a long time meditated. This was the end he had proposed to himself; it was to attain it that he had wished to live in solitude. If his desire was not wholly realized, it was so in great part; and Joachim succeeded in laying the foundations of the Eternal Gospel. He passed his days and nights in writing and in dictating. ‘I used to write,’ says his secretary Lucas, ‘day and night in copybooks, what he dictated and corrected on scraps of paper, with two other monks whom he employed in the same work.’ It was in the middle of these labors that death surprised him.”</p>
					<p>In Abbot Joachim’s time at least, this Eternal Gospel was not a book, but a doctrine, pervading all his writings. Later, in the middle of the thirteenth century, some such book existed, and was attributed to John of Parma. In the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.poem">Romance of the Rose</i>, Chaucer’s <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, 1798, it is thus spoken of:⁠—</p>

					<p>The Eternal Gospel taught that there were three epochs in the history of the world, two of which were already passed, and the third about to begin. The first was that of the Old Testament, or the reign of the Father; the second, that of the New Testament, or the reign of the Son; and the third, that of Love, or the reign of the Holy Spirit. To use his own words, as quoted by Rousselot, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Histoire de l’Évangile Éternel</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 78:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“As the letter of the Old Testament seems to belong to the Father, by a certain peculiarity of resemblance, and the letter of the New Testament to the Son; so the spiritual intelligence, which proceeds from both, belongs to the Holy Spirit. Accordingly, the age when men were joined in marriage was the reign of the Father; that of the Preachers is the reign of the Son; and the age of Monks, <i xml:lang="la">ordo monachorum</i>, the last, is to be that of the Holy Spirit. The first before the law, the second under the law, the third with grace.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The germ of this doctrine, says the same authority, <abbr>p.</abbr> 59, is in Origen, who had said before the Abbot Joachim:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“We must leave to believers the historic Christ and the Gospel, the Gospel of the letter; but to the Gnostics alone belongs the Divine Word, the Eternal Gospel, the Gospel of the Spirit.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Heaven of Mars may be compared to Music, for two properties. The first is its very beautiful relation [to the others]; for, enumerating the movable heavens, from whichsoever you begin, whether from the lowest or the highest, the Heaven of Mars is the fifth; it is the centre of all.⁠ ⁠… The other is, that Mars dries up and burns things, because its heat is like to that of the fire; and this is the reason why it appears fiery in color, sometimes more, and sometimes less, according to the density and rarity of the vapors which follow it, which sometimes take fire of themselves, as is declared in the first book of <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Meteors</i>. (And therefore Albumasar says, that the ignition of these vapors signifies death of kings, and change of empires, being effects of the dominion of Mars. And accordingly Seneca says that at the death of the Emperor Augustus a ball of fire was seen in the heavens. And in Florence, at the beginning of its downfall, a great quantity of these vapors, which follow Mars, were seen in the air in the form of a cross.) And these two properties are in Music, which is wholly relative, as may be seen in harmonized words, and in songs, in which the more beautiful the relation, the sweeter the harmony, since such is chiefly its intent. Also Music attracts to itself the spirits of men, which are principally as it were vapors of the heart, so that they almost cease from any operation; so entire is the soul when it listens, and the power of all as it were runs to the sensible spirit that hears the sounds.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of the influences of Mars, Buti, as usual following Albumasar, writes:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Its nature is hot, igneous, dry, choleric, of a bitter savor, and it signifies youth, strength, and acuteness of mind; heats, fires, and burnings, and every sudden event; powerful kings, consuls, dukes, and knights, and companies of soldiery; desire of praise and memory of one’s name; strategies and instruments of battle; robberies and machinations, and scattering of relations by plunderings and highway robberies; boldness and anger; the unlawful for the lawful; torments and imprisonments; scourges and bonds; anguish, flight, thefts, pilfering of servants, fears, contentions, insults, acuteness of mind, impiety, inconstancy, want of foresight, celerity and anticipation in things, evil eloquence and ferocity of speech, foulness of words, incontinence of tongue, demonstrations of love, gay apparel, insolence and falseness of words, swiftness of reply and sudden penitence therefor, want of religion, unfaithfulness to promises, multitude of lies and whisperings, deceits and perjuries; machinations and evil deeds; want of means; waste of means; multitude of thoughts about things; instability and change of opinion in things, from one to another; haste to return; want of shame; multitude of toils and cares; peregrinations, solitary existence, bad company;⁠ ⁠… breaking open of tombs, and spoliations of the dead.”</p>

I think they took this from the fable of Phaeton, which Ovid narrates in the beginning of the second book of the Metamorphoses. Others, and among them Anaxagoras and Democritus, that it was the light of the Sun reflected in that part. And these opinions they prove by demonstrative reasons. What Aristotle says of this we cannot well know; for his opinion is not the same in one translation as in the other. And I think this was an error of the translators; for in the new one he appears to say, that it was a gathering of vapors under the stars of that region, for they always attract them; and this does not appear to be the true reason. In the old, it says, that the Galaxy is only a multitude of fixed stars in that region, so small that they cannot be distinguished here below; but from them is apparent that whiteness which we call the Galaxy. And it may be that the heaven in that part is more dense, and therefore retains and reflects that light; and this opinion seems to have been entertained by Aristotle, Avicenna, and Ptolemy.”</p>

					<p>The sign of the cross, drawn upon the planet Mars, as upon the breast of a crusader. The following Legend of the Cross, and its significance, is from Didron, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Christian Iconography</i>, Millington’s <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 367:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The cross is more than a mere figure of Christ; it is in Iconography either Christ himself or his symbol. A legend has, consequently, been invented, giving the history of the cross, as if it had been a living being. It has been made the theme and hero of an epic poem, the germ of which may be discovered in books of apocryphal tradition. This story is given at length in the Golden Legend, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="la">Legenda Aurea</i>, and is detailed and completed in works of painting and sculpture from the fourteenth century down to the sixteenth.⁠ ⁠… After the death of Adam, Seth planted on the tomb of his father a shoot from the Tree of Life, which grew in the terrestrial Paradise. From it sprang three little trees, united by one single trunk. Moses thence gathered the rod with which he by his miracles astonished the people of Egypt, and the inhabitants of the desert. Solomon desired to convert that same tree, which had become gigantic in size, into a column for his palace; being either too short or too long, it was rejected, and served as a bridge over a torrent. The Queen of Sheba refused to pass over on that tree, declaring that it would one day occasion the destruction of the Jews. Solomon commanded that the predestined beam should be thrown into the probationary pool (Pool of Bethesda), and its virtues were immediately communicated to the waters. When Christ had been condemned to suffer the death of a malefactor, his cross was made of the wood of that very tree. It was buried on Golgotha, and afterwards discovered by <abbr>St.</abbr> Helena. It was carried into captivity by Chosroes, king of Persia, delivered, and brought back in triumph to Jerusalem, by the Emperor Heraclius. Being afterwards dispersed in a multitude of fragments throughout the Christian universe, countless miracles were performed by it; it restored the dead to life, and gave sight to the blind, cured the paralytic, cleansed lepers, put demons to flight, and dispelled various maladies with which whole nations were afflicted, extinguished conflagrations, and calmed the fury of the raging waves.</p>
						<p>“The wood of the cross was born with the world, in the terrestrial paradise; it will reappear in heaven at the end of time, borne in the arms of Christ or of his angels, when the Lord descends to judge the world at the last day.</p>
						<p>“After reading this history, some conception may be formed of the important place held by the cross in Christian Iconography. The cross, as has been said, is not merely the instrument of the punishment of Jesus Christ, but is also the figure and symbol of the Saviour. Jesus, to an Iconologist, is present in the cross as well as in the lamb, or in the lion. Chosroes flattered himself that, in possessing the cross, he possessed the Son of God, and he had it enthroned on his right hand, just as the Son is enthroned by God the Father. So also the earliest Christian artists, when making a representation of the Trinity, placed a cross beside the Father and the Holy Spirit; a cross only, without our crucified Lord. The cross did not only recall Christ to mind, but actually showed him. In Christian Iconography, Christ is actually present under the form and semblance of the cross.</p>
						<p>“The cross is our crucified Lord in person. Where the cross is, there is the martyr, says <abbr>St.</abbr> Paulinus. Consequently it works miracles, as does Jesus himself: and the list of wonders operated by its power is in truth immense.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“The world is in the form of a cross; for the east shines above our heads, the north is on the right, the south at the left, and the west stretches out beneath our feet. Birds, that they may rise in air, extend their wings in the form of a cross; men, when praying, or when beating aside the water while swimming, assume the form of a cross. Man differs from the inferior animals, in his power of standing erect, and extending his arms.</p>
						<p>“A vessel, to fly upon the seas, displays her yardarms in the form of a cross, and cannot cut the waves, unless her mast stands cross-like, erect in air; finally, the ground cannot be tilled without the sacred sign, and the <em>tau</em>, the cruciform letter, is the letter of salvation.</p>
						<p>“The cross, it is thus seen, has been the object of a worship and adoration resembling, if not equal to, that offered to Christ. That sacred tree is adored almost as if it were equal with God himself; a number of churches have been dedicated to it under the name of the Holy Cross. In addition to this, most of our churches, the greatest as well as the smallest, cathedrals as well as chapels, present in their ground plan the form of a cross.”</p>

						<p>“In the Pythagorean doctrine, number comprises within itself two species⁠—odd and even; it is therefore the unity of these two contraries; it is the odd and the even. Now the Pythagoreans said also that one, or the unit, is the odd and the even; and thus we arrive at this result, that one, or the unit, is the essence of number, or number absolutely. As such, it is also the ground of all numbers, and is therefore named the first one, of whose origin nothing further can be said. In this respect the Pythagorean theory of numbers is merely an expression for ‘all is from the original one,’⁠—from one being, to which they also gave the name of God; for in the words of Philolaus, ‘God embraces and actuates all, and is but one.’⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“But in the essence of number, or in the first original one, all other numbers, and consequently the elements of numbers, and the elements of the whole world, and all nature, are contained. The elements of number are the even and the odd; on this account the first one is the even-odd, which the Pythagoreans, in their occasionally strained mode of symbolizing, attempted to prove thus; that one being added to the even makes odd, and to the odd, even.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The name of Florence has been variously explained. With the old chroniclers the prevalent opinion was, that it was derived from <i xml:lang="it">Fiorino</i>, the Praetor of Metellus, who during the long siege of Fiesole by the Romans commanded an intrenched camp between the River and the Rock, and was here surprised and slain by the enemy. The meadows abounded in flowers, especially lilies, and the ancient ensign, a white lily on a red ground, subsequently reversed (<span epub:type="z3998:roman">XVI</span> 154), and similar to the form on the florin (<i xml:lang="it">fiorino</i>), with the name given to the Duomo, <abbr>St.</abbr> Maria del Fiore, tend to show that the name was taken from the flowery mead, rather than from the name of a Roman praetor. Leonardo Aretino states that the name of the city originally was <i xml:lang="it">Fluentia</i>, so called because situated between the Arno and the Mugnone: and that subsequently, from the flourishing state of the colony, it was called <i xml:lang="it">Florentia</i>. Scipione Ammirato affirms that its name from the first was <i xml:lang="it">Florenzia</i>.</p>
						<p>“The form and dimensions of the original city have not been very accurately recorded, In shape, probably, it resembled a Roman camp. Malespini says that it was ‘<i xml:lang="co">quasi a similitudine di bastie</i>.’ The wall was of burnt bricks, with solid round towers at intervals of twenty cubits, and it had four gates, and six posterns. The Campidoglio, where now is the Mercato Vecchio, was an imitation of that of the parent city, Rome, whose fortunes her daughter for many centuries shared.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“The <i xml:lang="co">cerchia antica</i> of Cacciaguida was the first circle of the new city, which arose from the ruins of the Roman one destroyed by Totila; it included the Badia, which the former did not; Dante, therefore, in mentioning this circumstance, shows how accurately he had informed himself of the course of the previous wall. The walls of Dante’s time were begun in 1284, but not finished until nine years after his death; they are those of the present day.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The simplicity of Florentine manners in 1260, described by Villani and Malespini, justifies a similar picture as drawn by their great poet. ‘Then,’ say these writers, ‘the Florentines lived soberly on the simplest food at little expense; many of their customs were rough and rude, and both men and women went coarsely clad; many even wearing plain leather garments without fur or lining: they wore boots on their feet and caps on their head: the women used unornamented buskins, and even the most distinguished were content with a close gown of scarlet serge or camlet, confined by a leathern waist-belt of the ancient fashion, and a hooded cloak lined with miniver; and the poorer classes wore a coarse green cloth dress of the same form. A hundred lire was the common dowry of a girl, and two and three hundred were then considered splendid fortunes: most young women waited until they were twenty years old and upwards before they married. And such was the dress, and such the manners and simple habits of the Florentines of that day; but loyal in heart, faithful to each other, zealous and honest in the execution of public duties; and with their coarse and homely mode of life they gained more virtue and honor for themselves and their country than they who now live so delicately are able to accomplish.’ ”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>What Florence had become in Dante’s time may be seen from the following extract from Frate Francesco Pippino, who wrote in 1313, and whose account is thus given by Napier, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 542:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Now indeed, in the present luxurious age, many shameful practices are introduced instead of the former customs; many indeed to the injury of people’s minds, because frugality is exchanged for magnificence; the clothing being now remarkable for its exquisite materials, workmanship, and superfluous ornaments of silver, gold, and pearls; admirable fabrics; wide-spreading embroidery; silk for vests, painted or variously colored, and lined with divers precious furs from foreign countries. Excitement to gluttony is not wanting; foreign wines are much esteemed, and almost all the people drink in public. The viands are sumptuous; the chief cooks are held in great honor; provocatives of the palate are eagerly sought after; ostentation increases; moneymakers exert themselves to supply these tastes; hence usuries, frauds, rapine, extortion, pillage, and contentions in the commonwealth: also unlawful taxes; oppression of the innocent; banishment of citizens, and the combinations of rich men. Our true god is our belly; we adhere to the pomps which were renounced at our baptism, and thus desert to the great enemy of our race. Well indeed does Seneca, the instructor of morals, in his book of orations, curse our times in the following words: ‘Daily, things grow worse because the whole contest is for dishonorable matters. Behold! the indolent senses of youth are numbed, nor are they active in the pursuit of any one honest thing. Sleep, languor, and a carefulness for bad things, worse than sleep and languor, have seized upon their minds; the love of singing, dancing, and other unworthy occupations possesses them: they are effeminate: to soften the hair, to lower the tone of their voice to female compliments; to vie with women in effeminacy of person, and adorn themselves with unbecoming delicacy, is the object of our youth.’ ”</p>

					<p>Montemalo, or Montemario, is the hill from which the traveller coming from Viterbo first catches sight of Rome. The Uccellatojo is the hill from which the traveller coming from Bologna first catches sight of Florence. Here the two hills are used to signify what is seen from them; namely, the two cities; and Dante means to say, that Florence had not yet surpassed Rome in the splendor of its buildings; but as Rome would one day be surpassed by Florence in its rise, so would it be in its downfall.</p>

Sacred architecture of every kind partook of this taste; and there was no popular citizen or nobleman but either had built or was building fine country palaces and villas, far exceeding their city residence in size and magnificence; so that many were accounted crazy for their extravagance.</p>
						<p>“ ‘And so magnificent was the sight’ says Villani, ‘that strangers unused to Florence, on coming from abroad, when they beheld the vast assemblage of rich buildings and beautiful palaces with which the country was so thickly studded for three miles round the ramparts, believed that all was city like that within the Roman walls; and this was independent of the rich palaces, towers, courts, and walled gardens at a greater distance, which in other countries would be denominated castles. In short,’ he continues, ‘it is estimated that within a circuit of six miles round the town there are rich and noble dwellings enough to make two cities like Florence.’ And Ariosto seems to have caught the same idea when he exclaims⁠—</p>

					<p>From the Incarnation of Christ down to his own birth, the planet Mars had returned to the sign of the Lion five hundred and eighty times, or made this number of revolutions in its orbit. Brunetto Latini, Dante’s schoolmaster, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tresor</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CXI</span>, says, that Mars “goes through all the signs in <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> years and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> month and <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XXX</span> days.” This would make Cacciaguida born long after the crusade in which he died. But Dante, who had perhaps seen the astronomical tables of King Alfonso of Castile, knew more of the matter than his schoolmaster, and was aware that the period of a revolution of Mars is less than two years. Witte, who cites these tables in his notes to this canto, says they give “686 days 22 hours and 24 minutes”; and continues: “Five hundred and eighty such revolutions give then (due regard being had to the leap-years) 1090 years and not quite four months. Cacciaguida, therefore, at the time of the Second Crusade, was in his fifty-seventh year.”</p>
					<p>Pietro di Dante (the poet’s son and commentator, and who, as Biagioli, with rather gratuitous harshness, says, was “smaller compared to his father than a point is to the universe”) assumed two years as a revolution of Mars; but as this made Cacciaguida born in 1160, twelve years after his death, he suggested the reading of “three,” instead of “thirty,” in the text, which reading was adopted by the Cruscan Academy, and makes the year of Cacciaguida’s birth 1106.</p>
					<p>But that Dante computed the revolution of Mars at less than two years is evident from a passage in the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 15, referred to by Philalethes, where he speaks of half a revolution of this planet as <i xml:lang="it">un anno quasi</i>, almost a year. The common reading of “thirty” is undoubtedly then the true one.</p>

						<p>“<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>. As already mentioned, the first rebuilding of Little Florence was divided by Quarters, that is, by four gates; and that we may the better make known the noble races and houses, which in those times, after Fiesole was destroyed, were great and powerful in Florence, we will enumerate them by the quarters where they lived.</p>
						<p>“And first those of the Porta del Duomo, which was the first fold and habitation of the new Florence, and the place where all the noble citizens resorted and met together on Sunday, and where all marriages were made, and all reconciliations, and all pomps and solemnities of the Commune.⁠ ⁠… At the Porta del Duomo lived the descendants of the Giovanni and of the Guineldi, who were the first that rebuilt the city of Florence, and from whom descended many noble families in Mugello and in Valdarno, and many in the city, who now are common people, and almost come to an end. Such were the Barucci, who lived at Santa Maria Maggiore, who are now extinct; and of their race were the Scali and Palermini. In the same quarter were also the Arrigucci, the Sizii, and the sons of Delia Tosa; and the Delia Tosa were the same race as the Bisdomini, and custodians and defenders of the bishopric; but one of them left his family at the Porta San Piero, and took to wife a lady named Delia Tosa, who had the inheritance, whence the name was derived. And there were the Delia Pressa, who lived among the Chiavaiuoli, men of gentle birth.</p>
						<p>“<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>. In the quarter of Porta San Piero were the Bisdomini, who, as above mentioned, were custodians of the bishopric; and the Alberighi, to whom belonged the church of Santa Maria Alberighi, of the house of the Donati, and now they are naught. The Rovignani were very great, and lived at the Porta San Pietro; and then came the houses of the Counts Guidi, and then of the Cerchi, and from them in the female line were born all the Counts Guidi, as before mentioned, of the daughter of good Messer Bellincion Berti; in our day all this race is extinct. The Galligari and Chiarmontesi and Ardinghi, who lived in the Orto San Michele, were very ancient; and so were the Giuochi, who now are <i xml:lang="it">popolani</i>, living at Santa Margherita; the Elisei, who likewise are now <i xml:lang="it">popolani</i>, living near the Mercato Vecchio. And in that place lived the Caponsacchi, who were nobles of Fiesole; the Donati, or Calfucci, for they were all one race, but the Calfucci are extinct; and the Delia Bella of San Martino, also become <i xml:lang="it">popolani</i>; and the Adimari, who descended from the house of Cosi, who now live at Porta Rossa, and who built Santa Maria Nipotecosa; and although they are now the principal family of that ward of Florence, in those days they were not of the oldest.</p>
						<p>“<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XII</span>. At the Porta San Pancrazio, of great rank and power were the Lamberti, descended from the Della Magna; the Ughi were very ancient, and built Santa Maria Ughi, and all the hill of Montughi belonged to them, and now they have died out; the Catellini were very ancient, and now they are forgotten. It is said that the Tieri were illegitimate descendants of theirs. The Pigli were great and noble in those times, and the Soldanieri and Vecchietti. Very ancient were the Dell’ Area, and now they are extinct; and the Migliorelli, who now are naught; and the Trinciavelli da Mosciano were very ancient.</p>
						<p>“<abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span>. In the quarter of Porta Santa Maria, which is now in the ward of San Piero Scheraggio and of Borgo, there were many powerful and ancient families. The greatest were the Uberti, whose ancestors were the Della Magna, and who lived where now stand the Piazza de’ Priori and the Palazzo del Popolo; the Fifanti, called Bogolesi, lived at the corner of Porta Santa Maria; the Galli, Cappiardi, Guidi, and Filippi, who now are nothing, were then great and powerful, and lived in the Mercato Nuovo. Likewise the Greci, to whom all the Borgo de’ Greci belonged, have now perished and passed away, except some of the race in Bologna; and the Ormanni, who lived where now stands the forementioned Palazzo del Popolo, and are now called Foraboschi. And behind San Piero Scheraggio, where are now the houses of the Petri, lived the Delia Pera, or Peruzza, and from them the postern gate there was called Porta Peruzza. Some say that the Peruzzi of the present day are of that family, but I do not affirm it. The Sacchetti, who lived in the Garbo, were very ancient; around the Mercato Nuovo the Bostichi were great people, and the Delia Sanella, and Giandonati and Infangati; great in Borgo Santi Apostoli were the Gualterotti and Importuni, who now are <i xml:lang="it">popolani</i>. The Buondelmonti were noble and ancient citizens in the rural districts, and Montebuoni was their castle, and many others in Valdigrieve; at first they lived in Oltrarno, and then came to the Borgo. The Pulci, and the Counts of Gangalandi, Ciuffagni, and Nerli of Oltrarno were at one time great and powerful, together with the Giandonati and Della Bella, named above; and from the Marquis Hugo, who built the Abbey, or Badia, of Florence, received arms and knighthood, for they were very great around him.”</p>

					<p>Five Florentine families, according to Benvenuto, bore the arms of the Marquis Hugo of Brandenburg, and received from him the titles and privileges of nobility. These were the Pulci, Nerli, Giandonati, Gangalandi, and Delia Bella.</p>
					<p>This Marquis Hugo, whom Dante here calls “the great baron,” was Viceroy of the Emperor Otho <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> in Tuscany.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“It came to pass, as it pleased God, that, while hunting in the neighborhood of Bonsollazzo, he was lost in the forest, and came, as it seemed to him, to a smithy. Finding there men swarthy and hideous, who, instead of iron, seemed to be tormenting human beings with fire and hammers, he asked the meaning of it. He was told that these were lost souls, and that to a like punishment was condemned the soul of the Marquis Hugo, on account of his worldly life, unless he repented. In great terror he commended himself to the Virgin Mary; and, when the vision vanished, remained so contrite in spirit, that, having returned to Florence, he had all his patrimony in Germany sold, and ordered seven abbeys to be built; the first of which was the Badia of Florence, in honor of Santa Maria; the second, that of Bonsollazzo, where he saw the vision.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The Marquis Hugo died on <abbr>St.</abbr> Thomas’s day, December 31, 1006, and was buried in the Badia of Florence, where every year on that day the monks, in grateful memory of him, kept the anniversary of his death with great solemnity. <a href="paradiso.xhtml#noteref-1648" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>Giano della Bella, who disguised the arms of Hugo, quartered in his own, with a fringe of gold. A nobleman by birth and education, he was by conviction a friend of the people, and espoused their cause against the nobles. By reforming the abuses of both parties, he gained the ill-will of both; and in 1294, after some popular tumult which he in vain strove to quell, went into voluntary exile, and died in France.</p>
					<p>Sismondi, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book"><abbr>Ital.</abbr> <abbr>Rep.</abbr></i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 113 (Lardner’s Cyclopaedia), gives the following succinct account of the abuses which Giano strove to reform, and of his summary manner of doing it:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The arrogance of the nobles, their quarrels, and the disturbance of the public peace by their frequent battles in the streets, had, in 1292, irritated the whole population against them. Giano della Bella, himself a noble, but sympathizing in the passions and resentment of the people, proposed to bring them to order by summary justice, and to confide the execution of it to the gonfalonier whom he caused to be elected. The Guelfs had been so long at the head of the republic, that their noble families, whose wealth had immensely increased, placed themselves above all law. Giano determined that their nobility itself should be a title of exclusion, and a commencement of punishment; a rigorous edict, bearing the title of ‘ordinance of justice,’ first designated thirty-seven Guelf families of Florence, whom it declared noble and great, and on this account excluded forever from the <em>signoria</em>; refusing them at the same time the privilege of renouncing their nobility, in order to place themselves on a footing with the other citizens. When these families troubled the public peace by battle or assassination, a summary information, or even common report, was sufficient to induce the gonfalonier to attack them at the head of the militia, raze their houses to the ground, and deliver their persons to the Podestà, to be punished according to their crimes. If other families committed the same disorders, if they troubled the state by their private feuds and outrages, the <em>signoria</em> was authorized to ennoble them, as a punishment of their crimes, in order to subject them to the same summary justice.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Dino Compagni, a contemporary of Giano, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cronica Fiorentina</i>, Book <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span>, says of him:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“He was a manly man, of great courage, and so bold that he defended those causes which others abandoned, and said those things which others kept silent, and did all in favor of justice against the guilty, and was so much feared by the magistrates that they were afraid to screen the evildoers. The great began to speak against him, threatening him, and they did it, not for the sake of justice, but to destroy their enemies, abominating him and the laws.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Villani, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Cronica</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span> ch. 8, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Giano della Bella was condemned and banished for contumacy,⁠ ⁠… and all his possessions confiscated,⁠ ⁠… whence great mischief accrued to our city, and chiefly to the people, for he was the most loyal and upright <i xml:lang="it">popolano</i> and lover of the public good of any man in Florence.”</p>

						<p>“But I shall now endeavor to demonstrate, that, in whatever way the chain of causes is disposed, the event of things which are foreseen is necessary; although prescience may not appear to be the necessitating cause of their befalling. For example, if a person sits, the opinion formed of him that he is seated, is of necessity true; but by inverting the phrase, if the opinion is true that he is seated, he must necessarily sit. In both cases then there is a necessity; in the latter, that the person sits; in the former, that the opinion concerning him is true: but the person doth not sit, because the opinion of his sitting is true; but the opinion is rather true, because the action of his being seated was antecedent in time. Thus though the truth of the opinion may be the effect of the person taking a seat, there is nevertheless a necessity common to both. The same method of reasoning, I think, should be employed with regard to the prescience of God, and future contingencies; for allowing it to be true, that events are foreseen because they are to happen, and that they do not befall because they are foreseen, it is still necessary, that what is to happen must be foreseen by God, and that what is foreseen must take place.”</p>

						<p>“But how is it possible, said I, that those things which are foreseen should not befall?⁠—I do not say, replied she, that we are to entertain any doubt but the events will take place, which Providence foresees are to happen; but we are rather to believe, that although they do happen, yet that there is no necessity in the events themselves, which constrains them to do so. The truth of which I shall thus endeavor to illustrate. We behold many things done under our view, such as a coachman conducting his chariot and governing his horses, and other things of a like nature. Now, do you suppose these things are done by the compulsion of a necessity?⁠—No, answered I; for, if everything were moved by compulsion, the effects of art would be vain and fruitless.⁠—If things then, which are doing under our eye, added she, are under no present necessity of happening, it must be admitted that these same things, before they befell, were under no necessity of taking place. It is plain, therefore, that some things befall, the event of which is altogether unconstrained by necessity. For I do not think any person will say that such things as are at present done, were not to happen before they were done. Why, therefore, may not things be foreseen, and not necessitated in their events? As the knowledge then of what is present imposes no necessity on things now done, so neither does the foreknowledge of what is to happen in future necessitate the things which are to take place.”</p>

He was the chief captain of the Ghibellines, and his court the refuge of some of the principal of the exiles. Dante was there in 1317 with Guido da Castello and Uguccione della Faggiuola. To Can Grande he dedicated some cantos of the Paradiso, and presented them with that long Latin letter so difficult to associate with the name of Dante.</p>
					<p>At this time the court of Verona seems to have displayed a kind of barbaric splendor and magnificence, as if in imitation of the gay court of Frederick <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> of Sicily.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“Can Grande gathered around him those distinguished personages whom unfortunate reverses had driven from their country; but he also kept in his pay buffoons and musicians, and other merry persons, who were more caressed by the courtiers than the men famous for their deeds and learning. One of the guests was Sagacio Muzio Gazzata, the historian of Reggio, who has left us an account of the treatment which the illustrious and unfortunate exiles received. Various apartments were assigned to them in the palace, designated by various symbols; a Triumph for the warriors; Groves of the Muses for the poets; Mercury for the artists; Paradise for the preachers; and for all, inconstant Fortune. Can Grande likewise received at his court his illustrious prisoners of war, Giacomo di Carrara, Vanne Scornazano, Albertino Mussato, and many others. All had their private attendants, and a table equally well served. At times Can Grande invited some of them to his own table, particularly Dante, and Guido di Castel of Reggio, exiled from his country with the friends of liberty, and who for his simplicity was called the ‘Simple Lombard.’ ”</p>

						<p>“History, tradition, and the after fortunes of Dante, all agree in proving that there was a rupture between him and Cane; if it did not amount to a quarrel, there seems to have been some misunderstanding between the magnificent protector and his haughty client. But which of the two was in fault? I have collected all the memorials that remain relating to this, and let every one judge for himself. But I must warn my readers that Petrarch, the second of the three fathers of the Italian language, showed much less veneration than our good Boccaccio for their common predecessor Dante. Petrarch speaks as follows: ‘My fellow-citizen, Dante Alighieri, was a man highly distinguished in the vulgar tongue, but in his style and speech a little daring and rather freer than was pleasing to delicate and studious ears, or gratifying to the princes of our times. He then, while banished from his country, resided at the court of Can Grande, where the afflicted universally found consolation and an asylum. He at first was held in much honor by Cane, but afterwards he by degrees fell out of favor, and day by day less pleased that lord. Actors and parasites of every description used to be collected together at the same banquet; one of these, most impudent in his words and in his obscene gestures, obtained much importance and favor with many. And Cane, suspecting that Dante disliked this, called the man before him, and, having greatly praised him to our poet, said: “I wonder how it is that this silly fellow should know how to please all, and should be loved by all, and that thou canst not, who art said to be so wise!” Dante answered: “Thou wouldst not wonder if thou knewest that friendship is founded on similarity of habits and dispositions.” ’</p>
						<p>“It is also related, that at his table, which was too indiscriminately hospitable, where buffoons sat down with Dante, and where jests passed which must have been offensive to every person of refinement, but disgraceful when uttered by the superior in rank to his inferior, a boy was once concealed under the table, who, collecting the bones that were thrown there by the guests, according to the custom of those times, heaped them up at Dante’s feet. When the tables were removed, the great heap appearing, Cane pretended to show much astonishment, and said, ‘Certainly, Dante is a great devourer of meat.’ To which Dante readily replied, ‘My lord, you would not have seen so many bones had I been a dog (<i xml:lang="it">cane</i>).’ ”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Emperor was of a ruddy complexion, with brown hair; of a well made, handsome form, but a stern visage. His height was about eight of his own feet, which were very long. He was of a strong, robust make; his legs and thighs very stout, and his sinews firm. His face was thirteen inches long; his beard a palm; his nose half a palm; his forehead a foot over. His lion-like eyes flashed fire like carbuncles; his eyebrows were half a palm over. When he was angry, it was a terror to look upon him. He required eight spans for his girdle, besides what hung loose. He ate sparingly of bread; but a whole quarter of lamb, two fowls, a goose, or a large portion of pork; a peacock, a crane, or a whole hare. He drank moderately of wine and water. He was so strong, that he could at a single blow cleave asunder an armed soldier on horseback, from the head to the waist, and the horse likewise. He easily vaulted over four horses harnessed together, and could raise an armed man from the ground to his head, as he stood erect upon his hand.”</p>

					<p>Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lorraine, and leader of the First Crusade. He was born in 1061, and died, king of Jerusalem, in 1109. Gibbon thus sketches his character, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Decline and Fall</i>, <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LVIII</span>:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The first rank both in war and council is justly due to Godfrey of Bouillon; and happy would it have been for the Crusaders, if they had trusted themselves to the sole conduct of that accomplished hero, a worthy representative of Charlemagne, from whom he was descended in the female line. His father was of the noble race of the Counts of Boulogne; Brabant, the lower province of Lorraine, was the inheritance of his mother; and by the Emperor’s bounty he was himself invested with that ducal title which has been improperly transferred to his lordship of Bouillon in the Ardennes. In the service of Henry <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IV</span> he bore the great standard of the Empire, and pierced with his lance the breast of Rodolph, the rebel king; Godfrey was the first who ascended the walls of Rome; and his sickness, his vow, perhaps his remorse for bearing arms against the Pope, confirmed an early resolution of visiting the holy sepulchre, not as a pilgrim, but a deliverer. His valor was matured by prudence and moderation; his piety, though blind, was sincere; and, in the tumult of a camp, he practised the real and fictitious virtues of a convent. Superior to the private factions of the chiefs, he reserved his enmity for the enemies of Christ; and though he gained a kingdom by the attempt, his pure and disinterested zeal was acknowledged by his rivals. Godfrey of Bouillon was accompanied by his two brothers⁠—by Eustace, the elder, who had succeeded to the county of Boulogne, and by the younger, Baldwin, a character of more ambiguous virtue. The Duke of Lorraine was alike celebrated on either side of the Rhine; from his birth and education he was equally conversant with the French and Teutonic languages; the barons of France, Germany, and Lorraine assembled their vassals; and the confederate force that marched under his banner was composed of fourscore thousand foot and about ten thousand horse.”</p>

					<p>Robert Guiscard, founder of the kingdom of Naples, was the sixth of the twelve sons of the Baron Tancred de Hauteville of the diocese of Coutance in Lower Normandy, where he was born in the year 1015. In his youth he left his father’s castle as a military adventurer, and crossed the Alps to join the Norman army in Apulia, whither three of his brothers had gone before him, and whither at different times six others followed him. Here he gradually won his way by his sword; and having rendered some signal service to Pope Nicholas <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span>, he was made Duke of Apulia and Calabria, and of the lands in Italy and Sicily which he wrested from the Greeks and Saracens. Thus from a needy adventurer he rose to be the founder of a kingdom.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Italian conquests of Robert,” says Gibbon, “correspond with the limits of the present kingdom of Naples; and the countries united by his arms have not been dissevered by the revolutions of seven hundred years.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>The same historian, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Rise and Fall</i>, <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LVI</span>, gives the following character of Guiscard:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Robert was the eldest of the seven sons of the second marriage; and even the reluctant praise of his foes has endowed him with the heroic qualities of a soldier and a statesman. His lofty stature surpassed the tallest of his army; his limbs were cast in the true proportion of strength and gracefulness; and to the decline of life, he maintained the patient vigor of health and the commanding dignity of his form. His complexion was ruddy, his shoulders were broad, his hair and beard were long and of a flaxen color, his eyes sparkled with fire, and his voice, like that of Achilles, could impress obedience and terror amidst the tumult of battle. In the ruder ages of chivalry, such qualifications are not below the notice of the poet or historian; they may observe that Robert, at once, and with equal dexterity, could wield in the right hand his sword, his lance in the left; that in the battle of Civitella he was thrice unhorsed; and that in the close of that memorable day he was adjudged to have borne away the prize of valor from the warriors of the two armies. His boundless ambition was founded on the consciousness of superior worth; in the pursuit of greatness he was never arrested by the scruples of justice, and seldom moved by the feelings of humanity; though not insensible of fame, the choice of open or clandestine means was determined only by his present advantage. The surname of <em>Guiscard</em> was applied to this master of political wisdom, which is too often confounded with the practice of dissimulation and deceit; and Robert is praised by the Apulian poet for excelling the cunning of Ulysses and the eloquence of Cicero. Yet these arts were disguised by an appearance of military frankness; in his highest fortune he was accessible and courteous to his fellow-soldiers; and while he indulged the prejudices of his new subjects, he affected in his dress and manners to maintain the ancient fashion of his country. He grasped with a rapacious, that he might distribute with a liberal hand; his primitive indigence had taught the habits of frugality; the gain of a merchant was not below his attention; and his prisoners were tortured with slow and unfeeling cruelty to force a discovery of their secret treasure. According to the Greeks, he departed from Normandy with only five followers on horseback and thirty on foot; yet even this allowance appears too bountiful; the sixth son of Tancred of Hauteville passed the Alps as a pilgrim; and his first military band was levied among the adventurers of Italy. His brothers and countrymen had divided the fertile lands of Apulia; but they guarded their shares with the jealousy of avarice; the aspiring youth was driven forwards to the mountains of Calabria, and in his first exploits against the Greeks and the natives it is not easy to discriminate the hero from the robber. To surprise a castle or a convent, to ensnare a wealthy citizen, to plunder the adjacent villages for necessary food, were the obscure labors which formed and exercised the powers of his mind and body. The volunteers of Normandy adhered to his standard; and, under his command, the peasants of Calabria assumed the name and character of Normans.”</p>

					<p>The change from the red light of Mars to the white light of Jupiter. “This planet,” says Brunetto Latini, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Tresor</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CXI</span>, “is gentle and piteous, and full of all good things.” Of its symbolism Dante, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 14, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The heaven of Jupiter may be compared to Geometry on account of two properties. The first is, that it moves between two heavens repugnant to its good temperateness, as are that of Mars and that of Saturn; whence Ptolemy says, in the book cited, that Jupiter is a star of a temperate complexion, midway between the coldness of Saturn and the heat of Mars. The second is, that among all the stars it shows itself white, almost silvery. And these two things are in Geometry. Geometry moves between two opposites; as between the point and the circle (and I call in general everything round, whether a solid or a surface, a circle); for, as Euclid says, the point is the beginning of Geometry, and, as he says, the circle in its most perfect figure, and may therefore be considered its end; so that between the point and the circle, as between beginning and end, Geometry moves. And these two are opposed to its exactness; for the point, on account of its indivisibility, is immeasurable; and the circle, on account of its arc, it is impossible to square, and therefore it is impossible to measure it exactly. And moreover Geometry is very white, inasmuch as it is without spot of error, and very exact in itself and its handmaiden, which is called Perspective.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of the influences of Jupiter, Buti, quoting as usual Albumasar, speaks thus:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The planet Jupiter is of a cold, humid, airy, temperate nature, and signifies the natural soul, and life, and animate bodies, children and grandchildren, and beauty, and wise men and doctors of laws, and just judges, and firmness, and knowledge, and intellect, and interpretation of dreams, truth and divine worship, doctrine of law and faith, religion, veneration and fear of God, unity of faith and providence thereof, and regulation of manners and behavior, and will be laudable, and signifies patient observation, and perhaps also to it belong swiftness of mind, improvidence and boldness in dangers, and patience and delay, and it signifies beatitude, and acquisition, and victory,⁠ ⁠… and veneration, and kingdom, and kings, and rich men, nobles and magnates, hope and joy, and cupidity in commodities, also of fortune, in new kinds of grain, and harvests, and wealth, and security in all things, and good habits of mind, and liberality, command and goodness, boasting and bravery of mind, and boldness, true love and delight of supremacy over the citizens of a city, delight of potentates and magnates,⁠ ⁠… and beauty and ornament of dress, and joy and laughter, and affluence of speech, and glibness of tongue,⁠ ⁠… and hate of evil, and attachments among men, and command of the known, and avoidance of the unknown.

					<p>The Heaven of Saturn, where are seen the Spirits of the Contemplative.</p>
					<p>“This planet,” says Brunetto Latini, “is cruel, felonious, and of a cold nature.” Dante, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 14, makes it the symbol of Astrology:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Heaven of Saturn,” he says, “has two properties by which it may be compared to Astrology. The first is the slowness of its movement through the twelve signs; for, according to the writings of Astrologers, its revolution requires twenty-nine years and more. The second is, that it is the highest of all the planets. And these two properties are in Astrology; for in completing its circle, that is, in learning it, a great space of time passes; both on account of its demonstrations, which are more than in any of the above-mentioned sciences, and on account of the experience which is necessary to judge rightly in it. And, moreover, it is the highest of all; for, as Aristotle says at the beginning of his treatise on the Soul, Science is of high nobility, from the nobleness of its subject, and from its certainty; and this more than any of the above-mentioned is noble and high, from its noble and high subject, which is the movement of the heavens; and high and noble from its certainty, which is without any defect, as one that proceeds from a most perfect and regular source. And if any one thinks there is any defect in it, the defect is not on the side of the Science, but, as Ptolemy says, it comes from our negligence, and to that it should be attributed.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of the influences of Saturn, Buti, quoting Albumasar, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The nature of Saturn is cold, dry, melancholy, sombre, of grave asperity, and may be cold and moist, and of ugly color, and is of much eating and of true love,⁠ ⁠… And it signifies ships at sea, and journeyings long and perilous, and malice, and envy, and tricks, and seductions, and boldness in dangers,⁠ ⁠… and singularity, and little companionship of men, and pride and magnanimity, and simulation and boasting, and servitude of rulers, and every deed done with force and malice, and injuries, and anger, and strife, and bonds and imprisonment, truth in words, delight, and beauty, and intellect; experiments and diligence in cunning, and affluence of thought, and profoundness of counsel⁠ ⁠… And it signifies old and ponderous men, and gravity and fear, lamentation and sadness, embarrassment of mind, and fraud, and affliction, and destruction, and loss, and dead men, and remains of the dead; weeping and orphanhood, and ancient things, ancestors, uncles, elder brothers, servants and muleteers, and men despised, and robbers, and those who dig graves, and those who steal the garments of the dead, and tanners, vituperators, magicians, and warriors, and vile men.”</p>

					<p>Among the Apennines, east of Arezzo, rises Mount Catria, sometimes called, from its forked or double summit, the Forca di Fano. On its slope stands the monastery of Santa Croce di Fonte Avellama. Troya, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="it">Veltro Allegorico</i>, as quoted in Balbo’s <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Life and Times of Dante</i>, <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Bunbury’s <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 218, describes this region as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The monastery is built on the steepest mountains of Umbria. Catria, the giant of the Apennines, hangs over it, and so overshadows it that in some months of the year the light is frequently shut out. A difficult and lonely path through the forests leads to the ancient hospitium of these courteous hermits, who point out the apartments where their predecessors lodged Alighieri. We may read his name repeatedly on the walls; the marble effigy of him bears witness to the honorable care with which the memory of the great Italian is preserved from age to age in that silent retirement. The Prior Moricone received him there in 1318, and the annals of Avellana relate this event with pride. But if they had been silent, it would be quite sufficient to have seen Catria, and to have read Dante’s description of it, to be assured that he ascended it. There, from the woody summit of the rock, he gazed upon his country, and rejoiced in the thought that he was not far from her. He struggled with his desire to return to her; and when he <em>was</em> able to return, he banished himself anew, not to submit to dishonor. Having descended the mountain, he admired the ancient manners of the inhabitants of Avellana, but he showed little indulgence to his hosts, who appeared to him to have lost their old virtues. At this time, and during his residence near Gubbio, it seems that he must have written the five cantos of the Paradiso after the twentieth; because when he mentions Florence in the twenty-first canto he speaks of Catria, and in what he says in the twenty-fifth, of wishing to receive his poetic crown at his baptismal font, we can perceive his hope to be restored to his country and his beautiful fold (<i xml:lang="la">ovile</i>) when time should have overcome the difficulties of the manner of his return.”</p>

						<p>“They took particular pleasure in leading us to an echo, the wonder of Avellana, and the most powerful I ever heard. It repeats distinctly a whole line of verse, and even a line and a half.

						<p>“In order to find the recollection of Dante more present than in the cells, and even in the chamber of the inscription, I went out at night, and sat upon a stone a little above the monastery. The moon was not visible, being still hidden by the immense peaks; but I could see some of the less elevated summits struck by her first glimmerings. The chants of the monks came up to me through the darkness, and mingled with the bleating of a kid lost in the mountains. I saw through the window of the choir a white monk prostrate in prayer. I thought that perhaps Dante had sat upon that stone, that he had contemplated those rocks, that moon, and heard those chants always the same, like the sky and the mountains.”</p>

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Peter Damiano was born of a poor family at Ravenna, about 988; and, being left an orphan in his childhood, went to live with an elder brother, who set him to tending swine. Another brother, who was a priest at Ravenna, took compassion on him, and educated him. He in turn became a teacher; and, being of an ascetic turn of mind, he called himself Peter the Sinner, wore a hair shirt, and was assiduous in fasting and prayer. Two Benedictine monks of the monastery of Fonte Avellana, passing through Ravenna, stopped at the house where he lodged; and he resolved to join their brotherhood, which he did soon afterward. In 1041 he became Abbot of the monastery, and in 1057, Cardinal-Bishop of Ostia. In 1062 he returned to Fonte Avellana; and in 1072, being “fourscore and three years old,” died on his way to Rome, in the convent of Our Lady near Faenza.</p>
					<p>Of his life at Fonte Avellana, Butler, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Saints</i>, (<abbr>Feb.</abbr> 23,) <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 217, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Whatever austerities he prescribed to others he was the first to practise himself, remitting nothing of them even in his old age. He lived shut up in his cell as in a prison, fasted every day, except festivals, and allowed himself no other subsistence than coarse bread, bran, herbs, and water, and this he never drank fresh, but what he had kept from the day before. He tortured his body with iron girdles and frequent disciplines, to render it more obedient to the spirit. He passed the three first days of every Lent and Advent without taking any kind of nourishment whatsoever; and often for forty days together lived only on raw herbs and fruits, or on pulse steeped in cold water, without touching so much as bread, or anything which had passed the fire. A mat spread on the floor was his bed. He used to make wooden spoons and suchlike useful mean things, to exercise himself at certain hours in manual labor.”</p>

						<p>“There is scarcely a Pope or Emperor of importance who has not been personally connected with its history. From its mountain crag it has seen Goths, Lombards, Saracens, Normans, Frenchmen, Spaniards, Germans, scour and devastate the land which, through all modern history, has attracted every invader.</p>
						<p>“It is hard that, after it has escaped the storms of war and rapine, it should be destroyed by peaceful and enlightened legislation.</p>
						<p>“I do not, however, wish to plead its cause on sentimental grounds. The monastery contains a library which, in spite of the pilfering of the Popes, and the wanton burnings of Championnet, is still one of the richest in Italy; while its archives are, I believe, unequalled in the world. Letters of the Lombard kings who reigned at Pavia, of Hildebrand and the Countess Matilda, of Gregory and Charlemagne, are here no rarities. Since the days of Paulus Diaconus in the eighth century, it has contained a succession of monks devoted to literature. His mantle has descended in these later days to Abate Tosti, one of the most accomplished of contemporary Italian writers. In the Easter of last year, I found twenty monks in the monastery: they worked harder than anybody of Oxford or Cambridge fellows I am acquainted with; they educated two hundred boys, and fifty novices; they kept up all the services of their cathedral; the care of the archives included a laborious correspondence with literary men of all nations; they entertained hospitably any visitors who came to them; besides this, they had just completed a facsimile of their splendid manuscript of Dante, in a large folio volume, which was edited and printed by their own unassisted labor. This was intended as an offering to the kingdom of Italy in its new capital, and rumor says that they have incurred the displeasure of the Pope by their liberal opinions. On every ground of respect for prescription and civilization, it would be a gross injustice to destroy this monastery.</p>
						<p>“ ‘If we are saved,’ one of the monks said to me, ‘it will be by the public opinion of Europe.’ It is the most enlightened part of that opinion which I am anxious to rouse in their behalf.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In the palmy days of the monastery the Abbot of Monte Cassino was the First Baron of the realm, and is said to have held all the rights and privileges of other barons, and even criminal jurisdiction in the land. This the inhabitants of the town of Cassino found so intolerable, that they tried to buy the right with all the jewels of the women and all the silver of their households. When the law for the suppression of the convents passed, they are said to have celebrated the event with great enthusiasm; but the monks, as well they might, sang an <i xml:lang="la">Oremus</i> in their chapel, instead of a <span xml:lang="la">Te Deum</span>.</p>

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Benedict was born at Norcia, in the Duchy of Spoleto, in 480, and died at Monte Cassino in 543. In his early youth he was sent to school in Rome; but being shocked at the wild life of Roman school-boys, he fled from the city at the age of fourteen, and hid himself among the mountains of Subiaco, some forty miles away. A monk from a neighboring convent gave him a monastic dress, and pointed out to him a cave, in which he lived for three years, the monk supplying him with food, which he let down to him from above by a cord.</p>
					<p>In this retreat he was finally discovered by some shepherds, and the fame of his sanctity was spread through the land. The monks of Vicovara chose him for their Abbot, and then tried to poison him in his wine. He left them and returned to Subiaco; and there built twelve monasteries, placing twelve monks with a superior in each.</p>
					<p>Of the scenery of Subiaco, Lowell, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Fireside Travels</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 271, gives the following sketch:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Nothing can be more lovely than the scenery about Subiaco. The town itself is built on a kind of cone rising from the midst of a valley abounding in olives and vines, with a superb mountain horizon around it, and the green Anio cascading at its feet. As you walk to the high-perched convent of San Benedetto, you look across the river on your right just after leaving the town, to a cliff over which the ivy pours in torrents, and in which dwellings have been hollowed out. In the black doorway of every one sits a woman in scarlet bodice and white headgear, with a distaff, spinning, while overhead countless nightingales sing at once from the fringe of shrubbery. The glorious great white clouds look over the mountain-tops into our enchanted valley, and sometimes a lock of their vapory wool would be torn off, to lie for a while in some inaccessible ravine like a snowdrift; but it seemed as if no shadow could fly over our privacy of sunshine today. The approach to the monastery is delicious. You pass out of the hot sun into the green shadows of ancient ilexes, leaning and twisting every way that is graceful, their branches velvety with brilliant moss, in which grow feathery ferns, fringing them with a halo of verdure. Then comes the convent, with its pleasant old monks, who show their sacred vessels (one by Cellini) and their relics, among which is a finger-bone of one of the Innocents. Lower down is a convent of Santa Scolastica, where the first book was printed in Italy.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>In the gardens of the convent of San Benedetto still bloom, in their season, the roses, which the legend says have been propagated from the briers in which the saint rolled himself as a penance. But he had outward foes, as well as inward, to contend with, and they finally drove him from Subiaco to Monte Cassino.</p>
					<p>Montalembert, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Monks of the West</i>, Authorized <abbr>Tr.</abbr>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 16, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“However, Benedict had the ordinary fate of great men and saints. The great number of conversions worked by the example and fame of his austerity awakened a homicidal envy against him. A wicked priest of the neighborhood attempted first to decry and then to poison him. Being unsuccessful in both, he endeavored, at least, to injure him in the object of his most tender solicitude⁠—in the souls of his young disciples. For that purpose he sent, even into the garden of the monastery where Benedict dwelt and where the monks labored, seven wretched women, whose gestures, sports, and shameful nudity were designed to tempt the young monks to certain fall. Who does not recognize in this incident the mixture of barbarian rudeness and frightful corruption which characterize ages of decay and transition? When Benedict, from the threshold of his cell, perceived these shameless creatures, he despaired of his work; he acknowledged that the interest of his beloved children constrained him to disarm so cruel an enmity by retreat. He appointed superiors to the twelve monasteries which he had founded, and, taking with him a small number of disciples, he left forever the wild gorges of Subiaco, where he had lived for thirty-five years.</p>
						<p>“Without withdrawing from the mountainous region which extends along the western side of the Apennines, Benedict directed his steps towards the south, along the Abruzzi, and penetrated into that Land of Labor, the name of which seems naturally suited to a soil destined to be the cradle of the most laborious men whom the world has known. He ended his journey in a scene very different from that of Subiaco, but of incomparable grandeur and majesty. There, upon the boundaries of Samnium and Campania, in the centre of a large basin, half surrounded by abrupt and picturesque heights, rises a scarped and isolated hill, the vast and rounded summit of which overlooks the course of the Liris near its fountainhead, and the undulating plain which extends south towards the shores of the Mediterranean, and the narrow valleys which, towards the north, the east, and the west, lost themselves in the lines of the mountainous horizon. This is Monte Cassino. At the foot of this rock, Benedict found an amphitheatre of the time of the Caesars, amidst the ruins of the town of Casinum, which the most learned and pious of Romans, Varro, that pagan Benedictine, whose memory and knowledge the sons of Benedict took pleasure in honoring, had rendered illustrious. From the summit the prospect extended on one side towards Arpinum, where the prince of Roman orators was born, and on the other towards Aquinum, already celebrated as the birthplace of Juvenal, before it was known as the country of the Doctor Angelicus, which latter distinction should make the name of this little town known among all Christians.</p>
						<p>“It was amidst these noble recollections, this solemn nature, and upon that predestinated height, that the patriarch of the monks of the West founded the capital of the monastic order. He found paganism still surviving there. Two hundred years after Constantine, in the heart of Christendom, and so near Rome, there still existed a very ancient temple of Apollo and a sacred wood, where a multitude of peasants sacrificed to the gods and demons. Benedict preached the faith of Christ to these forgotten people; he persuaded them to cut down the wood, to overthrow the temple and the idol.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>On the ruins of this temple he built two chapels, and higher up the mountain, in 529, laid the foundation of his famous monastery. Fourteen years afterward he died in the church of this monastery, standing with his arms stretched out in prayer.</p>
					<p>“<abbr>St.</abbr> Bennet,” says Butler, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Saints</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">III</span> 235, “calls his Order a school in which men learn how to serve God; and his life was to his disciples a perfect model for their imitation, and a transcript of his rule. Being chosen by God, like another Moses, to conduct faithful souls into the true promised land, the kingdom of heaven, he was enriched with eminent supernatural gifts, even those of miracles and prophecy. He seemed like another Eliseus, endued by God with an extraordinary power, commanding all nature, and, like the ancient prophets, foreseeing future events. He often raised the sinking courage of his monks, and baffled the various artifices of the Devil with the sign of the cross, rendered the heaviest stone light in building his monastery by a short prayer, and, in presence of a multitude of people, raised to life a novice who had been crushed by the fall of a wall at Mount Cassino.”</p>
					<p>A story of <abbr>St.</abbr> Benedict and his sister Scholastica is thus told by <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Jameson, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Legends of Monastic Orders</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 12:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Towards the close of his long life Benedict was consoled for many troubles by the arrival of his sister Scholastica, who had already devoted herself to a religious life, and now took up her residence in a retired cell about a league and a half from his convent. Very little is known of Scholastica, except that she emulated her brother’s piety and self-denial; and although it is not said that she took any vows, she is generally considered as the first Benedictine nun. When she followed her brother to Monte Cassino, she drew around her there a small community of pious women; but nothing more is recorded of her, except that he used to visit her once a year. On one occasion, when they had been conversing together on spiritual matters till rather late in the evening, Benedict rose to depart; his sister entreated him to remain a little longer, but he refused. Scholastica then, bending her head over her clasped hands, prayed that Heaven would interfere and render it impossible for her brother to leave her. Immediately there came on such a furious tempest of rain, thunder, and lightning, that Benedict was obliged to delay his departure for some hours. As soon as the storm had subsided, he took leave of his sister, and returned to the monastery: it was a last meeting; <abbr>St.</abbr> Scholastica died two days afterwards, and <abbr>St.</abbr> Benedict, as he was praying in his cell, beheld the soul of his sister ascending to heaven in the form of a dove. This incident is often found in the pictures painted for the Benedictine nuns.”</p>

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Macarius, who established the monastic rule of the East, as <abbr>St.</abbr> Benedict did that of the West, was a confectioner of Alexandria, who, carried away by religious enthusiasm, became an anchorite in the Thebaid of Upper Egypt, about 335. In 373 he came to Lower Egypt, and lived in the Desert of the Cells, so called from the great multitude of its hermit-cells. He had also hermitages in the deserts of Scetè and Nitria; and in these several places he passed upwards of sixty years in holy contemplation, saying to his soul, “Having taken up thine abode in heaven, where thou hast God and his holy angels to converse with, see that thou descend not thence; regard not earthly things.”</p>
					<p>Among other anecdotes of <abbr>St.</abbr> Macarius, Butler, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Saints</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 50, relates the following:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Our saint happened one day inadvertently to kill a gnat that was biting him in his cell; reflecting that he had lost the opportunity of suffering that mortification, he hastened from his cell for the marshes of Scetè, which abound with great flies, whose stings pierce even wild boars. There he continued six months exposed to those ravaging insects; and to such a degree was his whole body disfigured by them with sores and swellings, that when he returned he was only to be known by his voice.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Romualdus, founder of the Order of Camaldoli, or Reformed Benedictines, was born of the noble family of the Onesti, in Ravenna, about 956. Brought up in luxury and ease, he still had glimpses of better things, and, while hunting the wild boar in the pine woods of Ravenna, would sometimes stop to muse, and, uttering a prayer, exclaim: “How happy were the ancient hermits who had such habitations.”</p>
					<p>At the age of twenty he saw his father kill his adversary in a duel; and, smitten with remorse, imagined that he must expiate the crime by doing penance in his own person. He accordingly retired to a Benedictine convent in the neighborhood of Ravenna, and became a monk. At the end of seven years, scandalized with the irregular lives of the brotherhood, and their disregard of the rules of the Order, he undertook the difficult task of bringing them back to the austere life of their founder. After a conflict of many years, during which he encountered and overcame the usual perils that beset the path of a reformer, he succeeded in winning over some hundreds of his brethren, and established his new Order of Reformed Benedictines.</p>
					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Romualdus built many monasteries; but chief among them is that of Camaldoli, thirty miles east of Florence, which was founded in 1009. It takes its name from the former owner of the land, a certain Maldoli, who gave it to <abbr>St.</abbr> Romualdus. Campo Maldoli, say the authorities, became Camaldoli. It is more likely to be the Tuscan Ca’ Maldoli, for Casa Maldoli.</p>
					<p>“In this place,” says Butler, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Saints</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 86, “<abbr>St.</abbr> Romuald built a monastery, and, by the several observances he added to <abbr>St.</abbr> Benedict’s rule, gave birth to that new Order called Camaldoli, in which he united the cenobitic and eremitical life. After seeing in a vision his monks mounting up a ladder to heaven all in white, he changed their habit from black to white. The hermitage is two short miles distant from the monastery. It is a mountain quite overshaded by a dark wood of fir-trees. In it are seven clear springs of water. The very sight of this solitude in the midst of the forest helps to fill the mind with compunction, and a love of heavenly contemplation. On entering it, we meet with a chapel of <abbr>St.</abbr> Antony for travellers to pray in before they advance any farther. Next are the cells and lodgings for the porters. Somewhat farther is the church, which is large, well built, and richly adorned. Over the door is a clock, which strikes so loud that it may be heard all over the desert. On the left side of the church is the cell in which <abbr>St.</abbr> Romuald lived, when he first established these hermits. Their cells, built of stone, have each a little garden walled round. A constant fire is allowed to be kept in every cell on account of the coldness of the air throughout the year; each cell has also a chapel in which they may say mass.”</p>
					<p>See also <a href="#note-595">note 595</a>. The legend of <abbr>St.</abbr> Romualdus says that he lived to the age of one hundred and twenty. It says, also, that in 1466, nearly four hundred years after his death, his body was found still uncorrupted; but that four years later, when it was stolen from its tomb, it crumbled into dust. <a href="paradiso.xhtml#noteref-1794" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>So neglected, that it is mere waste of paper to transcribe it. In commenting upon this line, Benvenuto gives an interesting description of Boccaccio’s visit to the library of Monte Casino, which he had from his own lips.</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“To the clearer understanding of this passage,” he says, “I will repeat what my venerable preceptor Boccaccio of Certaldo pleasantly narrated to me. He said, that when he was in Apulia, being attracted by the fame of the place, he went to the noble monastery of Monte Cassino, of which we are speaking. And being eager to see the library, which he had heard was very noble, he humbly⁠—gentle creature that he was!⁠—besought a monk to do him the favor to open it. Pointing to a lofty staircase, he answered stiffly, ‘Go up; it is open.’ Joyfully ascending, he found the place of so great a treasure without door or fastening; and having entered, he saw the grass growing upon the windows, and all the books and shelves covered with dust. And, wondering, he began to open and turn over, now this book and now that, and found there many and various volumes of ancient and rare works. From some of them whole sheets had been torn out, in others the margins of the leaves were clipped, and thus they were greatly defaced. At length, full of pity that the labors and studies of so many illustrious minds should have fallen into the hands of such profligate men, grieving and weeping he withdrew. And coming into the cloister, he asked a monk whom he met, why those most precious books were so vilely mutilated. He replied, that some of the monks, wishing to gain a few ducats, cut out a handful of leaves, and made psalters which they sold to boys; and likewise of the margins they made breviaries which they sold to women. Now therefore, O scholar, rack thy brains in the making of books!”</p>

					<p>The Heaven of the Fixed Stars. Of the symbolism of this heaven, Dante, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.play">Convito</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 15, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Starry Heaven may be compared to Physics on account of three properties, and to Metaphysics on account of three others; for it shows us two visible things, such as its many stars, and the Galaxy; that is, the white circle which the vulgar call the Road of <abbr>St.</abbr> James; and it shows us one of its poles, and the other it conceals from us; and it shows us only one motion from east to west, and another which it has from west to east, it keeps almost hidden from us. Therefore we must note in order, first its comparison with Physics, and then with Metaphysics. The Starry Heaven, I say, shows us many stars; for, according as the wise men of Egypt have computed, down to the last star that appears in their meridian, there are one thousand and twenty-two clusters of the stars I speak of. And in this it bears a great resemblance to Physics, if these three members, namely, two and twenty and a thousand, are carefully considered; for by the two is understood the local movement, which of necessity is from one point to another; and by the twenty is signified the movement of modification; for, inasmuch as from the ten upwards we proceed only by modifying this ten with the other nine, and with itself, and the most beautiful modification which it receives is that with itself, and the first which it receives is twenty, consequently the movement aforesaid is signified by this number. And by the thousand is signified the movement of increase; for in name this thousand is the greatest number, and cannot increase except by multiplying itself. And Physics show these three movements only, as is proved in the fifth chapter of its first book. And on account of the Galaxy this heaven has great resemblance to Metaphysics. For it must be known that of this Galaxy the philosophers have held diverse opinions. For the Pythagoreans said that the Sun once wandered out of his path; and, passing through other parts not adapted to his heat, he burned the place through which he passed, and the appearance of the burning remained there. I think they were influenced by the fable of Phaeton which Ovid narrates at the beginning of the second book of his Metamorphoses. Others, as Anaxagoras and Democritus, said that it was the light of the Sun reflected in that part. And these opinions they proved by demonstrative reasons. What Aristotle said upon this subject cannot be exactly known, because his opinion is not the same in one translation as in the other. And I think this was an error of the translators; for in the new he seems to say that it is a collection of vapors beneath the stars in that part, which always attract them; and this does not seem to be very reasonable. In the old he says, that the Galaxy is nothing but a multitude of fixed stars in that part, so small that we cannot distinguish them here below, but from them proceeds that brightness which we call the Galaxy. And it may be that the heaven in that part is more dense, and there fore retains and reflects that light; and this seems to be the opinion of Aristotle, Avicenna, and Ptolemy. Hence, inasmuch as the Galaxy is an effect of those stars which we cannot see, but comprehend by their effects, and Metaphysics treats of first substances, which likewise we cannot comprehend except by their effects, it is manifest that the starry heaven has great resemblance to Metaphysics. Still further, by the pole which we see it signifies things obvious to sense, of which, taking them as a whole, Physics treats; and by the pole which we do not see it signifies the things which are immaterial, which are not obvious to sense, of which Metaphysics treats; and therefore the aforesaid heaven bears a great resemblance to both these sciences. Still further, by its two movements it signifies these two sciences; for, by the movement in which it revolves daily and makes a new circuit from point to point, it signifies the corruptible things in nature, which daily complete their course, and their matter is changed from form to form; and of this Physics treats; and by the almost insensible movement which it makes from west to east of one degree in a hundred years, it signifies the things incorruptible, which had from God the beginning of existence, and shall never have an end; and of these Metaphysics treats.”</p>

						<p>“Which as I was gazing at in amazement, I said, as I recovered myself, from whence proceed these sounds so strong, and yet so sweet, that fill my ears? ‘The melody,’ replies he, ‘which you hear, and which, though composed in unequal time, is nevertheless divided into regular harmony, is effected by the impulse and motion of the spheres themselves, which, by a happy temper of sharp and grave notes, regularly produces various harmonic effects. Now it is impossible that such prodigious movements should pass in silence; and nature teaches that the sounds which the spheres at one extremity utter must be sharp, and those on the other extremity must be grave; on which account that highest revolution of the star-studded heaven, whose motion is more rapid, is carried on with a sharp and quick sound; whereas this of the moon, which is situated the lowest, and at the other extremity, moves with the gravest sound. For the earth, the ninth sphere, remaining motionless, abides invariably in the innermost position, occupying the central spot in the universe.</p>
						<p>“ ‘Now these eight directions, two of which have the same powers, effect seven sounds, differing in their modulations, which number is the connecting principle of almost all things. Some learned men, by imitating this harmony with strings and vocal melodies, have opened a way for their return to this place; as all others have done, who, endued with preeminent qualities, have cultivated in their mortal life the pursuits of heaven.</p>
						<p>“ ‘The ears of mankind, filled with these sounds, have become deaf, for of all your senses it is the most blunted. Thus the people who live near the place where the Nile rushes down from very high mountains to the parts which are called Catadupa, are destitute of the sense of hearing, by reason of the greatness of the noise. Now this sound, which is effected by the rapid rotation of the whole system of nature, is so powerful, that human hearing cannot comprehend it, just as you cannot look directly upon the sun, because your sight and sense are overcome by his beams.’ ”</p>

If from this fourth you deduct the space occupied by the seas and lakes, and the vast sandy regions which extreme heat and want of water render uninhabitable, there remains but a very small proportion of the terrestrial sphere for the habitation of men.

						<p>“The triumph of Christ is, of all subjects, that which has excited the most enthusiasm amongst artists; it is seen in numerous monuments, and is represented both in painting and sculpture, but always with such remarkable modifications as impart to it the character of a new work. The eastern portion of the crypt of the cathedral of Auxerre contains, in the vaulting of that part which corresponds with the sanctuary, a fresco painting, executed about the end of the twelfth century, and representing, in the most simple form imaginable, the triumph of Christ. The background of the picture is intersected by a cross, which, if the transverse branches were a little longer, would be a perfect Greek cross. This cross is adorned with imitations of precious stones, round, oval, and lozenge-shaped, disposed in quincunxes. In the centre is a figure of Christ, on a white horse with a saddle; he holds the bridle in his left hand, and in the right, the hand of power and authority, a black staff, the rod of iron by which he governs the nations. He advances thus, having his head adorned with an azure or bluish nimbus, intersected by a cross gules; his face is turned towards the spectator. In the four compartments formed by the square in which the cross is enclosed are four angels who form the escort of Jesus; they are all on horseback, like their master, and with wings outspread; the right hand of each, which is free, is open and raised, in token of adoring admiration. ‘And I saw heaven opened, and be hold a white horse; and he that sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he doth judge and make war. His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many crowns; and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself. And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood; and his name is called the Word of God. And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen white and clean.’ Such is the language of the Apocalypse, and this the fresco at Auxerre interprets, although with some slight alterations, which it will be well to observe.”</p>

In reading John it is always with me as though I saw him before me, lying on the bosom of his Master at the last supper: as though his angel were holding the light for me, and in certain passages would fall upon my neck and whisper something in mine ear. I am far from understanding all I read, but it often seems to me as if what John meant were floating before in the distance; and even when I look into a passage altogether dark, I have a foretaste of some great, glorious meaning, which I shall one day understand, and for this reason I grasp so eagerly after every new interpretation of the Gospel of John. Indeed, most of them only play upon the edge of the evening cloud, and the moon behind it has quiet rest.”</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Crystalline Heaven, which has previously been called the Primum Mobile, has a very manifest resemblance to Moral Philosophy; for Moral Philosophy, as Thomas says in treating of the second book of the Ethics, directs us to the other sciences. For, as the Philosopher says in the fifth of the Ethics, legal justice directs us to learn the sciences, and orders them to be learned and mastered, so that they may not be abandoned; so this heaven directs with its movement the daily revolutions of all the others, by which daily they all receive here below the virtue of all their parts. For if its revolution did not thus direct, little of their virtues would reach here below, and little of their sight. Hence, supposing it were possible for this ninth heaven to stand still, the third part of heaven would not be seen in each part of the earth; and Saturn would be hidden from each part of the earth fourteen years and a half; and Jupiter, six years; and Mars, almost a year; and the Sun, one hundred and eighty-two days and fourteen hours (I say days, that is, so much time as so many days would measure); and Venus and Mercury would conceal and show themselves nearly as the Sun; and the Moon would be hidden from all people for the space of fourteen days and a half. Truly there would be here below no production, nor life of animals, nor plants; there would be neither night, nor day, nor week, nor month, nor year; but the whole universe would be deranged, and the movement of the stars in vain. And not otherwise, were Moral Philosophy to cease, the other sciences would be for a time concealed, and there would be no production, nor life of felicity, and in vain would be the writings or discoveries of antiquity. Wherefore it is very manifest that this heaven bears a resemblance to Moral Philosophy.”</p>

					<p>This neglected centesimal was the omission of some inconsiderable fraction or centesimal part, in the computation of the year according to the Julian calendar, which was corrected in the Gregorian, some two centuries and a half after Dante’s death. By this error, in a long lapse of time, the months would cease to correspond to the seasons, and January be no longer a winter, but a spring month.</p>
					<p>Sir John Herschel, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Treatise on Astronomy</i>, <abbr>Ch.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span>, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The Julian rule made every fourth year, without exception, a bissextile. This is, in fact, an over-correction; it supposes the length of the tropical year to be 365¼ <abbr>d.</abbr>, which is too great, and thereby induces an error of 7 days in 900 years, as will easily appear on trial. Accordingly, so early as the year 1414, it began to be perceived that the equinoxes were gradually creeping away from the 21st of March and September, where they ought to have always fallen had the Julian year been exact, and happening (as it appeared) too early. The necessity of a fresh and effectual reform in the calendar was from that time continually urged, and at length admitted. The change (which took place under the Popedom of Gregory <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XIII</span>) consisted in the omission of ten nominal days after the 4th of October, 1582 (so that the next day was called the 15th, and not the 5th), and the promulgation of the rule already explained for future regulation.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>It will appear from the verse of Dante, that this error and its consequences had been noticed a century earlier than the year mentioned by Herschel.

						<p>“Within a circle of ineffable joy, circumscribed only by light and love, a point of intense brightness so dazzled the eyes of Dante that he could not sustain the sight of it. Around this vivid centre, from which the heavens and all nature depend, nine concentric circles of the Celestial Hierarchy revolved with a velocity inversely proportioned to their distance from it, the nearer circles moving more rapidly, the remoter ones less. The poet at first is surprised at this, it being the reverse of the relative movement, from the same source of propulsion, of the heavens themselves around the earth as their centre. But the infallible Beatrice assures him that this difference arises, in fact, from the same cause, proximity to the Divine presence, which in the celestial spheres is greater the farther they are from the centre, but in the circles of angels, on the contrary, it is greater the nearer they are to it.”</p>

					<p>Thomas Aquinas, the <em>Doctor Angelicas</em> of the Schools, treats the subject of Angels at great length in the first volume of his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Summa Theologica</i>, from <abbr>Quaest.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">L</span> to <span epub:type="z3998:roman">LXIV</span>, and from <abbr>Quaest.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CVI</span> to <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CXIV</span>. He constantly quotes Dionysius, sometimes giving his exact words, but oftener amplifying and interpreting his meaning. In <abbr>Quaest.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">CVIII</span> he discusses the names of the Angels, and of the Seraphim and Cherubim speaks as follows:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The name of Seraphim is not given from love alone, but from excess of love, which the name of heat or burning implies. Hence Dionysius (<abbr>Cap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> <em><abbr>Coel.</abbr> <abbr>Hier.</abbr></em>, a <abbr>princ.</abbr>) interprets the name Seraphim according to the properties of fire, in which is excess of heat. In fire, however, we may consider three things. First, a certain motion which is upward, and which is continuous; by which is signified, that they are unchangingly moving towards God. Secondly, its active power, which is heat;⁠ ⁠… and by this is signified the influence of this kind of Angels, which they exercise powerfully on those beneath them, exciting them to a sublime fervor, and thoroughly purifying them by burning. Thirdly, in fire its brightness must be considered; and this signifies that such Angels have within themselves an inextinguishable light, and that they perfectly illuminate others.</p>
						<p>“In the same way the name of Cherubim is given from a certain excess of knowledge; hence it is interpreted <i xml:lang="la">plenitudo scientiae</i>; which Dionysius (<abbr>Cap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VII</span> <em><abbr>Coel.</abbr> <abbr>Hier.</abbr></em>, a <abbr>princ.</abbr>) explains in four ways: first, as perfect vision of God; secondly, full reception of divine light; thirdly, that in God himself they contemplate the beauty of the order of things emanating from God; fourthly, that, being themselves full of this kind of knowledge, they copiously pour it out upon others.”</p>

First, in reference to position, because chairs are raised above the ground; and thus these Angels, which are called Thrones, are raised so far that they can perceive immediately in God the reasons of things. Secondly, in material chairs firmness must be considered, because one sits firmly in them; but this is <i xml:lang="la">e converso</i>, for the Angels themselves are made firm by God. Thirdly, because the chair receives the sitter, and he can be carried in it; and thus the Angels receive God in themselves, and in a certain sense carry him to their inferiors. Fourthly, from their shape, because the chair is open on one side, to receive the sitter; and thus these Angels, by their promptitude, are open to receive God and to serve him.”</p>

					<p class="continued">To Dionysius was attributed a work, called <em>The Celestial Hierarchy</em>, which is the great storehouse of all that relates to the nature and operations of Angels.

It says he was called the Areopagite from the quarter where he lived; that he was surnamed Theosoph, or the Wise in God; that he was converted, not by the preaching of <abbr>St.</abbr> Paul, but by a miracle the saint wrought in restoring a blind man to sight; and that “the woman named Damaris,” who was converted with him, was his wife. It quotes from a letter of his to Polycarp, written from Egypt, where he was with his friend and fellow-student Apollophanes, and where he witnessed the darkening of the sun at the Crucifixion:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“We were both at Heliopolis, when suddenly we saw the moon conceal the surface of the sun, though this was not the time for an eclipse, and this darkness continued for three hours, and the light returned at the ninth hour and lasted till evening.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p class="continued">And finally it narrates, that when Dionysius was beheaded, in Paris, where he had converted many souls and built many churches, “straightway the body arose, and, taking its head in its arms, led by an angel, and surrounded by a celestial light, carried it a distance of two miles, from a place called the Mount of Martyrs, to the place where it now reposes.”</p>

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Jerome, the greatest of the Latin Fathers of the Church, and author of the translation of the Scriptures known, as the <span epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Vulgate</span>, was born of wealthy parents in Dalmatia, in 342. He studied at Rome under the grammarian Donatus, and became a lawyer in that city. At the age of thirty he visited the Holy Land, and, withdrawing from the world, became an anchorite in the desert of Chalcida, on the borders of Arabia. Here he underwent the bodily privations and temptations, and enjoyed the spiritual triumphs, of the hermit’s life. He was “haunted by demons, and consoled by voices and visions from heaven.” In one of his letters, cited by Butler, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Lives of the Saints</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">IX</span> 362, he writes:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“In the remotest part of a wild and sharp desert, which, being burnt up with the heats of the scorching sun, strikes with horror and terror even the monks that inhabit it, I seemed to myself to be in the midst of the delights and assemblies of Rome. I loved solitude, that in the bitterness of my soul I might more freely bewail my miseries, and call upon my Saviour. My hideous emaciated limbs were covered with sackcloth: my skin was parched dry and black, and my flesh was almost wasted away. The days I passed in tears and groans, and when sleep overpowered me against my will, I cast my wearied bones, which hardly hung together, upon the bare ground, not so properly to give them rest, as to torture myself. I say nothing of my eating and drinking; for the monks in that desert, when they are sick, know no other drink but cold water, and look upon it as sensuality ever to eat anything dressed by fire. In this exile and prison, to which, for the fear of hell, I had voluntarily condemned myself, having no other company but scorpions and wild beasts, I many times found my imagination filled with lively representations of dances in the company of Roman ladies, as if I had been in the midst of them.⁠ ⁠… I often joined whole nights to the days, crying, sighing, and beating my breast till the desired calm returned. I feared the very cell in which I lived, because it was witness to the foul suggestions of my enemy; and being angry and armed with severity against myself, I went alone into the most secret parts of the wilderness, and if I discovered anywhere a deep valley, or a craggy rock, that was the place of my prayer, there I threw this miserable sack of my body. The same Lord is my witness, that after so many sobs and tears, after having in much sorrow looked long up to heaven, I felt most delightful comforts and interior sweetness; and these so great, that, transported and absorpt, I seemed to myself to be amidst the choirs of angels; and glad and joyful I sung to God: <q>After Thee, O Lord, we will run in the fragrancy of thy celestial ointments</q>.”</p>
					</blockquote>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“O desert, enamelled with the flowers of Christ! O solitude, where those stones are born of which, in the Apocalypse, is built the city of the Great King! O retreat, which rejoicest in the friendship of God! What doest thou in the world, my brother, with thy soul greater than the world? How long wilt thou remain in the shadow of roofs, and in the smoky dungeons of cities? Believe me, I see here more of the light.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>At the end of five years he was driven from his solitude by the persecution of the Eastern monks; and lived successively in Jerusalem, Antioch, Constantinople, Rome, and Alexandria. Finally, in 385, he returned to the Holy Land, and built a monastery at Bethlehem. Here he wrote his translation of the Scriptures, and his Lives of the Fathers of the Desert; but in 416 this monastery, and others that had risen up in its neighborhood, were burned by the Pelagians, and <abbr>St.</abbr> Jerome took refuge in a strong tower or fortified castle.

					<blockquote>
						<p>“What do your praises advantage me, when I see not your progress in virtue? Or what harm shall I receive from the silence of my auditors, when I behold the increase of their piety? The praise of the speaker is not the acclamation of his hearers, but their zeal for piety and religion; not their making a great stir in the times of hearing, but their showing diligence at all other times. Applause, as soon as it is out of the mouth, is dispersed into the air, and vanishes; but when the hearers grow better, this brings an incorruptible and immortal reward both to the speaker and the hearer. The praise of your acclamation may render the orator more illustrious here, but the piety of your souls will give him greater confidence before the tribunal of Christ. Therefore, if any one love the preacher, or if any preacher love his people, let him not be enamored with applause, but with the benefit of the hearers.”</p>

						<p>“I have read somewhere that the hog is given to <abbr>St.</abbr> Anthony, because he had been a swineherd, and cured the diseases of swine. This is quite a mistake. The hog was the representative of the demon of sensuality and gluttony, which Anthony is supposed to have vanquished by the exercises of piety and by divine aid. The ancient custom of placing in all his effigies a black pig at his feet, or under his feet, gave rise to the super stition that this unclean animal was especially dedicated to him, and under his protection. The monks of the Order of <abbr>St.</abbr> Anthony kept herds of consecrated pigs, which were allowed to feed at the public charge, and which it was a profanation to steal or kill: hence the proverb about the fatness of a ‘Tantony pig.’ ”</p>

Some derive this saying from a privilege enjoyed by the friars of certain convents in England and France, sons of <abbr>St.</abbr> Anthony, whose swine were permitted to feed in the streets. These swine would follow any one having greens or other provisions, till they obtained some of them; and it was in those days considered an act of charity and religion to feed them. <abbr>St.</abbr> Anthony was invoked for the pig.”</p>

					<p>Among the Simoniacs in the third round of Malebolge. Of Simon Magus, Milman, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">History of Latin Christianity</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">II</span> 97, writes thus:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Unless Simon was in fact a personage of considerable importance during the early history of Christianity, it is difficult to account for his becoming, as he is called by Beausobre, the hero of the Romance of Heresy. If Simon was the same with that magician, a Cypriot by birth, who was employed by Felix as agent in his intrigue to detach Drusilla from her husband, this part of his character accords with the charge of licentiousness advanced both against his life and his doctrines by his Christian opponents. This is by no means improbable; and indeed, even if he was not a person thus politically prominent and influential, the early writers of Christianity would scarcely have concurred in representing him as a formidable and dangerous antagonist of the Faith as a kind of personal rival of <abbr>St.</abbr> Peter, without some other groundwork for the fiction besides the collision recorded in the Acts. The doctrines which are ascribed to him and to his followers, who continued to exist for several centuries, harmonize with the glimpse of his character and tenets in the writings of <abbr>St.</abbr> Luke. Simon probably was one of that class of adventurers which abounded at this period, or like Apollonius of Tyana, and others at a later time, with whom the opponents of Christianity attempted to confound Jesus and his Apostles. His doctrine was Oriental in its language and in its pretensions. He was the first Aeon or emanation, or rather perhaps the first manifestation of the primal Deity. He assumed not merely the title of the Great Power or Virtue of God, but all the other Appellations⁠—the Word, the Perfection, the Paraclete, the Almighty, the whole combined attributes of the Deity. He had a companion, Helena, according to the statement of his enemies, a beautiful prostitute, whom he found at Tyre, who became in like manner the first conception (the Ennoea) of the Deity; but who, by her conjunction with matter, had been enslaved to its malignant influence, and, having fallen under the power of evil angels, had been in a constant state of transmigration, and, among other mortal bodies, had occupied that of the famous Helen of Troy. Beausobre, who elevates Simon into a Platonic philosopher, explains the Helena as a sublime allegory. She was the Psyche of his philosophic romance. The soul, by evil influences, had become imprisoned in matter. By her the Deity had created the angels: the angels, enamored of her, had inextricably entangled her in that polluting bondage, in order to prevent her return to heaven. To fly from their embraces she had passed from body to body. Connecting this fiction with the Grecian mythology, she was Minerva, or impersonated Wisdom; perhaps, also, Helena, or embodied Beauty.”</p>

						<p>“The great church of <abbr>St.</abbr> John Lateran, ‘the mother and head of all the churches of the city and the world,’⁠—<i xml:lang="la">mater urbis et orbis</i>⁠—had been almost destroyed by fire, with its adjoining palace, and the houses of the canons, on the Eve of <abbr>St.</abbr> John, in 1308. The palace and the canons houses were rebuilt not long after; but at the time of Petrarch’s latest visit to Rome, and for years afterward, the church was without a roof, and its walls were ruinous. The poet addressed three at least of the Popes at Avignon with urgent appeals that this disgrace should no longer be permitted⁠—but the Popes gave no heed to his words; for the ruin of Roman churches, or of Rome itself, was a matter of little concern to these Transalpine prelates.”</p>

					<p><abbr>St.</abbr> Bernard, the great Abbot of Clairvaux, the “Doctor Mellifluus” of the Church, and preacher of the disastrous Second Crusade, was born of noble parents in the village of Fontaine, near Dijon, in Burgundy, in the year 1190. After studying at Paris, at the age of twenty he entered the Benedictine monastery of Citeaux; and when, five years later, this monastery had become overcrowded with monks, he was sent out to found a new one.</p>
					<p><abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mrs.</abbr> Jameson, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Legends of the Monastic Orders</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 149, says:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“The manner of going forth on these occasions was strikingly characteristic of the age;⁠—the abbot chose twelve monks, representing the twelve Apostles, and placed at their head a leader, representing Jesus Christ, who, with a cross in his hand, went before them. The gates of the convent opened⁠—then closed behind them⁠—and they wandered into the wide world, trusting in God to show them their destined abode.</p>
						<p>“Bernard led his followers to a wilderness, called the <em>Valley of Wormwood</em>, and there, at his biding, arose the since renowned abbey of Clairvaux. They felled the trees, built themselves huts, tilled and sowed the ground, and changed the whole face of the country round; till that which had been a dismal solitude, the resort of wolves and robbers, became a land of vines and corn, rich, populous, and prosperous.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>This incident forms the subject of one of Murillo’s most famous paintings, and is suggestive of the saint’s intense devotion to the Virgin, which Dante expresses in this line.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>“With Bernard the monastic life is the one thing needful. He began life by drawing after him into the convent all his kindred; sweeping them one by one from the high seas of the world with the irresistible vortex of his own religious fervor. His incessant cry for Europe is, Better monasteries, and more of them. Let these ecclesiastical castles multiply; let them cover and command the land, well garrisoned with men of God, and then, despite all heresy and schism, theocracy will flourish, the earth shall yield her increase, and all people praise the Lord. Who so wise as Bernard to win souls for Christ, that is to say, recruits for the cloister? With what eloquence he paints the raptures of contemplation, the vanity and sin of earthly ambition or of earthly love! Wherever in his travels Bernard may have preached, there, presently, exultant monks must open wide their doors to admit new converts. Wherever he goes, he bereaves mothers of their children, the aged of their last solace and last support; praising those the most who leave most misery behind them. How sternly does he rebuke those Rachels who mourn and will not be comforted for children dead to them forever! What vitriol does he pour into the wounds when he asks if they will drag their son down to perdition with themselves by resisting the vocation of Heaven; whether it was not enough that they brought him forth sinful to a world of sin, and will they now, in their insane affection, cast him into the fires of hell? Yet Bernard is not hard-hearted by nature. He can pity this disgraceful weakness of the flesh. He makes such amends as superstition may. I will be a father to him, he says. Alas! cold comfort. You, their hearts will answer, whose flocks are countless, would nothing content you but our ewe lamb? Perhaps some cloister will be, for them too, the last resource of their desolation. They will fly for ease in their pain to the system which caused it. Bernard hopes so. So inhuman is the humanity of asceticism; cruel its tender mercies; thus does it depopulate the world of its best in order to improve it.⁠ ⁠…</p>
						<p>“Bernard had his wish. He made Clairvaux the cynosure of all contemplative eyes. For any one who could exist at all as a monk, with any satisfaction to himself, that was the place above all others. Brother Godfrey, sent out to be first Abbot of Fontenay⁠—as soon as he has set all things in order there, returns, only too gladly, from that rich and lovely region, to reenter his old cell, to walk around, delightedly revisiting the well-remembered spots among the trees or by the waterside, marking how the fields and gardens have come on, and relating to the eager brethren (for even Bernard’s monks have curiosity) all that befell him in his work. He would sooner be third Prior at Clairvaux, than Abbot of Fontenay. So, too, with Brother Humbert, commissioned in like manner to regulate Igny Abbey (fourth daughter of Clairvaux). He soon comes back, weary of the labor and sick for home, to look on the Aube once more, to hear the old mills go drumming and droning, with that monotony of muffled sound⁠—the associate of his pious reveries⁠—often heard in his dreams when far away; to set his feet on the very same flagstone in the choir where he used to stand, and to be happy. But Bernard, though away in Italy, toiling in the matter of the schism, gets to hear of his return, and finds time to send him across the Alps a letter of rebuke for this criminal self-pleasing, whose terrible sharpness must have darkened the poor man’s meditations for many a day.</p>
						<p>“Bernard had further the satisfaction of improving and extending monasticism to the utmost; of sewing together, with tolerable success, the rended vesture of the Papacy; of suppressing a more popular and more Scriptural Christianity, for the benefit of his despotic order; of quenching for a time, by the extinction of Abelard, the spirit of free inquiry; and of seeing his ascetic and superhuman ideal of religion everywhere accepted as the genuine type of Christian virtue.”</p>

					<p>The Veronica is the portrait of our Saviour impressed upon a veil or kerchief, preserved with great care in the church of the Santi Apostoli at Rome. Collin de Plancy, <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="fr">Légendes des Saintes Images</i>, <abbr>p.</abbr> 11, gives the following account of it:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Properly speaking, the Veronica (<i xml:lang="la">vera icon</i>) is the true likeness of Our Lord; and the same name has been given to the holy woman who obtained it, because the name of this holy woman was uncertain. According to some, she was a pious Jewess, called Seraphia; according to others, she was Berenice, niece of Herod. It is impossible to decide between the different traditions, some of which make her a virgin, and others the wife of Zaccheus.</p>
						<p>“However this may be, the happy woman who obtained the venerable imprint of the holy face lived not far from the palace of Pilate. Her house is still shown to pilgrims at Jerusalem; and a Canon of Mayence, who went to the Holy Land in 1483, reported that he had visited the house of the Veronica.</p>
						<p>“When she saw Our Lord pass, bearing his cross, covered with blood, spittle, sweat, and dust, she ran to meet him, and, presenting her kerchief, tried to wipe his adorable face. Our Lord, leaving for an instant the burden of the cross to Simon the Cyrenean, took the kerchief, applied it to his face, and gave it back to the pious woman, marked with the exact imprint of his august countenance.”</p>
					</blockquote>
					<p>Of the Veronica there are four copies in existence, each claiming to be the original; one at Rome, another at Paris, a third at Laon, and a fourth at Xaen in Andalusia. The traveller who has crossed the Sierra Morena cannot easily forget the stone column, surmounted by an iron cross, which marks the boundary between La Mancha and Andalusia, with the melancholy stone face upon it, and the inscription, “<i xml:lang="es">El verdadero Retrato de la Santa Cara del Dios de Xaen.</i>” <a href="paradiso.xhtml#noteref-2054" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The face of the Virgin Mary. Didron, in his <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Christian Iconography</i>, <span epub:type="z3998:roman">I</span> 242, devotes a chapter to the “History of the Portraits of God the Son.” Besides the Veronica and the Santo Volto, attributed to Nicodemus, he mentions others which tradition traces back to Pilate and <abbr>St.</abbr> Luke, and a statue erected to Christ by the woman who was cured of the bloody flux. In the following extract several others are referred to:⁠—</p>
					<blockquote>
						<p>“Abgarus, king of Edessa, having learnt, says Damascenus, the wonderful things related of our Saviour, became inflamed with Divine love; he sent ambassadors to the Son of God, inviting him to come and visit him, and should the Saviour refuse to grant his request, he charged his ambassadors to employ some artist to make a portrait of our Lord. Jesus, from whom nothing is hidden, and to whom nothing is impossible, being aware of the intention of Abgarus, took a piece of linen, applied it to his face, and depicted thereon his own image. This very portrait, continues Damascenus, is in existence at the present day, and in perfect preservation.</p>
						<p>“At the same epoch, a minute verbal description of the appearance of Christ was in circulation. The following description, which is of great importance, was sent to the Roman Senate by Publius Lentulus, Proconsul of Judaea, before Herod. Lentulus had seen the Saviour, and had made him sit to him, as it were, that he might give a written description of his features and physiognomy. His portrait, apocryphal though it be, is at least one of the first upon record; it dates from the earliest period of the Church, and has been mentioned by the most ancient fathers. Lentulus writes to the Senate as follows: ‘At this time appeared a man who is still living and endowed with mighty power; his name is Jesus Christ. His disciples call him the Son of God; others regard him as a powerful prophet. He raises the dead to life, and heals the sick of every description of infirmity and disease. This man is of lofty stature, and well-proportioned; his countenance severe and virtuous, so that he inspires beholders with feelings both of fear and love. The hair of his head is of the color of wine, and from the top of the head to the ears straight and without radiance, but it descends from the ears to the shoulders in shining curls. From the shoulders the hair flows down the back, divided into two portions, after the manner of the Nazarenes; his forehead is clear and without wrinkle, his face free from blemish, and slightly tinged with red, his physiognomy noble and gracious. The nose and mouth faultless. His beard is abundant, the same color as the hair, and forked. His eyes blue and very brilliant. In reproving or censuring he is awe-inspiring; in exhorting and teaching, his speech is gentle and caressing. His countenance is marvellous in seriousness and grace. He has never once been seen to laugh; but many have seen him weep. He is slender in person, his hands are straight and long, his arms beautiful. Grave and solemn in his discourse, his language is simple and quiet. He is in appearance the most beautiful of the children of men.’</p>
						<p>“The Emperor Constantine caused pictures of the Son of God to be painted from this ancient description.</p>
						<p>“In the eighth century, at the period in which Saint John Damascenus wrote, the lineaments of this remarkable figure continued to be the same as they are to this day.</p>
						<p>“The hair and the beard, the color of which is somewhat undetermined in the letter of Lentulus, for wine may be pale, golden, red, or violet color, is distinctly noted by Damascenus, who also adds the tint of the complexion; moreover, th e opinion of Damascenus, like that of Lentulus, is decidedly in favor of the beauty of Christ, and the former severely censures the Manichaeans, who entertained a contrary opinion. Thus, then, Christ, in taking upon him the form of Adam, assumed features exactly resembling those of the Virgin Mary.⁠ ⁠… In the West, a century later than the time of Damascenus, Christ was always thus depicted. <abbr>S.</abbr> Anschaire, Archbishop of Hamburg and Bremen, who beheld Christ [in a vision], described him as ‘tall, clad in the manner of the Jews, and beautiful in face, the splendor of Divinity darted like a flame from the eyes of the Redeemer, but his voice was full of sweetness.’ ”</p>

Whatever verses the virgin has inscribed on the leaves, she ranges in harmonious order, and leaves in the cave enclosed by themselves: uncovered they remain in their position, nor recede from their order. But when, upon turning the hinge, a small breath of wind has blown upon them, and the door [by opening] hath discomposed the tender leaves, she never afterward cares to catch the verses as they are fluttering in the hollow cave, nor to recover their situation, or join them together.”</p>

					<span class="i1">A laborer, pausing in the dust and heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lay down his burden, and with reverent feet</span>

					<span class="i1">Enter, and cross himself, and on the floor</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kneel to repeat his paternoster o’er;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far off the noises of the world retreat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The loud vociferations of the street</span>

					<span class="i1">Become an undistinguishable roar.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, as I enter here from day to day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leave my burden at this minster gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kneeling in prayer, and not ashamed to pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tumult of the time disconsolate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To inarticulate murmurs dies away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While the eternal ages watch and wait.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>How strange the sculptures that adorn these towers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This crowd of statues, in whose folded sleeves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Birds build their nests; while canopied with leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Parvis and portal bloom like trellised bowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the vast minster seems a cross of flowers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But fiends and dragons on the gargoyled eaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watch the dead Christ between the living thieves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, underneath, the traitor Judas lowers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! from what agonies of heart and brain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What exultations trampling on despair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What tenderness, what tears, what hate of wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What passionate outcry of a soul in pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprose this poem of the earth and air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This medieval miracle of song!</span>

					<span>Midway upon the journey of our life<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2" id="noteref-2" epub:type="noteref">2</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the straightforward pathway had been lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in the very thought renews the fear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So bitter is it, death is little more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of the good to treat, which there I found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speak will I of the other things I saw there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot well repeat how there I entered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So full was I of slumber at the moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which I had abandoned the true way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But after I had reached a mountain’s foot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-4" id="noteref-4" epub:type="noteref">4</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At that point where the valley terminated,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-5" id="noteref-5" epub:type="noteref">5</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had with consternation pierced my heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested already with that planet’s rays<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-6" id="noteref-6" epub:type="noteref">6</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which leadeth others right by every road.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was the fear a little quieted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in my heart’s lake had endured throughout<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-7" id="noteref-7" epub:type="noteref">7</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The night, which I had passed so piteously.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as he, who, with distressful breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth issued from the sea upon the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns to the water perilous and gazes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn itself back to re-behold the pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which never yet a living person left.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-8" id="noteref-8" epub:type="noteref">8</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After my weary body I had rested,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way resumed I on the desert slope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the firm foot ever was the lower.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-9" id="noteref-9" epub:type="noteref">9</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! almost where the ascent began,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-10" id="noteref-10" epub:type="noteref">10</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A panther light and swift exceedingly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-11" id="noteref-11" epub:type="noteref">11</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with a spotted skin was covered o’er!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never moved she from before my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, rather did impede so much my way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many times I to return had turned.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-12" id="noteref-12" epub:type="noteref">12</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The time was the beginning of the morning,</span>

					<span class="i1">And up the sun was mounting with those stars<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-13" id="noteref-13" epub:type="noteref">13</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with him were, what time the Love Divine</span>

					<span>At first in motion set those beauteous things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So were to me occasion of good hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The variegated skin of that wild beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hour of time, and the delicious season;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so much, that did not give me fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lion’s aspect which appeared to me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-14" id="noteref-14" epub:type="noteref">14</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He seemed as if against me he were coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seemed the air was afraid of him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-15" id="noteref-15" epub:type="noteref">15</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-16" id="noteref-16" epub:type="noteref">16</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to be laden in her meagreness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many folk has caused to live forlorn!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She brought upon me so much heaviness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the affright that from her aspect came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I the hope relinquished of the height.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is who willingly acquires,</span>

					<span>“Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-20" id="noteref-20" epub:type="noteref">20</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I made response to him with bashful forehead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O, of the other poets honor and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Avail me the long study and great love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That have impelled me to explore thy volume!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art my master, and my author thou,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art alone the one from whom I took</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful style that has done honor to me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-21" id="noteref-21" epub:type="noteref">21</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the beast, for which I have turned back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thee it behoves to take another road,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded he, when he beheld me weeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“If from this savage place thou wouldst escape;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because this beast, at which thou criest out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suffers not any one to pass her way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But so doth harass him, that she destroys him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And has a nature so malign and ruthless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never doth she glut her greedy will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after food is hungrier than before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many the animals with whom she weds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-22" id="noteref-22" epub:type="noteref">22</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He shall not feed on either earth or pelf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-23" id="noteref-23" epub:type="noteref">23</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On whose account the maid Camilla died,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through every city shall he hunt her down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until he shall have driven her back to Hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There from whence envy first did let her loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I think and judge it for thy best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lead thee hence through the eternal place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-24" id="noteref-24" epub:type="noteref">24</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cry out each one for the second death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt see those who contented are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the fire, because they hope to come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er it may be, to the blessed people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A soul shall be for that than I more worthy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-25" id="noteref-25" epub:type="noteref">25</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With her at my departure I will leave thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that Emperor, who reigns above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that I was rebellious to his law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wills that through me none come into his city.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He governs everywhere, and there he reigns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is his city and his lofty throne;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O happy he whom thereto he elects!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Poet, I thee entreat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that same God whom thou didst never know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I may escape this woe and worse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may see the portal of Saint Peter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those thou makest so disconsolate.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he moved on, and I behind him followed.</span>

					<span>Day was departing, and the embrowned air<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-26" id="noteref-26" epub:type="noteref">26</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Released the animals that are on earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From their fatigues; and I the only one</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made myself ready to sustain the war,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of the way and likewise of the woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which memory that errs not shall retrace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Muses, O high genius, now assist me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O memory, that didst write down what I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here thy nobility shall be manifest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “Poet, who guidest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While yet corruptible, unto the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Immortal went, and was there bodily.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the adversary of all evil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was courteous, thinking of the high effect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That issue would from him, and who, and what,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To men of intellect unmeet it seems not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he was of great Rome, and of her empire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the empyreal heaven as father chosen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The which and what, wishing to speak the truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were stablished as the holy place, wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sits the successor of the greatest Peter.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-28" id="noteref-28" epub:type="noteref">28</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things did he hear, which the occasion were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of his victory and the papal mantle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-29" id="noteref-29" epub:type="noteref">29</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of salvation’s way is the beginning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I, why thither come, or who concedes it?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, if I resign myself to come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fear the coming may be ill-advised;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou ’rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is, who unwills what he willed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by new thoughts doth his intention change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that from his design he quite withdraws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, upon that dark hillside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was so very prompt in the beginning.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-30" id="noteref-30" epub:type="noteref">30</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I have well thy language understood,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied that shade of the Magnanimous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thy soul attainted is with cowardice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which many times a man encumbers so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It turns him back from honored enterprise,</span>

					<span class="i1">As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’ll tell thee why I came, and what I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first moment when I grieved for thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among those was I who are in suspense,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-31" id="noteref-31" epub:type="noteref">31</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a fair, saintly Lady called to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such wise, I besought her to command me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-32" id="noteref-32" epub:type="noteref">32</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she began to say, gentle and low,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-33" id="noteref-33" epub:type="noteref">33</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With voice angelical, in her own language:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O spirit courteous of Mantua,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom the fame still in the world endures,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shall endure, long-lasting as the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the desert slope is so impeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his way, that he has turned through terror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And may, I fear, already be so lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I too late have risen to his succor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that which I have heard of him in Heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-34" id="noteref-34" epub:type="noteref">34</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with what needful is for his release,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Assist him so, that I may be consoled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beatrice am I, who do bid thee go;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-35" id="noteref-35" epub:type="noteref">35</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I come from there, where I would fain return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I shall be in presence of my Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full often will I praise thee unto him.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then paused she, and thereafter I began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human race exceedeth all contained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the heaven that has the lesser circles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-36" id="noteref-36" epub:type="noteref">36</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So grateful unto me is thy commandment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To obey, if ’twere already done, were late;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No farther need’st thou ope to me thy wish.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The here descending down into this centre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the vast place thou burnest to return to.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-37" id="noteref-37" epub:type="noteref">37</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Briefly will I relate,’ she answered me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘Why I am not afraid to enter here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of those things only should one be afraid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have the power of doing others harm;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God in his mercy such created me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That misery of yours attains me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor any flame assails me of this burning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-38" id="noteref-38" epub:type="noteref">38</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At this impediment, to which I send thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that stern judgment there above is broken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In her entreaty she besought Lucìa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-39" id="noteref-39" epub:type="noteref">39</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said, “Thy faithful one now stands in need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lucìa, foe of all that cruel is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hastened away, and came unto the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-40" id="noteref-40" epub:type="noteref">40</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Beatrice,” said she, “the true praise of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why succorest thou not him, who loved thee so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee he issued from the vulgar herd?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost thou not see the death that combats him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-41" id="noteref-41" epub:type="noteref">41</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never were persons in the world so swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To work their weal and to escape their woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I, after such words as these were uttered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came hither downward from my blessed seat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confiding in thy dignified discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which honors thee, and those who’ve listened to it.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After she thus had spoken unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby she made me swifter in my coming;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto thee I came, as she desired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I have delivered thee from that wild beast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which barred the beautiful mountain’s short ascent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What is it, then? Why, why dost thou delay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Daring and hardihood why hast thou not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing that three such Ladies benedight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so much good my speech doth promise thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-42" id="noteref-42" epub:type="noteref">42</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplift themselves all open on their stems;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became with my exhausted strength,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And such good courage to my heart there coursed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I began, like an intrepid person:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O she compassionate, who succored me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The words of truth which she addressed to thee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the adventure, with these words of thine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to my first intent I have returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now go, for one sole will is in us both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus said I to him; and when he had moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I entered on the deep and savage way.</span>

					<span>Languages diverse, horrible dialects,</span>

					<span class="i1">Accents of anger, words of agony,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>When some among them I had recognized,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I looked, and I beheld the shade of him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-49" id="noteref-49" epub:type="noteref">49</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made through cowardice the great refusal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hateful to God and to his enemies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These miscreants, who never were alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were naked, and were stung exceedingly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By gadflies and by hornets that were there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These did their faces irrigate with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the disgusting worms was gathered up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when to gazing farther I betook me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People I saw on a great river’s bank;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence said I: “Master, now vouchsafe to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That I may know who these are, and what law</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes them appear so ready to pass over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I discern athwart the dusky light.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-50" id="noteref-50" epub:type="noteref">50</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “These things shall all be known</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing my words might irksome be to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From speech refrained I till we reached the river.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! towards us coming in a boat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-51" id="noteref-51" epub:type="noteref">51</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An old man, hoary with the hair of eld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying: “Woe unto you, ye souls depraved!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I come to lead you to the other shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the eternal shades in heat and frost.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-52" id="noteref-52" epub:type="noteref">52</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou, that yonder standest, living soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-53" id="noteref-53" epub:type="noteref">53</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he saw that I did not withdraw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said: “By other ways, by other ports</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-54" id="noteref-54" epub:type="noteref">54</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto him the Guide: “Vex thee not, Charon;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-55" id="noteref-55" epub:type="noteref">55</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is so willed there where is power to do</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which is willed; and farther question not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him the ferryman of the livid fen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all those souls who weary were and naked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their color changed and gnashed their teeth together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as they had heard those cruel words.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God they blasphemed and their progenitors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human race, the place, the time, the seed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their engendering and of their birth!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter all together they drew back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which waiteth every man who fears not God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Charon the demon, with the eyes of glede,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-56" id="noteref-56" epub:type="noteref">56</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beckoning to them, collects them all together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beats with his oar whoever lags behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-57" id="noteref-57" epub:type="noteref">57</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First one and then another, till the branch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In similar wise the evil seed of Adam</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throw themselves from that margin one by one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At signals, as a bird unto its lure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they depart across the dusky wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ere upon the other side they land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again on this side a new troop assembles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My son,” the courteous Master said to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“All those who perish in the wrath of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here meet together out of every land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ready are they to pass o’er the river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because celestial Justice spurs them on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that their fear is turned into desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This way there never passes a good soul;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hence if Charon doth complain of thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This being finished, all the dusk champaign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembled so violently, that of that terror</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The recollection bathes me still with sweat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fulminated a vermilion light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which overmastered in me every sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell.</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Broke the deep lethargy within my head<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-58" id="noteref-58" epub:type="noteref">58</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a person who by force is wakened;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round about I moved my rested eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To recognise the place wherein I was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, that upon the verge I found me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the abysmal valley dolorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That gathers thunder of infinite ululations.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-59" id="noteref-59" epub:type="noteref">59</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that by fixing on its depths my sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing whatever I discerned therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let us descend now into the blind world,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began the Poet, pallid utterly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I will be first, and thou shalt second be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who of his color was aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “How shall I come, if thou art afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who ’rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The anguish of the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who are below here in my face depicts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That pity which for terror thou hast taken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us go on, for the long way impels us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, in so far as I had power to hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were lamentations none, but only sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That tremulous made the everlasting air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this arose from sorrow without torment,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-60" id="noteref-60" epub:type="noteref">60</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the crowds had, that many were and great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of infants and of women and of men.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-61" id="noteref-61" epub:type="noteref">61</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me the Master good: “Thou dost not ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they sinned not; and if they merit had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis not enough, because they had not baptism</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if they were before Christianity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the right manner they adored not God;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And among such as these am I myself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such defects, and not for other guilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost are we, and are only so far punished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That without hope we live on in desire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because some people of much worthiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I, with desire of being certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that Faith which o’ercometh every error,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Came any one by his own merit hence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by another’s, who was blessed thereafter?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he, who understood my covert speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied: “I was a novice in this state,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I saw hither come a Mighty One,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-62" id="noteref-62" epub:type="noteref">62</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sign of victory incoronate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that of his son Abel, and of Noah,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Abraham, patriarch, and David, king,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Israel with his father and his children,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And others many, and he made them blessed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou must know, that earlier than these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never were any human spirits saved.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We ceased not to advance because he spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But still were passing onward through the forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not very far as yet our way had gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This side the summit, when I saw a fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That overcame a hemisphere of darkness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were a little distant from it still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so far that I in part discerned not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That honorable people held that place.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-63" id="noteref-63" epub:type="noteref">63</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou who honorest every art and science,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who may these be, which such great honor have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The honorable name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sounds of them above there in thy life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the meantime a voice was heard by me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“All honor be to the preeminent Poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His shade returns again, that was departed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the voice had ceased and quiet was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Four mighty shades I saw approaching us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To say to me began my gracious Master:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Him with that falchion in his hand behold,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-64" id="noteref-64" epub:type="noteref">64</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who comes before the three, even as their lord.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one is Homer, Poet sovereign;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who comes next is Horace, the satirist;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because to each of these with me applies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The name that solitary voice proclaimed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They do me honor, and in that do well.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-65" id="noteref-65" epub:type="noteref">65</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I beheld assemble the fair school</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that lord of the song preeminent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who o’er the others like an eagle soars.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they together had discoursed somewhat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They turned to me with signs of salutation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on beholding this, my Master smiled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more of honor still, much more, they did me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-66" id="noteref-66" epub:type="noteref">66</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that they made me one of their own band;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sixth was I, ’mid so much wit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus we went on as far as to the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things saying ’tis becoming to keep silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was the saying of them where I was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We came unto a noble castle’s foot,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-67" id="noteref-67" epub:type="noteref">67</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seven times encompassed with lofty walls,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Defended round by a fair rivulet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This we passed over even as firm ground;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through portals seven I entered with these Sages;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came into a meadow of fresh verdure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>People were there with solemn eyes and slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of great authority in their countenance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into an opening luminous and lofty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that they all of them were visible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There opposite, upon the green enamel,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-68" id="noteref-68" epub:type="noteref">68</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw Electra with companions many,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caesar in armor with gerfalcon eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw Camilla and Penthesilea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the other side, and saw the King Latinus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with Lavinia his daughter sat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-69" id="noteref-69" epub:type="noteref">69</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw alone, apart, the Saladin.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-70" id="noteref-70" epub:type="noteref">70</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I had lifted up my brows a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master I beheld of those who know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sit with his philosophic family.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All gaze upon him, and all do him honor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There I beheld both Socrates and Plato,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who nearer him before the others stand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Democritus, who puts the world on chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of qualities I saw the good collector,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-71" id="noteref-71" epub:type="noteref">71</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Averroes, who the great Comment made.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-72" id="noteref-72" epub:type="noteref">72</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I cannot all of them portray in full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because so drives me onward the long theme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That many times the word comes short of fact.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sixfold company in two divides;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another way my sapient Guide conducts me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to a place I come where nothing shines.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Examines the transgressions at the entrance;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If by opposing winds ’tis combated.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The infernal hurricane that never rests</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they arrive before the precipice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There they blaspheme the puissance divine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I understood that unto such a torment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The carnal malefactors were condemned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who reason subjugate to appetite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the wings of starlings bear them on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the cold season in large band and full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So doth that blast the spirits maledict;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No hope doth comfort them forevermore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not of repose, but even of lesser pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making in air a long line of themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So saw I coming, uttering lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereupon said I: “Master, who are those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People, whom the black air so castigates?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-78" id="noteref-78" epub:type="noteref">78</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The first of those, of whom intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou fain wouldst have,” then said he unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“The empress was of many languages.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To sensual vices she was so abandoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lustful she made licit in her law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To remove the blame to which she had been led.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She is Semiramis, of whom we read</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She held the land which now the Sultan rules.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The next is she who killed herself for love,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-79" id="noteref-79" epub:type="noteref">79</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-80" id="noteref-80" epub:type="noteref">80</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who at the last hour combated with Love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-81" id="noteref-81" epub:type="noteref">81</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shades did he name and point out with his finger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom Love had separated from our life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After that I had listened to my Teacher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-82" id="noteref-82" epub:type="noteref">82</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “O Poet, willingly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speak would I to those two, who go together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seem upon the wind to be so light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thou’lt mark, when they shall be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By love which leadeth them, and they will come.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the wind in our direction sways them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My voice uplift I: “O ye weary souls!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As turtledoves, called onward by desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With open and steady wings to the sweet nest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fly through the air by their volition borne,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So came they from the band where Dido is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approaching us athwart the air malign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So strong was the affectionate appeal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O living creature gracious and benignant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who visiting goest through the purple air<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-83" id="noteref-83" epub:type="noteref">83</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Us, who have stained the world incarnadine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If were the King of the Universe our friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We would pray unto him to give thee peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That will we hear, and we will speak to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While silent is the wind, as it is now.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sitteth the city, wherein I was born,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-84" id="noteref-84" epub:type="noteref">84</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the seashore where the Po descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rest in peace with all his retinue.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-85" id="noteref-85" epub:type="noteref">85</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seized this man for the person beautiful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was ta’en from me, and still the mode offends me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-86" id="noteref-86" epub:type="noteref">86</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-87" id="noteref-87" epub:type="noteref">87</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Love has conducted us unto one death;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caïna waiteth him who quenched our life!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-88" id="noteref-88" epub:type="noteref">88</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These words were borne along from them to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I had heard those souls tormented,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I bowed my face, and so long held it down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the Poet said to me: “What thinkest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I made answer, I began: “Alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then unto them I turned me, and I spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I began: “Thine agonies, Francesca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sad and compassionate to weeping make me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By what and in what manner Love conceded,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-89" id="noteref-89" epub:type="noteref">89</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That you should know your dubious desires?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she to me: “There is no greater sorrow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-90" id="noteref-90" epub:type="noteref">90</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than to be mindful of the happy time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In misery, and that thy Teacher knows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, if to recognise the earliest root</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of love in us thou hast so great desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will do even as he who weeps and speaks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One day we reading were for our delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthrall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alone we were and without any fear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full many a time our eyes together drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That reading, and drove the color from our faces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But one point only was it that o’ercame us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whenas we read of the much longed-for smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being by such a noble lover kissed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one, who ne’er from me shall be divided,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That day no farther did we read therein.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the while one spirit uttered this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other one did weep so, that, for pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I swooned away as if I had been dying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fell, even as a dead body falls.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-91" id="noteref-91" epub:type="noteref">91</a></span>

					<span>At the return of consciousness, that closed</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whichsoever way I turn, and gaze.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the third circle am I of the rain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-93" id="noteref-93" epub:type="noteref">93</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its law and quality are never new.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With his three gullets like a dog is barking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over the people that are there submerged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And belly large, and armed with claws his hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One side they make a shelter for the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not a limb had he that was motionless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my Conductor, with his spans extended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He threw it into those rapacious gullets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as that dog is, who by barking craves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to devour it he but thinks and struggles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Over the souls that they would fain be deaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We passed across the shadows, which subdues</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavy rainstorm, and we placed our feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon their vanity that person seems.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were lying prone upon the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excepting one, who sat upright as soon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he beheld us passing on before him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou that art conducted through this Hell,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to me, “recall me, if thou canst;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thyself wast made before I was unmade.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “The anguish which thou hast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seems not I have ever seen thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A place art put, and in such punishment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If some are greater, none is so displeasing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thy city, which is full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of envy so that now the sack runs over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Held me within it in the life serene.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-94" id="noteref-94" epub:type="noteref">94</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the pernicious sin of gluttony</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, sad soul, am not the only one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all these suffer the like penalty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the like sin”; and word no more spake he.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I answered him: “Ciacco, thy wretchedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The citizens of the divided city;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any there be just; and the occasion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “They, after long contention,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-95" id="noteref-95" epub:type="noteref">95</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will drive the other out with much offence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then afterwards behoves it this one fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within three suns, and rise again the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="inferno-canto-6-line-69">By force of him who now is on the coast.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-96" id="noteref-96" epub:type="noteref">96</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>High will it hold its forehead a long while,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keeping the other under heavy burdens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Howe’er it weeps thereat and is indignant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The just are two, and are not understood there;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-97" id="noteref-97" epub:type="noteref">97</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Envy and Arrogance and Avarice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here ended he his tearful utterance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I to him: “I wish thee still to teach me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make a gift to me of further speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-98" id="noteref-98" epub:type="noteref">98</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others who on good deeds set their thoughts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say where they are, and cause that I may know them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For great desire constraineth me to learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “They are among the blacker souls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A different sin downweighs them to the bottom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when thou art again in the sweet world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I pray thee to the mind of others bring me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more I tell thee and no more I answer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fell therewith prone like the other blind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Guide said to me: “He wakes no more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This side the sound of the angelic trumpet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When shall approach the hostile Potentate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one shall find again his dismal tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall hear what through eternity reechoes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So we passed onward o’er the filthy mixture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touching a little on the future life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I said: “Master, these torments here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will they increase after the mighty sentence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Return unto thy science,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-99" id="noteref-99" epub:type="noteref">99</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more it feels of pleasure and of pain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Albeit that this people maledict</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To true perfection never can attain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hereafter more than now they look to be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round in a circle by that road we went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speaking much more, which I do not repeat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came unto the point where the descent is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There we found Plutus the great enemy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-100" id="noteref-100" epub:type="noteref">100</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Rolling weights forward by main-force of chest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-104" id="noteref-104" epub:type="noteref">104</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They clashed together, and then at that point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying, “Why keepest?” and, “Why squanderest thou?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus they returned along the lurid circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On either hand unto the opposite point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouting their shameful metre evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through his half-circle to another joust;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, who had my heart pierced as it were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exclaimed: “My Master, now declare to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What people these are, and if all were clerks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These shaven crowns upon the left of us.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-105" id="noteref-105" epub:type="noteref">105</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “All of them were asquint</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In intellect in the first life, so much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there with measure they no spending made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly enough their voices bark it forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er they reach the two points of the circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where sunders them the opposite defect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clerks those were who no hairy covering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, among such as these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I ought forsooth to recognise some few,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who were infected with these maladies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Vain thought thou entertainest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The undiscerning life which made them sordid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now makes them unto all discernment dim.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever shall they come to these two buttings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These from the sepulchre shall rise again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-106" id="noteref-106" epub:type="noteref">106</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have ta’en from them, and placed them in this scuffle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er it be, no words adorn I for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of goods that are committed unto Fortune,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the human race each other buffet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all the gold that is beneath the moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever has been, of these weary souls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could never make a single one repose.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” I said to him, “now tell me also</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What is this Fortune which thou speakest of,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-107" id="noteref-107" epub:type="noteref">107</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has the world’s goods so within its clutches?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “O creatures imbecile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What ignorance is this which doth beset you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He whose omniscience everything transcends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heavens created, and gave who should guide them,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-108" id="noteref-108" epub:type="noteref">108</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every part to every part may shine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distributing the light in equal measure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He in like manner to the mundane splendors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ordained a general ministress and guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That she might change at times the empty treasures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From race to race, from one blood to another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond resistance of all human wisdom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore one people triumphs, and another</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your knowledge has no counterstand against her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She makes provision, judges, and pursues</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her governance, as theirs the other gods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her permutations have not any truce;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Necessity makes her precipitate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So often cometh who his turn obtains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this is she who is so crucified</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even by those who ought to give her praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she is blissful, and she hears it not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the other primal creatures gladsome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let us descend now unto greater woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already sinks each star that was ascending<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-109" id="noteref-109" epub:type="noteref">109</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We crossed the circle to the other bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along a gully that runs out of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water was more sombre far than perse;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-110" id="noteref-110" epub:type="noteref">110</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And we, in company with the dusky waves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made entrance downward by a path uncouth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This tristful brooklet, when it has descended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the foot of the malign gray shores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who stood intent upon beholding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of them naked and with angry look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They smote each other not alone with hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with the head and with the breast and feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the good Master: “Son, thou now beholdest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-111" id="noteref-111" epub:type="noteref">111</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The souls of those whom anger overcame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likewise I would have thee know for certain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath the water people are who sigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make this water bubble at the surface,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the eye tells thee wheresoe’er it turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fixed in the mire they say, ‘We sullen were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now we are sullen in this sable mire.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For with unbroken words they cannot say it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus we went circling round the filthy fen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A great arc ’twixt the dry bank and the swamp,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the foot of a tower we came at last.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We to the foot of that high tower had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our eyes went upward to the summit of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-113" id="noteref-113" epub:type="noteref">113</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from afar another answer them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far, that hardly could the eye attain it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, to the sea of all discernment turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said: “What sayeth this, and what respondeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That other fire? and who are they that made it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Across the turbid waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What is expected thou canst now discern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If reek of the morass conceal it not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cord never shot an arrow from itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sped away athwart the air so swift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I beheld a very little boat</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come o’er the water tow’rds us at that moment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the guidance of a single pilot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shouted, “Now art thou arrived, fell soul?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-114" id="noteref-114" epub:type="noteref">114</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For this once,” said my Lord; “thou shalt not have us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Longer than in the passing of the slough.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he who listens to some great deceit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has been done to him, and then resents it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Guide descended down into the boat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then he made me enter after him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And only when I entered seemed it laden.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-115" id="noteref-115" epub:type="noteref">115</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The antique prow goes on its way, dividing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More of the water than ’tis wont with others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While we were running through the dead canal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprose in front of me one full of mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said, “Who ’rt thou that comest ere the hour?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Although I come, I stay not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But who art thou that hast become so squalid?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thou seest that I am one who weeps,” he answered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “With weeping and with wailing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat my wary Master thrust him back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, “Away there with the other dogs!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He kissed my face, and said: “Disdainful soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That was an arrogant person in the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goodness is none, that decks his memory;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise here his shade is furious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many are esteemed great kings up there,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-116" id="noteref-116" epub:type="noteref">116</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who here shall be like unto swine in mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-117" id="noteref-117" epub:type="noteref">117</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, much should I be pleased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I could see him soused into this broth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before we issue forth out of the lake.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Ere unto thee the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such a desire ’tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little after that, I saw such havoc</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made of him by the people of the mire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still I praise and thank my God for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all were shouting, “At Philippo Argenti!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-118" id="noteref-118" epub:type="noteref">118</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that exasperate spirit Florentine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round upon himself with his own teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We left him there, and more of him I tell not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on mine ears there smote a lamentation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master said: “Even now, my son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The city draweth near whose name is Dis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the grave citizens, with the great throng.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Its mosques already, Master, clearly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-119" id="noteref-119" epub:type="noteref">119</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within there in the valley I discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were.” And he to me: “The fire eternal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That kindles them within makes them look red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we arrived within the moats profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That circumvallate that disconsolate city;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The walls appeared to me to be of iron.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-120" id="noteref-120" epub:type="noteref">120</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not without making first a circuit wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came unto a place where loud the pilot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out to us, “Debark, here is the entrance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand at the gates I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were saying, “Who is this that without death</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And my sagacious Master made a sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of wishing secretly to speak with them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little then they quelled their great disdain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Come thou alone, and he begone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who has so boldly entered these dominions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let him return alone by his mad road;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think, Reader, if I was discomforted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At utterance of the accursed words;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For never to return here I believed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my dear Guide, who more than seven times</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast rendered me security, and drawn me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From imminent peril that before me stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do not desert me,” said I, “thus undone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if the going farther be denied us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that Lord, who had led me thitherward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Fear not; because our passage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">None can take from us, it by Such is given.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But here await me, and thy weary spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comfort and nourish with a better hope;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For in this nether world I will not leave thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So onward goes and there abandons me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Father sweet, and I remain in doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For No and Yes within my head contend.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I could not hear what he proposed to them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with them there he did not linger long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere each within in rivalry ran back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They closed the portals, those our adversaries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On my Lord’s breast, who had remained without</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned to me with footsteps far between.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me: “Thou, because I am angry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever for defence within be planned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This arrogance of theirs is nothing new;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-121" id="noteref-121" epub:type="noteref">121</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For once they used it at less secret gate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-122" id="noteref-122" epub:type="noteref">122</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which finds itself without a fastening still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er it didst thou behold the dead inscription;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now this side of it descends the steep,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That is the lowest region and the darkest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And farthest from the heaven which circles all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well know I the way; therefore be reassured.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encompasses about the city dolent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where now we cannot enter without anger.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more he said, but not in mind I have it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because mine eye had altogether drawn me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The three infernal Furies stained with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who had the limbs of women and their mien,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the greenest hydras were begirt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who well the handmaids of the Queen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of everlasting lamentation knew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Behold the fierce Erinnys.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is Megaera, on the left-hand side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She who is weeping on the right, Alecto;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tisiphone is between”; and then was silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one her breast was rending with her nails;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-128" id="noteref-128" epub:type="noteref">128</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shouted looking down; “in evil hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-129" id="noteref-129" epub:type="noteref">129</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more returning upward would there be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus said the Master; and he turned me round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself, and trusted not unto my hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far as not to blind me with his own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O ye who have undistempered intellects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Observe the doctrine that conceals itself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-130" id="noteref-130" epub:type="noteref">130</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now there came across the turbid waves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The clangor of a sound with terror fraught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of which both of the margins trembled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise it was than of a wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impetuous on account of adverse heats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That smites the forest, and, without restraint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The branches rends, beats down, and bears away;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes he loosed, and said: “Direct the nerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of vision now along that ancient foam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There yonder where that smoke is most intense.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Across the water scatter all abroad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until each one is huddled in the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand ruined souls I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus fleeing from before one who on foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was passing o’er the Styx with soles unwet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From off his face he fanned that unctuous air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Waving his left hand oft in front of him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And only with that anguish seemed he weary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the Master turned; and he made sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I should quiet stand, and bow before him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He reached the gate, and with a little rod</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He opened it, for there was no resistance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O banished out of Heaven, people despised!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he began upon the horrid threshold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Whence is this arrogance within you couched?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore recalcitrate against that will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which the end can never be cut off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And which has many times increased your pain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What helpeth it to butt against the fates?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your Cerberus, if you remember well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he returned along the miry road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spake no word to us, but had the look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one whom other care constrains and goads</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than that of him who in his presence is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And we our feet directed tow’rds the city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After those holy words all confident.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within we entered without any contest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, who inclination had to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What the condition such a fortress holds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And see on every hand an ample plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of distress and torment terrible.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-131" id="noteref-131" epub:type="noteref">131</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-132" id="noteref-132" epub:type="noteref">132</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sepulchres make all the place uneven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise did they there on every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saving that there the manner was more bitter;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For flames between the sepulchres were scattered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which they so intensely heated were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That iron more so asks not any art.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All of their coverings uplifted were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from them issued forth such dire laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, what are all those people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, having sepulture within those tombs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Here are the Heresiarchs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With their disciples of all sects, and much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here like together with its like is buried;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more and less the monuments are heated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he to the right had turned, we passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the torments and high parapets.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the torments and the city wall,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>“O power supreme, that through these impious circles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turnest me,” I began, “as pleases thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speak to me, and my longings satisfy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The people who are lying in these tombs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might they be seen? already are uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The covers all, and no one keepeth guard.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “They all will be closed up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When from Jehosaphat they shall return</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here with the bodies they have left above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their cemetery have upon this side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Epicurus all his followers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-134" id="noteref-134" epub:type="noteref">134</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the body mortal make the soul;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the question thou dost put to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Good Leader, I but keep concealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thee my heart, that I may speak the less,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goest alive, thus speaking modestly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A native of that noble fatherland,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which perhaps I too molestful was.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon a sudden issued forth this sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me he said: “Turn thee; what dost thou?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="inferno-canto-10-line-32">Behold there Farinata who has risen;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-135" id="noteref-135" epub:type="noteref">135</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had already fixed mine eyes on his,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he uprose erect with breast and front</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en as if Hell he had in great despite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming, “Let thy words explicit be.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then asked of me, “Who were thine ancestors?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, who desirous of obeying was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concealed it not, but all revealed to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat he raised his brows a little upward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he: “Fiercely adverse have they been<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-136" id="noteref-136" epub:type="noteref">136</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me, and to my fathers, and my party;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that two several times I scattered them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If they were banished, they returned on all sides,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “the first time and the second;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yours have not acquired that art aright.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-137" id="noteref-137" epub:type="noteref">137</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the chin, a shadow at his side;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-138" id="noteref-138" epub:type="noteref">138</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think that he had risen on his knees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round me he gazed, as if solicitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had to see if someone else were with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But after his suspicion was all spent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping, he said to me: “If through this blind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-139" id="noteref-139" epub:type="noteref">139</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “I come not of myself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who is waiting yonder leads me here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-140" id="noteref-140" epub:type="noteref">140</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His language and the mode of punishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already unto me had read his name;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that account my answer was so full.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up starting suddenly, he cried out: “How</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saidst thou⁠—he had? Is he not still alive?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he became aware of some delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I before my answer made, supine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He fell again, and forth appeared no more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had remained, did not his aspect change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-141" id="noteref-141" epub:type="noteref">141</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And if,” continuing his first discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“They have that art,” he said, “not learned aright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fifty times shall not rekindled be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The countenance of the Lady who reigns here,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-142" id="noteref-142" epub:type="noteref">142</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Say why that people is so pitiless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against my race in each one of its laws?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “The slaughter and great carnage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-143" id="noteref-143" epub:type="noteref">143</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such orisons in our temple to be made.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his head he with a sigh had shaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“There I was not alone,” he said, “nor surely</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a cause had with the others moved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there I was alone, where everyone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consented to the laying waste of Florence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who defended her with open face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-144" id="noteref-144" epub:type="noteref">144</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I him entreated, “solve for me that knot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has entangled my conceptions here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beforehand whatsoe’er time brings with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the present have another mode.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We see, like those who have imperfect sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The things,” he said, “that distant are from us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our intellect, and if none brings it to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not anything know we of your human state.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will be our knowledge from the moment when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The portal of the future shall be closed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I, as if compunctious for my fault,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Now, then, you will tell that fallen one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still his son is with the living joined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if just now, in answering, I was dumb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell him I did it because I was thinking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already of the error you have solved me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now my Master was recalling me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would tell me who was with him there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said: “With more than a thousand here I lie;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within here is the second Frederick,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-145" id="noteref-145" epub:type="noteref">145</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-146" id="noteref-146" epub:type="noteref">146</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon he hid himself; and I towards</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He moved along; and afterward, thus going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to me, “Why art thou so bewildered?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I in his inquiry satisfied him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Let memory preserve what thou hast heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against thyself,” that Sage commanded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And now attend here”; and he raised his finger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From her thou’lt know the journey of thy life.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the left hand then he turned his feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We left the wall, and went towards the middle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along a path that strikes into a valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which even up there unpleasant made its stench.</span>

					<span>The Master thus; and unto him I said,</span>

					<span class="i1">“Some compensation find, that the time pass not</span>

					<span>Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Injury is the end; and all such end</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by force or fraud afflicteth others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because fraud is man’s peculiar vice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More it displeases God; and so stand lowest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the first circle of the Violent is;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But since force may be used against three persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In three rounds ’tis divided and constructed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbor can we</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Use force; I say on them and on their things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou shalt hear with reason manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A death by violence, and painful wounds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are to our neighbor given; and in his substance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Marauders, and freebooters, the first round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tormenteth all in companies diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man may lay violent hands upon himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his own goods; and therefore in the second</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Round must perforce without avail repent</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoever of your world deprives himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who games, and dissipates his property,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weepeth there, where he should jocund be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Violence can be done the Deity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In heart denying and blaspheming Him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by disdaining Nature and her bounty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for this reason doth the smallest round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-149" id="noteref-149" epub:type="noteref">149</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man may practise upon him who trusts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him who doth no confidence imburse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only the bond of love which Nature makes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore within the second circle nestle</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falsification, theft, and simony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Panders, and barrators, and the like filth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By the other mode, forgotten is that love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Nature makes, and what is after added,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which there is a special faith engendered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoe’er betrays forever is consumed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, clear enough proceeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This cavern and the people who possess it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, those within the fat lagoon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-150" id="noteref-150" epub:type="noteref">150</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-151" id="noteref-151" epub:type="noteref">151</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore are they inside of the red city</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not punished, if God has them in his wrath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me he said: “Why wanders so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine intellect from that which it is wont?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hast thou no recollection of those words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-153" id="noteref-153" epub:type="noteref">153</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Incontinence, and Malice, and insane</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bestiality? and how Incontinence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou regardest this conclusion well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to thy mind recallest who they are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That up outside are undergoing penance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They separated are, and why less wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Sun, that healest all distempered vision,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That doubting pleases me no less than knowing!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once more a little backward turn thee,” said I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“There where thou sayest that usury offends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Philosophy,” he said, “to him who heeds it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Noteth, not only in one place alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After what manner Nature takes her course</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Intellect Divine, and from its art;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thy Physics carefully thou notest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-154" id="noteref-154" epub:type="noteref">154</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After not many pages shalt thou find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That this your art as far as possible</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Follows, as the disciple doth the master;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that your art is, as it were, God’s grandchild.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Genesis at the beginning, it behoves<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-155" id="noteref-155" epub:type="noteref">155</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mankind to gain their life and to advance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since the usurer takes another way,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-156" id="noteref-156" epub:type="noteref">156</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nature herself and in her follower<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-157" id="noteref-157" epub:type="noteref">157</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-160" id="noteref-160" epub:type="noteref">160</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of such a kind that every eye would shun it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as that ruin is which in the flank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-161" id="noteref-161" epub:type="noteref">161</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by earthquake or by failing stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For from the mountain’s top, from which it moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some path ’twould give to him who was above;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was the descent of that ravine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the border of the broken chasm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The infamy of Crete was stretched along,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-162" id="noteref-162" epub:type="noteref">162</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who was conceived in the fictitious cow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he us beheld, he bit himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as one whom anger racks within.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Sage towards him shouted: “Peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou think’st that here may be the Duke of Athens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the world above brought death to thee?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-163" id="noteref-163" epub:type="noteref">163</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instructed by thy sister, but he comes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-164" id="noteref-164" epub:type="noteref">164</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In order to behold your punishments.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which he has received the mortal blow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Minotaur beheld I do the like;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he, the wary, cried: “Run to the passage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While he wroth, ’tis well thou shouldst descend.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus down we took our way o’er that discharge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thoughtful I went; and he said: “Thou art thinking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By that brute anger which just now I quenched.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now will I have thee know, the other time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I here descended to the nether Hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This precipice had not yet fallen down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But truly, if I well discern, a little</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before His coming who the mighty spoil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-165" id="noteref-165" epub:type="noteref">165</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembled so, that I thought the Universe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-166" id="noteref-166" epub:type="noteref">166</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world ofttimes converted into chaos;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at that moment this primeval crag</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The river of blood, within which boiling is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoe’er by violence doth injure others.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O blind cupidity, O wrath insane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That spurs us onward so in our short life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the eternal then so badly steeps us!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw an ample moat bent like a bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one which all the plain encompasses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conformable to what my Guide had said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And between this and the embankment’s foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-167" id="noteref-167" epub:type="noteref">167</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in the world they used the chase to follow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beholding us descend, each one stood still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the squadron three detached themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With bows and arrows in advance selected;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And from afar one cried: “Unto what torment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come ye, who down the hillside are descending?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master said: “Our answer will we make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That will of thine was evermore so hasty.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then touched he me, and said: “This one is Nessus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who perished for the lovely Dejanira,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-168" id="noteref-168" epub:type="noteref">168</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for himself, himself did vengeance take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-169" id="noteref-169" epub:type="noteref">169</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thousands and thousands go about the moat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near we approached unto those monsters fleet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-170" id="noteref-170" epub:type="noteref">170</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward upon his jaws he put his beard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After he had uncovered his great mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to his companions: “Are you ware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he behind moveth whate’er he touches?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And my good Guide, who now was at his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where the two natures are together joined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Replied: “Indeed he lives, and thus alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me it behoves to show him the dark valley;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Necessity, and not delight, impels us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Someone withdrew from singing Halleluja,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who unto me committed this new office;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by that virtue through which I am moving</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My steps along this savage thoroughfare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give us someone of thine, to be with us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And who may show us where to pass the ford,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who may carry this one on his back;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’tis no spirit that can walk the air.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to Nessus: “Turn and do thou guide them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warn aside, if other band may meet you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We with our faithful escort onward moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the brink of the vermilion boiling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>People I saw within up to the eyebrows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the great Centaur said: “Tyrants are these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-171" id="noteref-171" epub:type="noteref">171</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That forehead there which has the hair so black</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-172" id="noteref-172" epub:type="noteref">172</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-173" id="noteref-173" epub:type="noteref">173</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up in the world was by his stepson slain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then turned I to the Poet; and he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Now he be first to thee, and second I.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little farther on the Centaur stopped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above a folk, who far down as the throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shade he showed us on one side alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “He cleft asunder in God’s bosom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-174" id="noteref-174" epub:type="noteref">174</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heart that still upon the Thames is honored.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then people saw I, who from out the river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifted their heads and also all the chest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many among these I recognized.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-175" id="noteref-175" epub:type="noteref">175</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ever more and more grew shallower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That blood, so that the feet alone it covered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there across the moat our passage was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Even as thou here upon this side beholdest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Centaur said, “I wish thee to believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That on this other more and more declines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its bed, until it reunites itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it behoveth tyranny to groan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Justice divine, upon this side, is goading</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Attila, who was a scourge on earth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-176" id="noteref-176" epub:type="noteref">176</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and forever milks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-177" id="noteref-177" epub:type="noteref">177</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The tears which with the boiling it unseals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-178" id="noteref-178" epub:type="noteref">178</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made upon the highways so much war.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then back he turned, and passed again the ford.</span>

					<span class="i1">And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They make laments upon the wondrous trees.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master: “Ere thou enter farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that thou art within the second round,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he began to say, “and shalt be, till</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou comest out upon the horrible sand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Things that will credence give unto my speech.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-183" id="noteref-183" epub:type="noteref">183</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard on all sides lamentations uttered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And person none beheld I who might make them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think he thought that I perhaps might think</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So many voices issued through those trunks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From people who concealed themselves from us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the Master said: “If thou break off</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some little spray from any of these trees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the trunk cried, “Why dost thou mangle me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After it had become embrowned with blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It recommenced its cry: “Why dost thou rend me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Men once we were, and now are changed to trees;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even if the souls of serpents we had been.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As out of a green brand, that is on fire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-184" id="noteref-184" epub:type="noteref">184</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At one of the ends, and from the other drips</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hisses with the wind that is escaping;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from that splinter issued forth together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Had he been able sooner to believe,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Sage made answer, “O thou wounded soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What only in my verses he has seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereas the thing incredible has caused me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put him to an act which grieveth me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell him who thou wast, so that by way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of some amends thy fame he may refresh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up in the world, to which he can return.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the trunk said: “So thy sweet words allure me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I can not silent be; and you be vexed not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I a little to discourse am tempted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am the one who both keys had in keeping<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-185" id="noteref-185" epub:type="noteref">185</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Frederick’s heart, and turned them to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So softly in unlocking and in locking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from his secrets most men I withheld;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fidelity I bore the glorious office</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The courtesan who never from the dwelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Death universal and the vice of courts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Inflamed against me all the other minds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That my glad honors turned to dismal mournings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My spirit, in disdainful exultation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking by dying to escape disdain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made me unjust against myself, the just.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, by the roots unwonted of this wood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do swear to you that never broke I faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the world if one of you return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let him my memory comfort, which is lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Waited awhile, and then: “Since he is silent,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Poet said to me, “lose not the time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “Do thou again inquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concerning what thou thinks’t will satisfy me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I can not, such pity is in my heart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore he recommenced: “So may the man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do for thee freely what thy speech implores,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To tell us in what way the soul is bound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any from such members e’er is freed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wind was into such a voice converted:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“With brevity shall be replied to you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the exasperated soul abandons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The body whence it rent itself away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It falls into the forest, and no part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There like a grain of spelt it germinates.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It springs a sapling, and a forest tree;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like others for our spoils shall we return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not that any one may them revest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’tis not just to have what one casts off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forest our bodies shall suspended be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each to the thorn of his molested shade.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were attentive still unto the trunk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When by a tumult we were overtaken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same way as he is who perceives<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-186" id="noteref-186" epub:type="noteref">186</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The boar and chase approaching to his stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And two behold! upon our left-hand side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the forest every fan they broke.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who was in advance: “Now help, Death, help!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the other one, who seemed to lag too much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was shouting: “Lano, were not so alert<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-187" id="noteref-187" epub:type="noteref">187</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, perchance because his breath was failing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He grouped himself together with a bush.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behind them was the forest full of black</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-188" id="noteref-188" epub:type="noteref">188</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On him who had crouched down they set their teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him they lacerated piece by piece,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter bore away those aching members.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat my Escort took me by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And led me to the bush, that all in vain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was weeping from its bloody lacerations.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Jacopo,” it said, “of Sant’ Andrea,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-189" id="noteref-189" epub:type="noteref">189</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What helped it thee of me to make a screen?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What blame have I in thy nefarious life?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When near him had the Master stayed his steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said: “Who wast thou, that through wounds so many</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to us: “O souls, that hither come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look upon the shameful massacre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has so rent away from me my leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gather them up beneath the dismal bush;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I of that city was which to the Baptist<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-190" id="noteref-190" epub:type="noteref">190</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forever with his art will make it sad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were it not that on the pass of Arno</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some glimpses of him are remaining still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ashes left by Attila,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-191" id="noteref-191" epub:type="noteref">191</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vain had caused their labor to be done.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-192" id="noteref-192" epub:type="noteref">192</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.”</span>

				</header>
				<p>
					<span>Because the charity of my native place<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-193" id="noteref-193" epub:type="noteref">193</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Constrained me, gathered I the scattered leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gave them back to him, who now was hoarse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then came we to the confine, where disparted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second round is from the third, and where</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A horrible form of Justice is beheld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly to manifest these novel things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say that we arrived upon a plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from its bed rejecteth every plant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dolorous forest is a garland to it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All round about, as the sad moat to that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There close upon the edge we stayed our feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soil was of an arid and thick sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not of another fashion made than that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-194" id="noteref-194" epub:type="noteref">194</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By each one to be dreaded, who doth read</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which was manifest unto mine eyes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of naked souls beheld I many herds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who all were weeping very miserably,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And over them seemed set a law diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supine upon the ground some folk were lying;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And some were sitting all drawn up together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others went about continually.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those who were going round were far the more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And those were less who lay down to their torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were raining down dilated flakes of fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of the snow on Alp without a wind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As Alexander, in those torrid parts<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-195" id="noteref-195" epub:type="noteref">195</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of India, beheld upon his host</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he provided with his phalanxes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To trample down the soil, because the vapor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better extinguished was while it was single;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus was descending the eternal heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without repose forever was the dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of miserable hands, now there, now here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” began I, “thou who overcomest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All things except the demons dire, that issued</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against us at the entrance of the gate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-196" id="noteref-196" epub:type="noteref">196</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the rain seems not to ripen him?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he himself, who had become aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I was questioning my Guide about him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried: “Such as I was living, am I, dead!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if he wearied out by turns the others</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Mongibello at the swarthy forge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-197" id="noteref-197" epub:type="noteref">197</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vociferating, ‘Help, good Vulcan, help!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And shot his bolts at me with all his might,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did my Leader speak with such great force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I had never heard him speak so loud:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-198" id="noteref-198" epub:type="noteref">198</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not any torment, saving thine own rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be unto thy fury pain complete.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he turned round to me with better lip,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “One of the Seven Kings was he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God in disdain, and little seems to prize him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, as I said to him, his own despites</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are for his breast the fittest ornaments.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-199" id="noteref-199" epub:type="noteref">199</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now follow me, and mind thou do not place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As yet thy feet upon the burning sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But always keep them close unto the wood.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the wood a little rivulet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As from the Bulicamë springs the brooklet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-200" id="noteref-200" epub:type="noteref">200</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sinful women later share among them,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-201" id="noteref-201" epub:type="noteref">201</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So downward through the sand it went its way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bottom of it, and both sloping banks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were made of stone, and the margins at the side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I perceived that there the passage was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In all the rest which I have shown to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since we have entered in within the gate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose threshold unto no one is denied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So notable as is the present river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which all the little flames above it quenches.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would give me largess of the food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which he had given me largess of desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said he thereafterward, “whose name is Crete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under whose king the world of old was chaste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is a mountain there, that once was glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now ’tis deserted, as a thing worn out.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her own son; and to conceal him better,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er he cried, she there had clamors made.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-202" id="noteref-202" epub:type="noteref">202</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A grand old man stands in the mount erect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-203" id="noteref-203" epub:type="noteref">203</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who holds his shoulders turned tow’rds Damietta,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-204" id="noteref-204" epub:type="noteref">204</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His head is fashioned of refined gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of pure silver are the arms and breast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then he is brass as far down as the fork.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that point downward all is chosen iron,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more he stands on that than on the other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-205" id="noteref-205" epub:type="noteref">205</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gathered together perforate that cavern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From rock to rock they fall into this valley;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then downward go along this narrow sluice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto that point where is no more descending.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They form Cocytus; what that pool may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt behold, so here ’tis not narrated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “If so the present runnel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth take its rise in this way from our world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why only on this verge appears it to us?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thou knowest the place is round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still to the left descending to the bottom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore if something new appear to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It should not bring amazement to thy face.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I again: “Master, where shall be found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou ’rt silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sayest the other of this rain is made?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied he; “but the boiling of the red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Water might well solve one of them thou makest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="inferno-canto-14-line-136">Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-206" id="noteref-206" epub:type="noteref">206</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the souls repair to lave themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When sin repented of has been removed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he: “It is time now to abandon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wood; take heed that thou come after me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A way the margins make that are not burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And over them all vapors are extinguished.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so the brooklet’s mist o’ershadows it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From fire it saves the water and the dikes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the Flemings, ’twixt Cadsand and Bruges,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-208" id="noteref-208" epub:type="noteref">208</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fearing the flood that tow’rds them hurls itself,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-209" id="noteref-209" epub:type="noteref">209</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight;</span>

					<span>And as the Paduans along the Brenta,</span>

					<span class="i1">To guard their villas and their villages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-210" id="noteref-210" epub:type="noteref">210</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such similitude had those been made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albeit not so lofty nor so thick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever he might be, the master made them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now were we from the forest so remote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I could not have discovered where it was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even if backward I had turned myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we a company of souls encountered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who came beside the dike, and everyone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To eye each other under a new moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so towards us sharpened they their brows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As an old tailor at the needle’s eye.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus scrutinised by such a family,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By someone I was recognized, who seized</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My garment’s hem, and cried out, “What a marvel!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the scorched countenance prevented not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His recognition by my intellect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bowing down my face unto his own,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-211" id="noteref-211" epub:type="noteref">211</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I made reply, “Are you here, Ser Brunetto?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-212" id="noteref-212" epub:type="noteref">212</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “May ’t not displease thee, O my son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward return and let the trail go on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I said to him: “With all my power I ask it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if you wish me to sit down with you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will, if he please, for I go with him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O son,” he said, “whoever of this herd</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A moment stops, lies then a hundred years,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And afterward will I rejoin my band,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not dare to go down from the road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Level to walk with him; but my head bowed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I held as one who goeth reverently.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he began: “What fortune or what fate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the last day leadeth thee down here?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who is this that showeth thee the way?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Up there above us in the life serene,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “I lost me in a valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet my age had been completed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But yestermorn I turned my back upon it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one appeared to me, returning thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And homeward leadeth me along this road.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “If thou thy star do follow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If well I judged in the life beautiful.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I had not died so prematurely,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would have given thee comfort in the work.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that ungrateful and malignant people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of old time from Fesole descended,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-213" id="noteref-213" epub:type="noteref">213</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smacks still of the mountain and the granite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Old rumor in the world proclaims them blind;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-214" id="noteref-214" epub:type="noteref">214</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A people avaricious, envious, proud;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy fortune so much honor doth reserve thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One party and the other shall be hungry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their litter let the beasts of Fesole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any still upon their dunghill rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which may yet revive the consecrated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seed of those Romans, who remained there when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The nest of such great malice it became.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied I to him, “not yet would you be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In banishment from human nature placed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in my mind is fixed, and touches now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My heart the dear and good paternal image</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of you, when in the world from hour to hour</span>
					<br/>
					<span>You taught me how a man becomes eternal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how much I am grateful, while I live</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoves that in my language be discerned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What you narrate of my career I write,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keep it to be glossed with other text<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-215" id="noteref-215" epub:type="noteref">215</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This much will I have manifest to you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provided that my conscience do not chide me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whatsoever Fortune I am ready.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such hansel is not new unto mine ears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-216" id="noteref-216" epub:type="noteref">216</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master thereupon on his right cheek</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did backward turn himself, and looked at me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then said: “He listeneth well who noteth it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor speaking less on that account, I go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His most known and most eminent companions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “To know of some is well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of others it were laudable to be silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For short would be the time for so much speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Know then, in sum, that all of them were clerks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And men of letters great and of great fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the world tainted with the selfsame sin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-217" id="noteref-217" epub:type="noteref">217</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-218" id="noteref-218" epub:type="noteref">218</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one, who by the Servant of the Servants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-219" id="noteref-219" epub:type="noteref">219</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he has left his sin-excited nerves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More would I say, but coming and discoursing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can be no longer; for that I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A people comes with whom I may not be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commended unto thee be my Tesoro,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-220" id="noteref-220" epub:type="noteref">220</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which I still live, and no more I ask.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he turned round, and seemed to be of those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who at Verona run for the Green Mantle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-221" id="noteref-221" epub:type="noteref">221</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Across the plain; and seemed to be among them</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one who wins, and not the one who loses.</span>

					<span>Now was I where was heard the reverberation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-222" id="noteref-222" epub:type="noteref">222</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of water falling into the next round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to that humming which the beehives make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When shadows three together started forth,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-223" id="noteref-223" epub:type="noteref">223</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Running, from out a company that passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the rain of the sharp martyrdom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards us came they, and each one cried out:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be someone of our depraved city.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It pains me still but to remember it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He turned his face towards me, and “Now wait,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said; “to these we should be courteous.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it were not for the fire that darts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The nature of this region, I should say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That haste were more becoming thee than them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as we stood still, they recommenced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The old refrain, and when they overtook us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching for their advantage and their hold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before they come to blows and thrusts between them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct to me, so that in opposite wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His neck and feet continual journey made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, “If the misery of this soft place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began one, “and our aspect black and blistered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let the renown of us thy mind incline</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell us who thou art, who thus securely</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy living feet dost move along through Hell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naked and skinless though he now may go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of a greater rank than thou dost think;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-224" id="noteref-224" epub:type="noteref">224</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His name was Guidoguerra, and in life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much did he with his wisdom and his sword.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other, who close by me treads the sand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-225" id="noteref-225" epub:type="noteref">225</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above there in the world should welcome be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who with them on the cross am placed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-226" id="noteref-226" epub:type="noteref">226</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-227" id="noteref-227" epub:type="noteref">227</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could I have been protected from the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below I should have thrown myself among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And think the Teacher would have suffered it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as I should have burned and baked myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My terror overmastered my good will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made me greedy of embracing them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I began: “Sorrow and not disdain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did your condition fix within me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That tardily it wholly is stripped off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as this my Lord said unto me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Words, on account of which I thought within me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That people such as you are were approaching.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I of your city am; and evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your labors and your honorable names</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I with affection have retraced and heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Promised to me by the veracious Leader;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the centre first I needs must plunge.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So may the soul for a long while conduct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those limbs of thine,” did he make answer then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And so may thy renown shine after thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Valor and courtesy, say if they dwell</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within our city, as they used to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or if they wholly have gone out of it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-228" id="noteref-228" epub:type="noteref">228</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With us of late, and goes there with his comrades,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth greatly mortify us with his words.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The new inhabitants and the sudden gains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Florence, so that thou weep’st thereat already!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the three, taking that for my reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Looked at each other, as one looks at truth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If other times so little it doth cost thee,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied they all, “to satisfy another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And come to rebehold the beauteous stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it shall pleasure thee to say, ‘I was,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See that thou speak of us unto the people.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seemed as if their agile legs were wings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not an Amen could possibly be said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So rapidly as they had disappeared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I followed him, and little had we gone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the sound of water was so near us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That speaking we should hardly have been heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as that stream which holdeth its own course</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The first from Monte Veso tow’rds the East,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-229" id="noteref-229" epub:type="noteref">229</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is above called Acquacheta, ere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It down descendeth into its low bed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at Forlì is vacant of that name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reverberates there above San Benedetto</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Alps, by falling at a single leap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where for a thousand there were room enough;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-230" id="noteref-230" epub:type="noteref">230</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus downward from a bank precipitate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We found resounding that dark-tinted water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it soon the ear would have offended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had a cord around about me girt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-231" id="noteref-231" epub:type="noteref">231</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therewithal I whilom had designed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take the panther with the painted skin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After I this had all from me unloosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As my Conductor had commanded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat he turned himself to the right side,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-232" id="noteref-232" epub:type="noteref">232</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And at a little distance from the verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He cast it down into that deep abyss.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“It must needs be some novelty respond,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said within myself, “to the new signal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master with his eye is following so.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how very cautious men should be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With those who not alone behold the act,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with their wisdom look into the thoughts!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He said to me: “Soon there will upward come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man should close his lips as far as may be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because without his fault it causes shame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this my Comedy to thee I swear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So may they not be void of lasting favor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw a figure swimming upward come,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-233" id="noteref-233" epub:type="noteref">233</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Marvellous unto every steadfast heart,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-234" id="noteref-234" epub:type="noteref">234</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as he returns who goeth down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet.</span>

					<span>“Behold the monster with the pointed tail,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-235" id="noteref-235" epub:type="noteref">235</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold him who infecteth all the world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me my Guide began to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beckoned him that he should come to shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near to the confine of the trodden marble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that uncleanly image of deceit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on the border did not drag its tail.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The face was as the face of a just man,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-236" id="noteref-236" epub:type="noteref">236</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its semblance outwardly was so benign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of a serpent all the trunk beside.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The back, and breast, and both the sides it had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Depicted o’er with nooses and with shields.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With colors more, groundwork or broidery</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-237" id="noteref-237" epub:type="noteref">237</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-238" id="noteref-238" epub:type="noteref">238</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That part are in the water, part on land;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as among the guzzling Germans there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beaver plants himself to wage his war;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that vile monster lay upon the border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His tail was wholly quivering in the void,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contorting upwards the envenomed fork,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the guise of scorpion armed its point.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide said: “Now perforce must turn aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our way a little, even to that beast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We therefore on the right-hand side descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made ten steps upon the outer verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Completely to avoid the sand and flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after we are come to him, I see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little farther off upon the sand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A people sitting near the hollow place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me the Master: “So that full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Experience of this round thou bear away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now go and see what their condition is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There let thy conversation be concise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till thou returnest I will speak with him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus farther still upon the outermost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Head of that seventh circle all alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I went, where sat the melancholy folk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way, that way, they helped them with their hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now from the flames and now from the hot soil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise in summer do the dogs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not one of them I knew; but I perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That from the neck of each there hung a pouch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which certain color had, and certain blazon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-239" id="noteref-239" epub:type="noteref">239</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I gazing round me come among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-240" id="noteref-240" epub:type="noteref">240</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had the face and posture of a lion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Proceeding then the current of my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another of them saw I, red as blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Display a goose more white than butter is.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-241" id="noteref-241" epub:type="noteref">241</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who with an azure sow and gravid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-242" id="noteref-242" epub:type="noteref">242</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Emblazoned had his little pouch of white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “What dost thou in this moat?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now get thee gone; and since thou ’rt still alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that a neighbor of mine, Vitaliano,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-243" id="noteref-243" epub:type="noteref">243</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will have his seat here on my left-hand side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A Paduan am I with these Florentines;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full many a time they thunder in mine ears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming, ‘Come the sovereign cavalier,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who shall bring the satchel with three goats’ ”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-244" id="noteref-244" epub:type="noteref">244</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-245" id="noteref-245" epub:type="noteref">245</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="inferno-canto-17-line-75">His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And fearing lest my longer stay might vex</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him who had warned me not to tarry long,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward I turned me from those weary souls.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-246" id="noteref-246" epub:type="noteref">246</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found my Guide, who had already mounted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the back of that wild animal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to me: “Now be both strong and bold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now we descend by stairways such as these;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mount thou in front, for I will be midway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as he is who has so near the ague</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of quartan that his nails are blue already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trembles all, but looking at the shade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such became I at those proffered words;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But shame in me his menaces produced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which maketh servant strong before good master.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I wished to say, and yet the voice came not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I believed, “Take heed that thou embrace me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he, who other times had rescued me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In other peril, soon as I had mounted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within his arms encircled and sustained me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Now, Geryon, bestir thyself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The circles large, and the descent be little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think of the novel burden which thou hast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the little vessel shoves from shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he wholly felt himself afloat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There where his breast had been he turned his tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that extended like an eel he moved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his paws drew to himself the air.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A greater fear I do not think there was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time abandoned Phaeton the reins,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-247" id="noteref-247" epub:type="noteref">247</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-248" id="noteref-248" epub:type="noteref">248</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-249" id="noteref-249" epub:type="noteref">249</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Felt stripped of feathers by the melting wax,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His father crying, “An ill way thou takest!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than was my own, when I perceived myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sight of everything but of the monster.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By wind upon my face and from below.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard already on the right the whirlpool</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making a horrible crashing under us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was I still more fearful of the abyss;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because I fires beheld, and heard laments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw then, for before I had not seen it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The turning and descending, by great horrors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That were approaching upon divers sides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As falcon who has long been on the wing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, without seeing either lure or bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Maketh the falconer say, “Ah me, thou stoopest,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thorough a hundred circles, and alights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far from his master, sullen and disdainful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And being disencumbered of our persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sped away as arrow from the string.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-250" id="noteref-250" epub:type="noteref">250</a></span>

					<span>There is a place in Hell called Malebolge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-251" id="noteref-251" epub:type="noteref">251</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wholly of stone and of an iron color,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-252" id="noteref-252" epub:type="noteref">252</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As is the circle that around it turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Right in the middle of the field malign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which its place the structure will recount.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round, then, is that enclosure which remains</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As where for the protection of the walls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many and many moats surround the castles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The part in which they are a figure forms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just such an image those presented there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as about such strongholds from their gates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the outer bank are little bridges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from the precipice’s base did crags</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Project, which intersected dikes and moats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the well that truncates and collects them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within this place, down shaken from the back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Held to the left, and I moved on behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New torments, and new wielders of the lash,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down at the bottom were the sinners naked;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This side the middle came they facing us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the Romans, for the mighty host,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-253" id="noteref-253" epub:type="noteref">253</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have chosen a mode to pass the people over;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all upon one side towards the Castle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-254" id="noteref-254" epub:type="noteref">254</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their faces have, and go unto Saint Peter’s;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the other side they go towards the Mountain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This side and that, along the livid stone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld I horned demons with great scourges,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who cruelly were beating them behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first blows! and sooth not any one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second waited for, nor for the third.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was going on, mine eyes by one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encountered were; and straight I said: “Already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sight of this one I am not unfed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to my going somewhat back assented;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lowering his face, but little it availed him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For said I: “Thou that castest down thine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If false are not the features which thou bearest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art Venedico Caccianimico;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-255" id="noteref-255" epub:type="noteref">255</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-256" id="noteref-256" epub:type="noteref">256</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Unwillingly I tell it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But forces me thine utterance distinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes me recollect the ancient world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was the one who the fair Ghisola</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Howe’er the shameless story may be told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, rather is this place so full of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not so many tongues today are taught</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt Reno and Savena to say <i xml:lang="egl">sipa</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-257" id="noteref-257" epub:type="noteref">257</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While speaking in this manner, with his scourge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A demon smote him, and said: “Get thee gone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pander, there are no women here for coin.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I joined myself again unto mine Escort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafterward with footsteps few we came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To where a crag projected from the bank.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This very easily did we ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turning to the right along its ridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From those eternal circles we departed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-258" id="noteref-258" epub:type="noteref">258</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were there, where it is hollowed out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Guide said: “Wait, and see that on thee strike</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The vision of those others evil-born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because together with us they have gone.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the old bridge we looked upon the train</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which tow’rds us came upon the other border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And which the scourges in like manner smite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master, without my inquiring,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to me: “See that tall one who is coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for his pain seems not to shed a tear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still what a royal aspect he retains!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-259" id="noteref-259" epub:type="noteref">259</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Colchians of the Ram made destitute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He by the isle of Lemnos passed along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the daring women pitiless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had unto death devoted all their males.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There with his tokens and with ornate words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-260" id="noteref-260" epub:type="noteref">260</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such sin unto such punishment condemns him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And also for Medea is vengeance done.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him go those who in such wise deceive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this sufficient be of the first valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We were already where the narrow path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that a buttress for another arch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence we heard people, who are making moan</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their palms beating upon themselves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The margins were encrusted with a mould</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By exhalation from below, that sticks there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the eyes and nostrils wages war.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bottom is so deep, no place suffices</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To give us sight of it, without ascending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The arch’s back, where most the crag impends.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither we came, and thence down in the moat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw a people smothered in a filth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That out of human privies seemed to flow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whilst below there with mine eye I search,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw one with his head so foul with ordure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It was not clear if he were clerk or layman.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He screamed to me: “Wherefore art thou so eager</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look at me more than the other foul ones?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I to him: “Because, if I remember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have already seen thee with dry hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou ’rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-261" id="noteref-261" epub:type="noteref">261</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he thereon, belaboring his pumpkin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“The flatteries have submerged me here below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me the Guide: “See that thou thrust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy visage somewhat farther in advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with thine eyes thou well the face attain</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And crouches now, and now on foot is standing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thaïs the harlot is it, who replied<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-262" id="noteref-262" epub:type="noteref">262</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto her paramour, when he said, ‘Have I</span>

					<span>O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-264" id="noteref-264" epub:type="noteref">264</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye who the things of God, which ought to be</span>

					<span class="i1">The brides of holiness, rapaciously</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For silver and for gold do prostitute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-265" id="noteref-265" epub:type="noteref">265</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because in this third Bolgia ye abide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We had already on the following tomb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ascended to that portion of the crag</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which o’er the middle of the moat hangs plumb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with what justice doth thy power distribute!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw upon the sides and on the bottom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The livid stone with perforations filled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of one size, and everyone was round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than those that in my beautiful Saint John</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are fashioned for the place of the baptizers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of which, not many years ago,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-266" id="noteref-266" epub:type="noteref">266</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I broke for someone, who was drowning in it;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-267" id="noteref-267" epub:type="noteref">267</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be this a seal all men to undeceive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of the mouth of each one there protruded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The feet of a transgressor, and the legs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to the calf, the rest within remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In all of them the soles were both on fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore the joints so violently quivered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They would have snapped asunder withes and bands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To move upon the outer surface only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So likewise was it there from heel to point.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master, who is that one who writhes himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than his other comrades quivering,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “and whom a redder flame is sucking?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-268" id="noteref-268" epub:type="noteref">268</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “If thou wilt have me bear thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down there along that bank which lowest lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From him thou ’lt know his errors and himself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “What pleases thee, to me is pleasing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We turned, and on the left-hand side descended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master yet from off his haunch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him who so lamented with his shanks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whoe’er thou art, that standest upside down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To say began I, “if thou canst, speak out.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood even as the friar who is confessing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The false assassin, who, when he is fixed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-269" id="noteref-269" epub:type="noteref">269</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Recalls him, so that death may be delayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he cried out: “Dost thou stand there already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost thou stand there already, Boniface?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-270" id="noteref-270" epub:type="noteref">270</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By many years the record lied to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Art thou so early satiate with that wealth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, as people are who stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not comprehending what is answered them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if bemocked, and know not how to answer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said Virgilius: “Say to him straightway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I replied as was imposed on me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to me: “Then what wantest thou of me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If who I am thou carest so much to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou on that account hast crossed the bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that I vested was with the great mantle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And truly was I son of the She-bear,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-271" id="noteref-271" epub:type="noteref">271</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above, and here myself, I pocketed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath my head the others are dragged down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who have preceded me in simony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flattened along the fissure of the rock.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one shall come who I believed thou wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the sudden question I proposed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But longer I my feet already toast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And here have been in this way upside down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than he will planted stay with reddened feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For after him shall come of fouler deed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From tow’rds the west a Pastor without law,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-272" id="noteref-272" epub:type="noteref">272</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as befits to cover him and me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>New Jason will he be, of whom we read<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-273" id="noteref-273" epub:type="noteref">273</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So he who governs France shall be to this one.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-274" id="noteref-274" epub:type="noteref">274</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not know if I were here too bold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him I answered only in this metre:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before he put the keys into his keeping?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Truly he nothing asked but ‘Follow me.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-275" id="noteref-275" epub:type="noteref">275</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the place the guilty soul had lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keep safe guard o’er the ill-gotten money,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-276" id="noteref-276" epub:type="noteref">276</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And were it not that still forbids it me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The reverence for the keys superlative</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I would make use of words more grievous still;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because your avarice afflicts the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trampling the good and lifting the depraved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When she who sitteth upon many waters<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-277" id="noteref-277" epub:type="noteref">277</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fornicate with kings by him was seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The same who with the seven heads was born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And power and strength from the ten horns received,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-278" id="noteref-278" epub:type="noteref">278</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the idolater how differ ye,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not thy conversion, but that marriage-dower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-279" id="noteref-279" epub:type="noteref">279</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while I sang to him such notes as these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either that anger or that conscience stung him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He struggled violently with both his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such contented lip he listened ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the sound of the true words expressed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore with both his arms he took me up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when he had me all upon his breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remounted by the way where he descended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But bore me to the summit of the arch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There tenderly he laid his burden down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tenderly on the crag uneven and steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That would have been hard passage for the goats:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence was unveiled to me another valley.</span>

					<span class="i1">To peer down into the uncovered depth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bathed itself with tears of agony;</span>

					<span class="i1">From chin to the beginning of the chest;</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">And backward it behoved them to advance,</span>

					<span class="i1">As to look forward had been taken from them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perchance indeed by violence of palsy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Someone has been thus wholly turned awry;</span>

					<span class="i1">Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me: “Art thou, too, of the other fools?</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Opened the earth before the Thebans’ eyes;</span>

					<span class="i1">Wherefore they all cried: ‘Whither rushest thou,</span>

					<span class="i1">As far as Minos, who lays hold on all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he wished to see too far before him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind he looks, and backward goes his way:</span>

					<span>Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-284" id="noteref-284" epub:type="noteref">284</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When from a male a female he became,</span>

					<span class="i1">She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>They built their city over those dead bones,</span>

					<span class="i1">And, after her who first the place selected,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Originate my city otherwise,</span>

					<span class="i1">No falsehood may the verity defraud.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, thy discourses are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me so certain, and so take my faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto me the rest would be spent coals.</span>

					<span class="i1">We came along, and held the summit, when</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We halted to behold another fissure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Malebolge and other vain laments;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld it marvellously dark.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To smear their unsound vessels o’er again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For sail they cannot; and instead thereof</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ribs of that which many a voyage has made;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One hammers at the prow, one at the stern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was boiling down below there a dense pitch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which upon every side the bank belimed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw it, but I did not see within it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all swell up and resubside compressed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The while below there fixedly I gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Leader, crying out: “Beware, beware!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew me unto himself from where I stood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I turned round, as one who is impatient</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see what it behoves him to escape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whom a sudden terror doth unman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, while he looks, delays not his departure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld behind us a black devil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Running along upon the crag, approach.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how he seemed to me in action ruthless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With open wings and light upon his feet!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sinner did encumber with both haunches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he held clutched the sinews of the feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From off our bridge, he said: “O Malebranche,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-304" id="noteref-304" epub:type="noteref">304</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-305" id="noteref-305" epub:type="noteref">305</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plunge him beneath, for I return for others</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto that town, which is well furnished with them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All there are barrators, except Bonturo;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-306" id="noteref-306" epub:type="noteref">306</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No into Yes for money there is changed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He hurled him down, and over the hard crag</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In so much hurry to pursue a thief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other sank, and rose again face downward;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-307" id="noteref-307" epub:type="noteref">307</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the demons, under cover of the bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried: “Here the Santo Volto has no place!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-308" id="noteref-308" epub:type="noteref">308</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-309" id="noteref-309" epub:type="noteref">309</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They said: “It here behoves thee to dance covered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Immerse into the middle of the cauldron</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The meat with hooks, so that it may not float.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said the good Master to me: “That it be not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for no outrage that is done to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be thou afraid, because these things I know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For once before was I in such a scuffle.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-310" id="noteref-310" epub:type="noteref">310</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he passed on beyond the bridge’s head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as upon the sixth bank he arrived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Need was for him to have a steadfast front.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the same fury, and the same uproar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As dogs leap out upon a mendicant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who on a sudden begs, where’er he stops,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They issued from beneath the little bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned against him all their grappling-irons;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he cried out: “Be none of you malignant!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let one of you step forward, who may hear me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then take counsel as to grappling me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all cried out: “Let Malacoda go”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat one started, and the rest stood still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he came to him, saying: “What avails it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Advanced into this place,” my Master said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without the will divine, and fate auspicious?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I another show this savage road.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was his arrogance so humbled in him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he let fall his grapnel at his feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the others said: “Now strike him not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto me my Guide: “O thou, who sittest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Securely now return to me again.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the devils forward thrust themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I feared they would not keep their compact.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who issued under safeguard from Caprona,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-311" id="noteref-311" epub:type="noteref">311</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing themselves among so many foes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Close did I press myself with all my person</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From off their countenance, which was not good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They lowered their rakes, and “Wilt thou have me hit him,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They said to one another, “on the rump?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And answered: “Yes; see that thou nick him with it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the same demon who was holding parley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With my Conductor turned him very quickly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to us: “You can no farther go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forward upon this crag, because is lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it still doth please you to go onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursue your way along upon this rock;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-312" id="noteref-312" epub:type="noteref">312</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near is another crag that yields a path.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-313" id="noteref-313" epub:type="noteref">313</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yesterday, five hours later than this hour,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-314" id="noteref-314" epub:type="noteref">314</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One thousand and two hundred sixty-six</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Years were complete, that here the way was broken.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-315" id="noteref-315" epub:type="noteref">315</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I send in that direction some of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see if any one doth air himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began he to cry out, “and thou, Cagnazzo;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Farfarello and mad Rubicante;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Search ye all round about the boiling pitch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let these be safe as far as the next crag,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-316" id="noteref-316" epub:type="noteref">316</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all unbroken passes o’er the dens.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O me! what is it, Master, that I see?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pray let us go,” I said, “without an escort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou art as observant as thy wont is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with their brows are threatening woe to us?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “I will not have thee fear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let them gnash on, according to their fancy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they do it for those boiling wretches.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But first had each one thrust his tongue between<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-317" id="noteref-317" epub:type="noteref">317</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His teeth towards their leader for a signal;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he had made a trumpet of his rump.</span>

					<span class="i1">Did I see horsemen move, nor infantry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor ship by any sign of land or star.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We went upon our way with the ten demons;</span>

					<span class="i1">That they should counsel take to save their vessel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One of the sinners would display his back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in less time conceal it than it lightens.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on the brink of water in a ditch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The frogs stand only with their muzzles out,</span>

					<span class="i1">So that they hide their feet and other bulk,</span>

					<span class="i1">But ever as Barbariccia near them came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One frog remains, and down another dives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Graffiacan, who most confronted him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I knew, before, the names of all of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So had I noted them when they were chosen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when they called each other, listened how.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Rubicante, see that thou do lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried all together the accursed ones.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, see to it, if thou canst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus come into his adversaries’ hands.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near to the side of him my Leader drew,</span>

					<span class="i1">On either side, a tusk, as in a boar,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caused him to feel how one of them could rip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among malicious cats the mouse had come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to my Master he turned round his head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ask him again,” he said, “if more thou wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To know from him, before someone destroy him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide: “Now tell then of the other culprits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knowest thou any one who is a Latian,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-324" id="noteref-324" epub:type="noteref">324</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the pitch?” And he: “I separated</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lately from one who was a neighbor to it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would that I still were covered up with him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I should fear not either claw nor hook!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Libicocco: “We have borne too much”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his grapnel seized him by the arm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down at the legs; whence their Decurion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round and round about with evil look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they again somewhat were pacified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him, who still was looking at his wound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Demanded my Conductor without stay:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he replied: “It was the Friar Gomita,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-325" id="noteref-325" epub:type="noteref">325</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dealt so with them each exults thereat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Money he took, and let them smoothly off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he says; and in other offices</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-326" id="noteref-326" epub:type="noteref">326</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To gossip never do their tongues feel tired.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still farther would I speak, but am afraid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If you desire either to see or hear,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The terror-stricken recommenced thereon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let the Malebranche cease a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that these may not their revenges fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, down sitting in this very place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For one that I am will make seven come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I shall whistle, as our custom is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To do whenever one of us comes out.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shaking his head, and said: “Just hear the trick</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he, who snares in great abundance had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded: “I by far too cunning am,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I procure for mine a greater sadness.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alichin held not in, but running counter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the rest, said to him: “If thou dive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will not follow thee upon the gallop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I will beat my wings above the pitch;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The height be left, and be the bank a shield,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see if thou alone dost countervail us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each to the other side his eyes averted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He first, who most reluctant was to do it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Navarrese selected well his time;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Planted his feet on land, and in a moment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaped, and released himself from their design.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he most who was cause of the defeat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore he moved, and cried: “Thou art o’ertakern.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But little it availed, for wings could not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outstrip the fear; the other one went under,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, flying, upward he his breast directed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dives under, when the falcon is approaching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And upward he returneth cross and weary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flying behind him followed close, desirous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other should escape, to have a quarrel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the barrator had disappeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He turned his talons upon his companion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grappled with him right above the moat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To clapperclaw him well; and both of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell in the middle of the boiling pond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sudden intercessor was the heat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But ne’ertheless of rising there was naught,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To such degree they had their wings belimed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made four of them fly to the other side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all their gaffs, and very speedily</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This side and that they to their posts descended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who were already baked within the crust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in this manner busied did we leave them.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Silent, alone, and without company<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-327" id="noteref-327" epub:type="noteref">327</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We went, the one in front, the other after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As go the Minor Friars along their way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the fable of Aesop was directed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-328" id="noteref-328" epub:type="noteref">328</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My thought, by reason of the present quarrel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For <i xml:lang="it">mo</i> and <i xml:lang="lmo">issa</i> are not more alike<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-329" id="noteref-329" epub:type="noteref">329</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than this one is to that, if well we couple</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">End and beginning with a steadfast mind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as one thought from another springs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So afterward from that was born another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the first fear within me double made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did I ponder: “These on our account</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great, that much I think it must annoy them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If anger be engrafted on ill-will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They will come after us more merciless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I felt my hair stand all on end already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With terror, and stood backwardly intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When said I: “Master, if thou hidest not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am in dread; we have them now behind us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I so imagine them, I already feel them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “If I were made of leaded glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine outward image I should not attract</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooner to me than I imprint the inner.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just now thy thoughts came in among my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With similar attitude and similar face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that of both one counsel sole I made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If peradventure the right bank so slope</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we to the next Bolgia can descend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We shall escape from the imagined chase.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not yet he finished rendering such opinion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld them come with outstretched wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not far remote, with will to seize upon us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Leader on a sudden seized me up,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-330" id="noteref-330" epub:type="noteref">330</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a mother who by noise is wakened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And close beside her sees the enkindled flames,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having more care of him than of herself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that she clothes her only with a shift;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And downward from the top of the hard bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supine he gave him to the pendent rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one side of the other Bolgia walls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er ran so swiftly water through a sluice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To turn the wheel of any land-built mill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When nearest to the paddles it approaches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As did my Master down along that border,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bearing me with him on his breast away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As his own son, and not as a companion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hardly the bed of the ravine below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right over us; but he was not afraid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For the high Providence, which had ordained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To place them ministers of the fifth moat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power of thence departing took from all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A painted people there below we found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who went about with footsteps very slow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had on mantles with the hoods low down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in Cologne they for the monks are made.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-331" id="noteref-331" epub:type="noteref">331</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But inwardly all leaden and so heavy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Frederick used to put them on of straw.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-332" id="noteref-332" epub:type="noteref">332</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O everlastingly fatiguing mantle!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-333" id="noteref-333" epub:type="noteref">333</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again we turned us, still to the left hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along with them, intent on their sad plaint;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But owing to the weight, that weary folk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came on so tardily, that we were new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In company at each motion of the haunch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I unto my Leader: “See thou find</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Someone who may by deed or name be known,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus in going move thine eye about.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who understood the Tuscan speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried to us from behind: “Stay ye your feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps thou’lt have from me what thou demandest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: “Wait,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then according to his pace proceed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the burden and the narrow way delayed them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they came up, long with an eye askance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They scanned me without uttering a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to each other turned, and said together:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“He by the action of his throat seems living;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if they dead are, by what privilege</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me: “Tuscan, who to the college<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-334" id="noteref-334" epub:type="noteref">334</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of miserable hypocrites art come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to them: “Born was I, and grew up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the great town on the fair river of Arno,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-335" id="noteref-335" epub:type="noteref">335</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the body am I’ve always had.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who are ye, in whom there trickles down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along your cheeks such grief as I behold?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one replied to me: “These orange cloaks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cause in this way their balances to creak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-336" id="noteref-336" epub:type="noteref">336</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I Catalano, and he Loderingo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Named, and together taken by thy city,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the wont is to take one man alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For maintenance of its peace; and we were such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still it is apparent round Gardingo.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-337" id="noteref-337" epub:type="noteref">337</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Friars,” began I, “your iniquitous⁠ ⁠…”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One crucified with three stakes on the ground.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When me he saw, he writhed himself all over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blowing into his beard with suspirations;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-338" id="noteref-338" epub:type="noteref">338</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said to me: “This transfixed one, whom thou seest,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-339" id="noteref-339" epub:type="noteref">339</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put one man to torture for the people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Crosswise and naked is he on the path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever passes, first how much he weighs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in like mode his father-in-law is punished<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-340" id="noteref-340" epub:type="noteref">340</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within this moat, and the others of the council,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er him who was extended on the cross</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So vilely in eternal banishment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he directed to the Friar this voice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If to the right hand any pass slope down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By which we two may issue forth from here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without constraining some of the black angels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To come and extricate us from this deep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he made answer: “Nearer than thou hopest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is a rock, that forth from the great circle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-341" id="noteref-341" epub:type="noteref">341</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Save that at this ’tis broken, and does not bridge it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">You will be able to mount up the ruin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then said: “The business badly he recounted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Friar: “Many of the Devil’s vices<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-342" id="noteref-342" epub:type="noteref">342</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Once heard I at Bologna, and among them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he’s a liar and the father of lies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat my Leader with great strides went on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence from the heavy-laden I departed</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the prints of his beloved feet.</span>

					<span class="i1">The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-344" id="noteref-344" epub:type="noteref">344</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the nights draw near to half the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The outward semblance of her sister white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But little lasts the temper of her pen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The husbandman, whose forage faileth him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank,</span>

					<span>Returns in doors, and up and down laments,</span>

					<span class="i1">Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do;</span>

					<span class="i1">Then he returns, and hope revives again,</span>

					<span>Seeing the world has changed its countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In little time, and takes his shepherd’s crook,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And forth the little lambs to pasture drives.</span>

					<span>Thus did the Master fill me with alarm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld his forehead so disturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the ailment came as soon the plaster.</span>

					<span>For as we came unto the ruined bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Leader turned to me with that sweet look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which at the mountain’s foot I first beheld.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-345" id="noteref-345" epub:type="noteref">345</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>His arms he opened, after some advisement</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within himself elected, looking first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as he who acts and meditates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For aye it seems that he provides beforehand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So upward lifting me towards the summit</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “To that one grapple afterwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But try first if ’tis such that it will hold thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was no way for one clothed with a cloak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were able to ascend from jag to jag.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And had it not been, that upon that precinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shorter was the ascent than on the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He I know not, but I had been dead beat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because Malebolge tow’rds the mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the profoundest well is all inclining,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The structure of each valley doth import</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That one bank rises and the other sinks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still we arrived at length upon the point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The breath was from my lungs so milked away,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-346" id="noteref-346" epub:type="noteref">346</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was up, that I could go no farther,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master said; “for sitting upon down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Withouten which whoso his life consumes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As smoke in air or in the water foam.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore raise thee up, o’ercome the anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With spirit that o’ercometh every battle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If with its heavy body it sink not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A longer stairway it behoves thee mount;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-347" id="noteref-347" epub:type="noteref">347</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis not enough from these to have departed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I uprose, showing myself provided</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better with breath than I did feel myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Go on, for I am strong and bold.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upward we took our way along the crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more precipitous far than that before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not well adapted to articulate words.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I know not what it said, though o’er the back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I now was of the arch that passes there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was bent downward, but my living eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could not attain the bottom, for the dark;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I: “Master, see that thou arrive</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At the next round, and let us descend the wall;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-348" id="noteref-348" epub:type="noteref">348</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For as from hence I hear and understand not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So I look down and nothing I distinguish.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Other response,” he said, “I make thee not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Except the doing; for the modest asking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We from the bridge descended at its head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it connects itself with the eighth bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then was manifest to me the Bolgia;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I beheld therein a terrible throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the remembrance still congeals my blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let Lybia boast no longer with her sand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-349" id="noteref-349" epub:type="noteref">349</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Neither so many plagues nor so malignant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er showed she with all Ethiopia,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among this cruel and most dismal throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People were running naked and affrighted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the hope of hole or heliotrope.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-350" id="noteref-350" epub:type="noteref">350</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>They had their hands with serpents bound behind them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These riveted upon their reins the tail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And head, and were in front of them entwined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! at one who was upon our side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor <em>O</em> so quickly e’er, nor <em>I</em> was written,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoved it that in falling he became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when he on the ground was thus destroyed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ashes drew together, and of themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into himself they instantly returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus by the great sages ’tis confessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The phoenix dies, and then is born again,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-351" id="noteref-351" epub:type="noteref">351</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it approaches its five-hundredth year;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On herb or grain it feeds not in its life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But only on tears of incense and amomum,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is who falls, and knows not how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By force of demons who to earth down drag him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other oppilation that binds man,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-352" id="noteref-352" epub:type="noteref">352</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he arises and around him looks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was that sinner after he had risen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice of God! O how severe it is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That blows like these in vengeance poureth down!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide thereafter asked him who he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he replied: “I rained from Tuscany</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A short time since into this cruel gorge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the mule I was; I’m Vanni Fucci,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-353" id="noteref-353" epub:type="noteref">353</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I unto the Guide: “Tell him to stir not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ask what crime has thrust him here below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But unto me directed mind and face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with a melancholy shame was painted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said: “It pains me more that thou hast caught me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Amid this misery where thou seest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than when I from the other life was taken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thou demandest I cannot deny;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So low am I put down because I robbed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sacristy of the fair ornaments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And falsely once ’twas laid upon another;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou shalt e’er be out of the dark places,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-354" id="noteref-354" epub:type="noteref">354</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then Florence doth renew her men and manners;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mars draws a vapor up from Val di Magra,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-355" id="noteref-355" epub:type="noteref">355</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with impetuous and bitter tempest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over Campo Picen shall be the battle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this I’ve said that it may give thee pain.”</span>

					<span>At the conclusion of his words, the thief<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-356" id="noteref-356" epub:type="noteref">356</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-357" id="noteref-357" epub:type="noteref">357</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying: “Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that time forth the serpents were my friends;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one entwined itself about his neck</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if it said: “I will not thou speak more”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round his arms another, and rebound him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Clinching itself together so in front,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with them he could not a motion make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-358" id="noteref-358" epub:type="noteref">358</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To burn thyself to ashes and so perish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through all the sombre circles of this Hell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit I saw not against God so proud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-359" id="noteref-359" epub:type="noteref">359</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He fled away, and spake no further word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld a Centaur full of rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come crying out: “Where is, where is the scoffer?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think Maremma has so many<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-360" id="noteref-360" epub:type="noteref">360</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Serpents as he had all along his back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as where our countenance begins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wings wide open was a dragon lying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he sets fire to all that he encounters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master said: “That one is Cacus, who<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-361" id="noteref-361" epub:type="noteref">361</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created oftentimes a lake of blood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He goes not on the same road with his brothers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-362" id="noteref-362" epub:type="noteref">362</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the fraudulent theft he made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the great herd, which he had near to him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mace of Hercules, who peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While he was speaking thus, he had passed by,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spirits three had underneath us come,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-363" id="noteref-363" epub:type="noteref">363</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until what time they shouted: “Who are you?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which account our story made a halt,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-364" id="noteref-364" epub:type="noteref">364</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then we were intent on them alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not know them; but it came to pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it is wont to happen by some chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That one to name the other was compelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exclaiming: “Where can Cianfa have remained?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-365" id="noteref-365" epub:type="noteref">365</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I, so that the Leader might attend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward from chin to nose my finger laid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I shall say, it will no marvel be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I who saw it hardly can admit it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I was holding raised on them my brows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of one, and fastens wholly on him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With middle feet it bound him round the paunch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the forward ones his arms it seized;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And put its tail through in between the two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And up behind along the reins outspread it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ivy was never fastened by its barbs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the other’s limbs entwined its own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had been made, and intermixed their color;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor one nor other seemed now what he was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as proceedeth on before the flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward along the paper a brown color,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-366" id="noteref-366" epub:type="noteref">366</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is not black as yet, and the white dies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other two looked on, and each of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out: “O me, Agnello, how thou changest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold, thou now art neither two nor one.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already the two heads had one become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When there appeared to us two figures mingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into one face, wherein the two were lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-367" id="noteref-367" epub:type="noteref">367</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Members became that never yet were seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Every original aspect there was cancelled;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-368" id="noteref-368" epub:type="noteref">368</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two and yet none did the perverted image</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appear, and such departed with slow pace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a lizard, under the great scourge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of days canicular, exchanging hedge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lightning appeareth if the road it cross;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the two others, a small fiery serpent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-369" id="noteref-369" epub:type="noteref">369</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Livid and black as is a peppercorn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in that part whereat is first received</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our aliment, it one of them transfixed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then downward fell in front of him extended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He at the serpent gazed, and it at him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One through the wound, the other through the mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-370" id="noteref-370" epub:type="noteref">370</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-371" id="noteref-371" epub:type="noteref">371</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For if him to a snake, her to fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because two natures never front to front</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has he transmuted, so that both the forms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To interchange their matter ready were.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Together they responded in such wise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eke the wounded drew his feet together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The legs together with the thighs themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adhered so, that in little time the juncture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No sign whatever made that was apparent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He with the cloven tail assumed the figure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other one was losing, and his skin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became elastic, and the other’s hard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And both feet of the reptile, that were short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lengthen as much as those contracted were.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became the member that a man conceals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of his own the wretch had two created.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While both of them the exhalation veils</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a new color, and engenders hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On one of them and depilates the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The one uprose and down the other fell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though turning not away their impious lamps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Underneath which each one his muzzle changed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who was standing drew it tow’rds the temples,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from excess of matter, which came thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What did not backward run and was retained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that excess made to the face a nose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the lips thickened far as was befitting.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And backward draws the ears into his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the same manner as the snail its horns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so the tongue, which was entire and apt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul, which to a reptile had been changed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the valley hissing takes to flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after him the other speaking sputters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said to the other: “I’ll have Buoso run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crawling as I have done, along this road.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this way I beheld the seventh ballast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The novelty, if aught my pen transgress.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-372" id="noteref-372" epub:type="noteref">372</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They could not flee away so secretly</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he it was who sole of three companions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which came in the beginning, was not changed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-373" id="noteref-373" epub:type="noteref">373</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the thieves five citizens of thine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-375" id="noteref-375" epub:type="noteref">375</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou thereby to no great honor risest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if when morn is near our dreams are true,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-376" id="noteref-376" epub:type="noteref">376</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feel shalt thou in a little time from now</span>

					<span class="i1">What Prato, if none other, craves for thee.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-377" id="noteref-377" epub:type="noteref">377</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it now were, it were not too soon;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-378" id="noteref-378" epub:type="noteref">378</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would that it were, seeing it needs must be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ’twill aggrieve me more the more I age.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We went our way, and up along the stairs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bourns had made us to descend before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remounted my Conductor and drew me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And following the solitary path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the rocks and ridges of the crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The foot without the hand sped not at all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I direct my mind to what I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more my genius curb than I am wont,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it may run not unless virtue guide it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that if some good star, or better thing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-379" id="noteref-379" epub:type="noteref">379</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-380" id="noteref-380" epub:type="noteref">380</a></span>

					<span>As many as the hind (who on the hill</span>

					<span class="i1">Rests at the time when he who lights the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His countenance keeps least concealed from us,</span>

					<span>While as the fly gives place unto the gnat)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With flames as manifold resplendent all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as I was where the depth appeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as he who with the bears avenged him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-381" id="noteref-381" epub:type="noteref">381</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld Elijah’s chariot at departing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-382" id="noteref-382" epub:type="noteref">382</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with his eye he could not follow it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So as to see aught else than flame alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a little cloud ascending upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was moving; for not one reveals the theft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every flame a sinner steals away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, if I had seized not on a rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down had I fallen without being pushed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Leader, who beheld me so attent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaimed: “Within the fires the spirits are;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My Master,” I replied, “by hearing thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I am more sure; but I surmised already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It might be so, and already wished to ask thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At top, it seems uprising from the pyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="inferno-canto-26-line-54">Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-383" id="noteref-383" epub:type="noteref">383</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered me: “Within there are tormented</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-384" id="noteref-384" epub:type="noteref">384</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They unto vengeance run as unto wrath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there within their flame do they lament</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ambush of the horse, which made the door<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-385" id="noteref-385" epub:type="noteref">385</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence issued forth the Romans’ gentle seed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Deidamia still deplores Achilles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-386" id="noteref-386" epub:type="noteref">386</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pain for the Palladium there is borne.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-387" id="noteref-387" epub:type="noteref">387</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If they within those sparks possess the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak,” I said, “thee, Master, much I pray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou make no denial of awaiting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the horned flame shall hither come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Worthy is thy entreaty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of much applause, and therefore I accept it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Leave me to speak, because I have conceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which thou wishest; for they might disdain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-388" id="noteref-388" epub:type="noteref">388</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When now the flame had come unto that point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where to my Leader it seemed time and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After this fashion did I hear him speak:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O ye, who are twofold within one fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I deserved of you, while I was living,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I deserved of you or much or little</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in the world I wrote the lofty verses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not move on, but one of you declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whither, being lost, he went away to die.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then of the antique flame the greater horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Murmuring, began to wave itself about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward, the summit to and fro</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving as if it were the tongue that spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It uttered forth a voice, and said: “When I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Circe had departed, who concealed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than a year there near unto Gaëta,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet Aeneas named it so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For my old father, nor the due affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which joyous should have made Penelope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Could overcome within me the desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had to be experienced of the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the vice and virtue of mankind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I put forth on the high open sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With one sole ship, and that small company</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which I never had deserted been.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the others which that sea bathes round about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I and my company were old and slow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When at that narrow passage we arrived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-389" id="noteref-389" epub:type="noteref">389</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That man no farther onward should adventure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the right hand behind me left I Seville,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the other already had left Ceuta.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perils,’ I said, ‘have come unto the West,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To this so inconsiderable vigil</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which is remaining of your senses still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Following the sun, of the unpeopled world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ye were not made to live like unto brutes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So eager did I render my companions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this brief exhortation, for the voyage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That then I hardly could have held them back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And having turned our stern unto the morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We of the oars made wings for our mad flight,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-390" id="noteref-390" epub:type="noteref">390</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Evermore gaining on the larboard side.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already all the stars of the other pole<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-391" id="noteref-391" epub:type="noteref">391</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The night beheld, and ours so very low</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It did not rise above the ocean floor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Five times rekindled and as many quenched</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had been the splendor underneath the moon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since we had entered into the deep pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When there appeared to us a mountain, dim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From distance, and it seemed to me so high</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I had never any one beheld.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For out of the new land a whirlwind rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And smote upon the fore part of the ship.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three times it made it whirl with all the waters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the fourth time it made the stern uplift,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the prow downward go, as pleased Another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until the sea above us closed again.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-392" id="noteref-392" epub:type="noteref">392</a></span>

					<span class="i1">By a confused sound that issued from it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-394" id="noteref-394" epub:type="noteref">394</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the lament of him, and that was right,</span>

					<span>Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted,</span>

					<span class="i1">That, notwithstanding it was made of brass,</span>

					<span>Thus, by not having any way or issue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At first from out the fire, to its own language</span>

					<span class="i1">Converted were the melancholy words.</span>

					<span class="i1">Up through the point, giving it that vibration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tongue had given them in their passage out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We heard it said: “O thou, at whom I aim</span>

					<span class="i1">Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning.</span>

					<span>If thou but lately into this blind world</span>

					<span>I still was downward bent and listening,</span>

					<span class="i1">Saying: “Speak thou: this one a Latian is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who had beforehand my reply</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In readiness, forthwith began to speak:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way and that, and then gave forth such breath:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I believed that my reply were made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To one who to the world would e’er return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This flame without more flickering would stand still;</span>

					<span class="i1">That to the ends of earth the sound went forth.</span>

					<span class="i1">To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-407" id="noteref-407" epub:type="noteref">407</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which before had pleased me then displeased me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And penitent and confessing I surrendered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Leader of the modern Pharisees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having a war near unto Lateran,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-408" id="noteref-408" epub:type="noteref">408</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not with Saracens nor with the Jews,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For each one of his enemies was Christian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And none of them had been to conquer Acre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor merchandising in the Sultan’s land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In him regarded, nor in me that cord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which used to make those girt with it more meagre;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-409" id="noteref-409" epub:type="noteref">409</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To cure his leprosy, within Soracte,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So this one sought me out as an adept<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-410" id="noteref-410" epub:type="noteref">410</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To cure him of the fever of his pride.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because his words appeared inebriate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then he said: ‘Be not thy heart afraid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How to raze Palestrina to the ground.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-411" id="noteref-411" epub:type="noteref">411</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which my predecessor held not dear.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-412" id="noteref-412" epub:type="noteref">412</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then urged me on his weighty arguments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There, where my silence was the worst advice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said I: ‘Father, since thou washest me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of that sin into which I now must fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The promise long with the fulfilment short</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Francis came afterward, when I was dead,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For me; but one of the black Cherubim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to him: ‘Take him not; do me no wrong;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He must come down among my servitors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he gave the fraudulent advice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which time forth I have been at his hair;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For who repents not cannot be absolved,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-413" id="noteref-413" epub:type="noteref">413</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor can one both repent and will at once,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of the contradiction which consents not.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O miserable me! how I did shudder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he seized on me, saying: ‘Peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst not think that I was a logician!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He bore me unto Minos, who entwined</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eight times his tail about his stubborn back,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after he had bitten it in great rage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said: ‘Of the thievish fire a culprit this’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And vested thus in going I bemoan me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it had thus completed its recital,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flame departed uttering lamentations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up o’er the crag above another arch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By those who, sowing discord, win their burden.</span>

					<span class="i1">By reason of our speech and memory,</span>

					<br/>

					<span>And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should show, it would be nothing to compare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A cask by losing centre-piece or cant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was never shattered so, as I saw one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between his legs were hanging down his entrails;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His heart was visible, and the dismal sack</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That maketh excrement of what is eaten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was all absorbed in seeing him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He looked at me, and opened with his hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His bosom, saying: “See now how I rend me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How mutilated, see, is Mahomet;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-421" id="noteref-421" epub:type="noteref">421</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me doth Ali weeping go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the others whom thou here beholdest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disseminators of scandal and of schism</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While living were, and therefore are cleft thus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus cruelly, unto the falchion’s edge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Putting again each one of all this ream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we have gone around the doleful road;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason that our wounds are closed again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere any one in front of him repass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who art thou, that musest on the crag,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance to postpone going to the pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is adjudged upon thine accusations?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master made reply, “to be tormented;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to procure him full experience,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this is true as that I speak to thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a hundred were there when they heard him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the moat stood still to look at me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through wonderment oblivious of their torture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-422" id="noteref-422" epub:type="noteref">422</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If soon he wish not here to follow me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with provisions, that no stress of snow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May give the victory to the Novarese,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-423" id="noteref-423" epub:type="noteref">423</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After one foot to go away he lifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This word did Mahomet say unto me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another one, who had his throat pierced through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nose cut off close underneath the brows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And had no longer but a single ear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Staying to look in wonder with the others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the others did his gullet open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which outwardly was red in every part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whom I once saw up in Latian land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless too great similitude deceive me,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Cast over from their vessel shall they be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drowned near unto the Cattolica,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the betrayal of a tyrant fell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Neptune ne’er yet beheld so great a crime,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Neither of pirates nor Argolic people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That traitor, who sees only with one eye,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-427" id="noteref-427" epub:type="noteref">427</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And holds the land, which someone here with me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-428" id="noteref-428" epub:type="noteref">428</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would fain be fasting from the vision of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will make them come unto a parley with him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then will do so, that to Focara’s wind<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-429" id="noteref-429" epub:type="noteref">429</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Show to me and declare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who is this person of the bitter vision.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one of his companions, and his mouth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oped, crying: “This is he, and he speaks not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one, being banished, every doubt submerged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Caesar by affirming the forearmed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Always with detriment allowed delay.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O how bewildered unto me appeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Curio, who in speaking was so bold!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-430" id="noteref-430" epub:type="noteref">430</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who both his hands dissevered had,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stumps uplifting through the murky air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the blood made horrible his face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cried out: “Thou shalt remember Mosca also,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-431" id="noteref-431" epub:type="noteref">431</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who said, alas! ‘A thing done has an end!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And death unto thy race,” thereto I added;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he, accumulating woe on woe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Departed, like a person sad and crazed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I remained to look upon the crowd;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw a thing which I should be afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without some further proof, even to recount,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it were not that conscience reassures me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That good companion which emboldens man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I truly saw, and still I seem to see it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A trunk without a head walk in like manner</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As walked the others of the mournful herd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the hair it held the head dissevered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that upon us gazed and said: “O me!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It of itself made to itself a lamp,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they were two in one, and one in two;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How that can be, He knows who so ordains it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When it was come close to the bridge’s foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It lifted high its arm with all the head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring more closely unto us its words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which were: “Behold now the sore penalty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold if any be as great as this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so that thou may carry news of me,</span>

					<span class="i1">Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-433" id="noteref-433" epub:type="noteref">433</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made the father and the son rebellious;</span>

					<span class="i1">Achitophel not more with Absalom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-434" id="noteref-434" epub:type="noteref">434</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And David did with his accursed goadings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because I parted persons so united,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Parted do I now bear my brain, alas!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From its beginning, which is in this trunk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These eyes of mine had so inebriated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they were wishful to stand still and weep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But said Virgilius: “What dost thou still gaze at?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why is thy sight still riveted down there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the mournful, mutilated shades?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consider, if to count them thou believest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the moon is underneath our feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforth the time allotted us is brief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more is to be seen than what thou seest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thou hadst,” I made answer thereupon,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Attended to the cause for which I looked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I went, already making my reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And superadding: “In that cavern where</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I held mine eyes with such attention fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think a spirit of my blood laments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sin which down below there costs so much.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said the Master: “Be no longer broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy thought from this time forward upon him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For him I saw below the little bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-436" id="noteref-436" epub:type="noteref">436</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So wholly at that time wast thou impeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By him who formerly held Altaforte,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-437" id="noteref-437" epub:type="noteref">437</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my Conductor, his own violent death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is not yet avenged for him,” I said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“By any who is sharer in the shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Made him disdainful; whence he went away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I imagine, without speaking to me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-438" id="noteref-438" epub:type="noteref">438</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thereby made me pity him the more.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-439" id="noteref-439" epub:type="noteref">439</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did we speak as far as the first place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the crag, which the next valley shows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down to the bottom, if there were more light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were now right over the last cloister</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could manifest themselves unto our sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Divers lamentings pierced me through and through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with compassion had their arrows barbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What pain would be, if from the hospitals<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-440" id="noteref-440" epub:type="noteref">440</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Valdichiana, ’twixt July and September,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of Maremma and Sardinia</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All the diseases in one moat were gathered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was it here, and such a stench came from it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We had descended on the furthest bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the long crag, upon the left hand still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then more vivid was my power of sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down tow’rds the bottom, where the ministress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high Lord, Justice infallible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Punishes forgers, which she here records.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-441" id="noteref-441" epub:type="noteref">441</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think a sadder sight to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was in Aegina the whole people sick,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-442" id="noteref-442" epub:type="noteref">442</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(When was the air so full of pestilence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The animals, down to the little worm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All fell, and afterwards the ancient people,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According as the poets have affirmed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were from the seed of ants restored again,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than was it to behold through that dark valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The spirits languishing in divers heaps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This on the belly, that upon the back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One of the other lay, and others crawling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shifted themselves along the dismal road.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We step by step went onward without speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazing upon and listening to the sick</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw two sitting leaned against each other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As leans in heating platter against platter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From head to foot bespotted o’er with scabs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And never saw I plied a currycomb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By stable-boy for whom his master waits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or him who keeps awake unwillingly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As everyone was plying fast the bite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of nails upon himself, for the great rage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of itching which no other succor had.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the nails downward with them dragged the scab,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fashion as a knife the scales of bream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or any other fish that has them largest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began my Leader unto one of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And makest of them pincers now and then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me if any Latian is with those<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-443" id="noteref-443" epub:type="noteref">443</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To all eternity unto this work.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of us here,” one weeping made reply;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But who art thou, that questionest about us?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the Guide: “One am I who descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down with this living man from cliff to cliff,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I intend to show Hell unto him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then broken was their mutual support,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And trembling each one turned himself to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With others who had heard him by rebound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wholly to me did the good Master gather,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Say unto them whate’er thou wishest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I began, since he would have it so:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So may your memory not steal away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the first world from out the minds of men,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But so may it survive ’neath many suns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say to me who ye are, and of what people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let not your foul and loathsome punishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I of Arezzo was,” one made reply,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-444" id="noteref-444" epub:type="noteref">444</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And Albert of Siena had me burned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what I died for does not bring me here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I could rise by flight into the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who had conceit, but little wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Would have me show to him the art; and only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because no Daedalus I made him, made me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-445" id="noteref-445" epub:type="noteref">445</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be burned by one who held him as his son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But unto the last Bolgia of the ten,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For alchemy, which in the world I practised,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the Poet said I: “Now was ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So vain a people as the Sienese?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-446" id="noteref-446" epub:type="noteref">446</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not for a certainty the French by far.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the other leper, who had heard me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied unto my speech: “Taking out Stricca,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-447" id="noteref-447" epub:type="noteref">447</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who knew the art of moderate expenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Niccolò, who the luxurious use</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cloves discovered earliest of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within that garden where such seed takes root;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And taking out the band, among whom squandered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caccia d’ Ascian his vineyards and vast woods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, that thou know who thus doth second thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the Sienese, make sharp thine eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds me, so that my face well answer thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shalt see I am Capocchio’s shade,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-448" id="noteref-448" epub:type="noteref">448</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who metals falsified by alchemy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou must remember, if I well descry thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I a skilful ape of nature was.”</span>

					<span>’Twas at the time when Juno was enraged,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-449" id="noteref-449" epub:type="noteref">449</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Semele, against the Theban blood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As she already more than once had shown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So reft of reason Athamas became,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-450" id="noteref-450" epub:type="noteref">450</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, seeing his own wife with children twain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Walking encumbered upon either hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried: “Spread out the nets, that I may take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lioness and her whelps upon the passage”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then extended his unpitying claws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the time when fortune downward hurled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Trojan’s arrogance, that all things dared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the king was with his kingdom crushed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-451" id="noteref-451" epub:type="noteref">451</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When lifeless she beheld Polyxena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of her Polydorus on the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of ocean was the dolorous one aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of her senses like a dog she barked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much the anguish had her mind distorted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were ever seen in any one so cruel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In goading beasts, and much more human members,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I beheld two shadows pale and naked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, biting, in the manner ran along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One to Capocchio came, and by the nape</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It made his belly grate the solid bottom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Aretine, who trembling had remained,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-452" id="noteref-452" epub:type="noteref">452</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to me: “That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And raving goes thus harrying other people.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I to him, “so may not the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “That is the ancient ghost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond all rightful love her father’s lover.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She came to sin with him after this manner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By counterfeiting of another’s form;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he who goeth yonder undertook,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-453" id="noteref-453" epub:type="noteref">453</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That he might gain the lady of the herd,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making a will and giving it due form.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And after the two maniacs had passed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look upon the other evil-born.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw one made in fashion of a lute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he had only had the groin cut off</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just at the point at which a man is forked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The limbs with humors, which it ill concocts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the face corresponds not to the belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compelled him so to hold his lips apart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As does the hectic, who because of thirst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One tow’rds the chin, the other upward turns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O ye, who without any torment are,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to us, “behold, and be attentive</span>

					<span>The rivulets, that from the verdant hills<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-455" id="noteref-455" epub:type="noteref">455</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Cassentin descend down into Arno,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-456" id="noteref-456" epub:type="noteref">456</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making their channels to be cold and moist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ever before me stand, and not in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For far more doth their image dry me up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the disease which strips my face of flesh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rigid justice that chastises me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Draweth occasion from the place in which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is Romena, where I counterfeited<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-457" id="noteref-457" epub:type="noteref">457</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The currency imprinted with the Baptist,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which I left my body burned above.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if I here could see the tristful soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Branda’s fount I would not give the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One is within already, if the raving</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shades that are going round about speak truth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I were only still so light, that in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hundred years I could advance one inch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I had already started on the way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeking him out among this squalid folk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although the circuit be eleven miles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-458" id="noteref-458" epub:type="noteref">458</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And be not less than half a mile across.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For them am I in such a family;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They did induce me into coining florins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had three carats of impurity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Who are the two poor wretches</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I found them here,” replied he, “when I rained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into this chasm, and since they have not turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor do I think they will for evermore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One the false woman is who accused Joseph,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-459" id="noteref-459" epub:type="noteref">459</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-460" id="noteref-460" epub:type="noteref">460</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From acute fever they send forth such reek.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them, who felt himself annoyed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At being, peradventure, named so darkly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It gave a sound, as if it were a drum;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-461" id="noteref-461" epub:type="noteref">461</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Master Adam smote him in the face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With arm that did not seem to be less hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying to him: “Although be taken from me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All motion, for my limbs that heavy are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I have an arm unfettered for such need.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat he answer made: “When thou didst go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dropsical: “Thou sayest true in that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thou wast not so true a witness there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said Sinon; “and for one fault I am here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou for more than any other demon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Remember, perjurer, about the horse,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He made reply who had the swollen belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy tongue,” the Greek said, “and the putrid water</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then the false-coiner: “So is gaping wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mouth for speaking evil, as ’tis wont;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast the burning and the head that aches,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-462" id="noteref-462" epub:type="noteref">462</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In listening to them was I wholly fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When said the Master to me: “Now just look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When him I heard in anger speak to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I turned me round towards him with such shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still it eddies through my memory.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he is who dreams of his own harm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he craves what is, as if it were not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, not having power to speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to excuse myself I wished, and still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excused myself, and did not think I did it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, “than this of thine has been;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make account that I am aye beside thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er it come to pass that fortune bring thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where there are people in a like dispute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Short while my head turned thitherward I held</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When many lofty towers I seemed to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I: “Master, say, what town is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Because thou peerest forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Athwart the darkness at too great a distance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It happens that thou errest in thy fancy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How much the sense deceives itself by distance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore a little faster spur thee on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then tenderly he took me by the hand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Before we farther have advanced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the reality may seem to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they are in the well, around the bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From navel downward, one and all of them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, when the fog is vanishing away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Little by little doth the sight refigure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er the mist that crowds the air conceals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, piercing through the dense and darksome air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More and more near approaching tow’rd the verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My error fled, and fear came over me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because as on its circular parapets</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Montereggione crowns itself with towers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-467" id="noteref-467" epub:type="noteref">467</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en thus the margin which surrounds the well</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With one half of their bodies turreted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en now from out the heavens when he thunders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I of one already saw the face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And down along his sides both of the arms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certainly Nature, when she left the making</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of animals like these, did well indeed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By taking such executors from Mars;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if of elephants and whales she doth not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More just and more discreet will hold her for it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For where the argument of intellect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is added unto evil will and power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No rampart can the people make against it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His face appeared to me as long and large</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter’s,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-468" id="noteref-468" epub:type="noteref">468</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in proportion were the other bones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the margin, which an apron was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down from the middle, showed so much of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above it, that to reach up to his hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For I beheld thirty great palms of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down from the place where man his mantle buckles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Raphel mai amech izabi almi,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-469" id="noteref-469" epub:type="noteref">469</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to clamor the ferocious mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which were not befitting sweeter psalms.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto him my Guide: “Soul idiotic,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When wrath or other passion touches thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me: “He doth himself accuse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-470" id="noteref-470" epub:type="noteref">470</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One language in the world is not still used.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here let us leave him and not speak in vain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For even such to him is every language</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As his to others, which to none is known.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore a longer journey did we make,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot off</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We found another far more fierce and large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In binding him, who might the master be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I cannot say; but he had pinioned close</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind the right arm, and in front the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With chains, that held him so begirt about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the neck down, that on the part uncovered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This proud one wished to make experiment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Leader said, “whence he has such a guerdon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-471" id="noteref-471" epub:type="noteref">471</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the giants terrified the Gods;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The arms he wielded never more he moves.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “If possible, I should wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of the measureless Briareus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-472" id="noteref-472" epub:type="noteref">472</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These eyes of mine might have experience.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he replied: “Thou shalt behold Antaeus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-473" id="noteref-473" epub:type="noteref">473</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close by here, who can speak and is unbound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There never was an earthquake of such might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it could shake a tower so violently,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then was I more afraid of death than ever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For nothing more was needful than the fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I had not beheld the manacles.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we proceeded farther in advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the head, forth issued from the cavern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou, who in the valley fortunate,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-474" id="noteref-474" epub:type="noteref">474</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Scipio the heir of glory made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once brought’st a thousand lions for thy prey,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among thy brothers, some it seems still think</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sons of Earth the victory would have gained;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Place us below, nor be disdainful of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-475" id="noteref-475" epub:type="noteref">475</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one can give of that which here is longed for;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still in the world can he restore thy fame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because he lives, and still expects long life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If to itself Grace call him not untimely.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So said the Master; and in haste the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His hands extended and took up my Guide⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-476" id="noteref-476" epub:type="noteref">476</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Draw nigh, that I may take thee”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then of himself and me one bundle made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As seems the Carisenda, to behold<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-477" id="noteref-477" epub:type="noteref">477</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above it so that opposite it hangs;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching to see him stoop, and then it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I could have wished to go some other way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Judas with Lucifer, he put us down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose.</span>

					<br/>
					<span>But may those Ladies help this verse of mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-481" id="noteref-481" epub:type="noteref">481</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the fact the word be not diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O rabble ill-begotten above all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who’re in the place to speak of which is hard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-482" id="noteref-482" epub:type="noteref">482</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were down within the darksome well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the giant’s feet, but lower far,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was scanning still the lofty wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard it said to me: “Look how thou steppest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And underfoot a lake, that from the frost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The semblance had of glass, and not of water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So thick a veil ne’er made upon its current</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In winter-time Danube in Austria,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As there was here; so that if Tambernich<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-483" id="noteref-483" epub:type="noteref">483</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en at the edge ’twould not have given a creak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as to croak the frog doth place himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With muzzle out of water⁠—when is dreaming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Livid, as far down as where shame appears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were the disconsolate shades within the ice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Setting their teeth unto the note of storks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one his countenance held downward bent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among them witness of itself procures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When round about me somewhat I had looked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I downward turned me, and saw two so close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hair upon their heads together mingled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “who are you”; and they bent their necks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when to me their faces they had lifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their eyes, which first were only moist within,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gushed o’er the eyelids, and the frost congealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tears between, and locked them up again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clamp never bound together wood with wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Butted together, so much wrath o’ercame them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one, who had by reason of the cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If thou desire to know who these two are,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-484" id="noteref-484" epub:type="noteref">484</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The valley whence Bisenzio descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Belonged to them and to their father Albert.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They from one body came, and all Caïna<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-485" id="noteref-485" epub:type="noteref">485</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More worthy to be fixed in gelatine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At one and the same blow by Arthur’s hand;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-486" id="noteref-486" epub:type="noteref">486</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-487" id="noteref-487" epub:type="noteref">487</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So with his head I see no farther forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-488" id="noteref-488" epub:type="noteref">488</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thou put me not to further speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that I Camicion de’ Pazzi was,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-489" id="noteref-489" epub:type="noteref">489</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wait Carlino to exonerate me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I beheld a thousand faces, made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Purple with cold; whence o’er me comes a shudder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore will come, at frozen ponds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while we were advancing tow’rds the middle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where everything of weight unites together,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was shivering in the eternal shade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whether ’twere will, or destiny, or chance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I know not; but in walking ’mong the heads</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I struck my foot hard in the face of one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping he growled: “Why dost thou trample me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-490" id="noteref-490" epub:type="noteref">490</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “My Master, now wait here for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I through him may issue from a doubt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Leader stopped; and to that one I said</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was blaspheming vehemently still:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-491" id="noteref-491" epub:type="noteref">491</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiting,” replied he, “other people’s cheeks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, if thou wert living, ’twere too much?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was my response, “if thou demandest fame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ’mid the other notes thy name I place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “For the reverse I long;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “It must needs be thou name thyself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or not a hair remain upon thee here.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he to me: “Though thou strip off my hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If on my head a thousand times thou fall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had his hair in hand already twisted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more than one shock of it had pulled out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He barking, with his eyes held firmly down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When cried another: “What doth ail thee, Bocca?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-492" id="noteref-492" epub:type="noteref">492</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is’t not enough to clatter with thy jaws,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now,” said I, “I care not to have thee speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will report of thee veracious news.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Begone,” replied he, “and tell what thou wilt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But be not silent, if thou issue hence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He weepeth here the silver of the French;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘I saw,’ thus canst thou phrase it, ‘him of Duera<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-493" id="noteref-493" epub:type="noteref">493</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating,</span>

					<span class="i1">Tell me the wherefore,” said I, “with this compact,</span>

					<span class="i1">That sinner, wiping it upon the hair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the same head that he behind had wasted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he began: “Thou wilt that I renew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To think of only, ere I speak of it;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-500" id="noteref-500" epub:type="noteref">500</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That, by effect of his malicious thoughts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trusting in him I was made prisoner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after put to death, I need not say;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ne’ertheless what thou canst not have heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is to say, how cruel was my death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A narrow perforation in the mew,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-501" id="noteref-501" epub:type="noteref">501</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bears because of me the title of Famine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in which others still must be locked up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had shown me through its opening many moons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already, when I dreamed the evil dream</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of the future rent for me the veil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one appeared to me as lord and master,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-502" id="noteref-502" epub:type="noteref">502</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-503" id="noteref-503" epub:type="noteref">503</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfranchi</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had sent out before him to the front.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After brief course seemed unto me forespent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I before the morrow was awake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with me were, and asking after bread.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thinking of what my heart foreboded me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weep’st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which our food used to be brought to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And through his dream was each one apprehensive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I heard locking up the under door<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-504" id="noteref-504" epub:type="noteref">504</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I gazed into the faces of my sons.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wept not, I within so turned to stone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They wept; and darling little Anselm mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: ‘Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until another sun rose on the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As now a little glimmer made its way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the dolorous prison, and I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon four faces my own very aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of my hands in agony I bit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, thinking that I did it from desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of eating, on a sudden they uprose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said they: ‘Father, much less pain ’twill give us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I calmed me then, not to make them more sad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That day we all were silent, and the next.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Threw himself down outstretched before my feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, ‘My father, why dost thou not help me?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there he died; and, as thou seest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw the three fall one by one, between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already blind, to groping over each,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And three days called them after they were dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he had said this, with his eyes distorted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, as a dog’s, upon the bone were strong.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the fair land there where the <i xml:lang="it">Sì</i> doth sound,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-505" id="noteref-505" epub:type="noteref">505</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since slow to punish thee thy neighbors are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let the Capraia and Gorgona move,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-506" id="noteref-506" epub:type="noteref">506</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every person in thee it may drown!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if Count Ugolino had the fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of having in thy castles thee betrayed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-507" id="noteref-507" epub:type="noteref">507</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-508" id="noteref-508" epub:type="noteref">508</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the other two my song doth name above!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We passed still farther onward, where the ice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another people ruggedly enswathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not downward turned, but all of them reversed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping itself there does not let them weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns itself inward to increase the anguish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the earliest tears a cluster form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, in the manner of a crystal visor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And notwithstanding that, as in a callus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of cold all sensibility</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its station had abandoned in my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still it appeared to me I felt some wind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I: “My Master, who sets this in motion?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is not below here every vapor quenched?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he to me: “Full soon shalt thou be where</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing the cause which raineth down the blast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of the wretches of the frozen crust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out to us: “O souls so merciless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the last post is given unto you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little, e’er the weeping recongeal.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “If thou wouldst have me help thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May I go to the bottom of the ice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he replied: “I am Friar Alberigo;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-509" id="noteref-509" epub:type="noteref">509</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He am I of the fruit of the bad garden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who here a date am getting for my fig.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-510" id="noteref-510" epub:type="noteref">510</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I to him, “now art thou, too, dead?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he to me: “How may my body fare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up in the world, no knowledge I possess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-511" id="noteref-511" epub:type="noteref">511</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oftentimes the soul descendeth here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-512" id="noteref-512" epub:type="noteref">512</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, that thou mayest more willingly remove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From off my countenance these glassy tears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Know that as soon as any soul betrays</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have done, his body by a demon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until his time has wholly been revolved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Itself down rushes into such a cistern;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And still perchance above appears the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is Ser Branca d’ Oria, and many years<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-513" id="noteref-513" epub:type="noteref">513</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have passed away since he was thus locked up.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I think,” said I to him, “thou dost deceive me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For Branca d’ Oria is not dead as yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In moat above,” said he, “of Malebranche,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where is boiling the tenacious pitch,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When this one left a devil in his stead</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his own body and one near of kin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made together with him the betrayal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Open mine eyes”;⁠—and open them I did not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to be rude to him was courtesy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-514" id="noteref-514" epub:type="noteref">514</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With every virtue, full of every vice!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with the vilest spirit of Romagna<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-515" id="noteref-515" epub:type="noteref">515</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I found of you one such, who for his deeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In soul already in Cocytus bathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And still above in body seems alive!</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Some prone are lying, others stand erect,</span>

					<span>How frozen I became and powerless then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because all language would be insufficient.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not die, and I alive remained not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I became, being of both deprived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-518" id="noteref-518" epub:type="noteref">518</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And better with a giant I compare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than do the giants with those arms of his;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Consider now how great must be that whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which unto such a part conforms itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were he as fair once, as he now is foul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lifted up his brow against his Maker,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well may proceed from him all tribulation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, what a marvel it appeared to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld three faces on his head!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-519" id="noteref-519" epub:type="noteref">519</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one in front, and that vermilion was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Two were the others, that were joined with this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the middle part of either shoulder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they were joined together at the crest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the right-hand one seemed ’twixt white and yellow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The left was such to look upon as those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-520" id="noteref-520" epub:type="noteref">520</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underneath each came forth two mighty wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as befitting were so great a bird;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sails of the sea I never saw so large.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-521" id="noteref-521" epub:type="noteref">521</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>No feathers had they, but as of a bat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their fashion was; and he was waving them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-522" id="noteref-522" epub:type="noteref">522</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sinner, in the manner of a brake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he three of them tormented thus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him in front the biting was as naught</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Utterly stripped of all the skin remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That soul up there which has the greatest pain,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, “is Judas Iscariot;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-523" id="noteref-523" epub:type="noteref">523</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With head inside, he plies his legs without.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the two others, who head downward are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But night is reascending, and ’tis time<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-524" id="noteref-524" epub:type="noteref">524</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we depart, for we have seen the whole.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he the vantage seized of time and place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when the wings were opened wide apart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From fell to fell descended downward then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the thick hair and the frozen crust.</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">Exactly on the thickness of the haunch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-525" id="noteref-525" epub:type="noteref">525</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Guide, with labor and with hard-drawn breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned round his head where he had had his legs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that to Hell I thought we were returning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, panting as one fatigued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Must we perforce depart from so much evil.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then through the opening of a rock he issued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And down upon the margin seated me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then tow’rds me he outstretched his wary step.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lucifer in the same way I had left him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I beheld him upward hold his legs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I then became disquieted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let stolid people think who do not see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What the point is beyond which I had passed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Rise up,” the Master said, “upon thy feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The way is long, and difficult the road,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-526" id="noteref-526" epub:type="noteref">526</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was not any palace corridor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where we were, but dungeon natural,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With floor uneven and unease of light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ere from the abyss I tear myself away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master,” said I when I had arisen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“To draw me from an error speak a little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus upside down? and how in such short time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thou still imaginest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hair of the fell worm, who mines the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That side thou wast, so long as I descended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which things heavy draw from every side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now beneath the hemisphere art come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Opposite that which overhangs the vast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dry-land, and ’neath whose cope was put to death<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-527" id="noteref-527" epub:type="noteref">527</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Man who without sin was born and lived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes the other face of the Judecca.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here it is morn when it is evening there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who with his hair a stairway made us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still fixed remaineth as he was before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this side he fell down out of heaven;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the land, that whilom here emerged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For fear of him made of the sea a veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To flee from him, what on this side appears<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-528" id="noteref-528" epub:type="noteref">528</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A place there is below, from Beelzebub</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far receding as the tomb extends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which not by sight is known, but by the sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-529" id="noteref-529" epub:type="noteref">529</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With course that winds about and slightly falls.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Guide and I into that hidden road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now entered, to return to the bright world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And without care of having any rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounted up, he first and I the second,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I beheld through a round aperture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-530" id="noteref-530" epub:type="noteref">530</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars.</span>

					<span class="i1">When anyone it makes to thirst for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little spark is followed by great flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance with better voices after me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1204" id="noteref-1204" epub:type="noteref">1204</a></span>

					<span>To mortal men by passages diverse</span>

					<span class="i1">Uprises the world’s lamp; but by that one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which circles four uniteth with three crosses,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1205" id="noteref-1205" epub:type="noteref">1205</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Almost that passage had made morning there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evening here, and there was wholly white<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1207" id="noteref-1207" epub:type="noteref">1207</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hemisphere, and black the other part,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When Beatrice towards the left-hand side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never did eagle fasten so upon it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as a second ray is wont</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To issue from the first and reascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a pilgrim who would fain return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus of her action, through the eyes infused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In my imagination, mine I made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There much is lawful which is here unlawful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto our powers, by virtue of the place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made for the human species as its own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not long I bore it, nor so little while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I beheld it sparkle round about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like iron that comes molten from the fire;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1208" id="noteref-1208" epub:type="noteref">1208</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And suddenly it seemed that day to day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1209" id="noteref-1209" epub:type="noteref">1209</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was added, as if He who has the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had with another sun the heaven adorned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With eyes upon the everlasting wheels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fixing my vision from above removed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such at her aspect inwardly became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1210" id="noteref-1210" epub:type="noteref">1210</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Peer of the other gods beneath the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To represent transhumanize in words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impossible were; the example, then, suffice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him for whom Grace the experience reserves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I was merely what of me thou newly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1211" id="noteref-1211" epub:type="noteref">1211</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Createdst, Love who governest the heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1212" id="noteref-1212" epub:type="noteref">1212</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Desiring thee, made me attentive to it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By harmony thou dost modulate and measure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1213" id="noteref-1213" epub:type="noteref">1213</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the sun’s flame, that neither rain nor river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er made a lake so widely spread abroad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The newness of the sound and the great light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled in me a longing for their cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Never before with such acuteness felt;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To quiet in me my perturbed mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she began: “Thou makest thyself so dull</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With false imagining, that thou seest not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1214" id="noteref-1214" epub:type="noteref">1214</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If of my former doubt I was divested</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By these brief little words more smiled than spoken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I in a new one was the more ensnared;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Already did I rest content</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From great amazement; but am now amazed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In what way I transcend these bodies light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her eyes directed tow’rds me with that look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mother casts on a delirious child;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she began: “All things whate’er they be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have order among themselves, and this is form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That makes the universe resemble God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here do the higher creatures see the footprints</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Eternal Power, which is the end</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereto is made the law already mentioned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the order that I speak of are inclined<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1215" id="noteref-1215" epub:type="noteref">1215</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All natures, by their destinies diverse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More or less near unto their origin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence they move onward unto ports diverse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er the great sea of being; and each one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With instinct given it which bears it on.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This bears away the fire towards the moon;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is in mortal hearts the motive power;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This binds together and unites the earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor only the created things that are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without intelligence this bow shoots forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But those that have both intellect and love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Providence that regulates all this<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1216" id="noteref-1216" epub:type="noteref">1216</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1217" id="noteref-1217" epub:type="noteref">1217</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thither now, as to a site decreed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bears us away the virtue of that cord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, that as oftentimes the form</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accords not with the intention of the art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because in answering is matter deaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So likewise from this course doth deviate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>(In the same wise as one may see the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Earthward is wrested by some false delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At thine ascent, than at a rivulet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From some high mount descending to the lowland.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if on earth the living fire were quiet.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1218" id="noteref-1218" epub:type="noteref">1218</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereat she heavenward turned again her face.</span>

				<p>
					<span>O Ye, who in some pretty little boat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1219" id="noteref-1219" epub:type="noteref">1219</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eager to listen, have been following</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind my ship, that singing sails along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turn back to look again upon your shores;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not put out to sea, lest peradventure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In losing me, you might yourselves be lost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sea I sail has never yet been passed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1220" id="noteref-1220" epub:type="noteref">1220</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Muses nine point out to me the Bears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye other few who have the neck uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Betimes to th’ bread of Angels upon which<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1221" id="noteref-1221" epub:type="noteref">1221</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One liveth here and grows not sated by it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the water that grows smooth again.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1222" id="noteref-1222" epub:type="noteref">1222</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Jason they beheld a ploughman made!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The con-created and perpetual thirst<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1223" id="noteref-1223" epub:type="noteref">1223</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the realm deiform did bear us on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As swift almost as ye the heavens behold.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1224" id="noteref-1224" epub:type="noteref">1224</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whom no care of mine could be concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Fix gratefully thy mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On God, who unto the first star has brought us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As adamant on which the sun is striking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into itself did the eternal pearl</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Receive us, even as water doth receive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A ray of light, remaining still unbroken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If I was body, (and we here conceive not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How one dimension tolerates another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which needs must be if body enter body,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More the desire should be enkindled in us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That essence to behold, wherein is seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How God and our own nature were united.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There will be seen what we receive by faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not demonstrated, but self-evident</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In guise of the first truth that man believes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made reply: “Madonna, as devoutly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As most I can do I give thanks to Him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who has removed me from the mortal world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me what the dusky spots may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon this body, which below on earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1225" id="noteref-1225" epub:type="noteref">1225</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Somewhat she smiled; and then, “If the opinion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of mortals be erroneous,” she said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Where’er the key of sense doth not unlock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now, forasmuch as, following the senses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seest that the reason has short wings.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me what thou think’st of it thyself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I: “What seems to us up here diverse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1226" id="noteref-1226" epub:type="noteref">1226</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she: “Right truly shalt thou see immersed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In error thy belief, if well thou hearest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The argument that I shall make against it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1227" id="noteref-1227" epub:type="noteref">1227</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in their quality and quantity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May noted be of aspects different.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If this were caused by rare and dense alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One only virtue would there be in all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or more or less diffused, or equally.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of formal principles; and these, save one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Besides, if rarity were of this dimness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1228" id="noteref-1228" epub:type="noteref">1228</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause thou askest, either through and through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This planet thus attenuate were of matter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Or else, as in a body is apportioned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fat and lean, so in like manner this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would in its volume interchange the leaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Were it the former, in the sun’s eclipse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It would be manifest by the shining through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is not so; hence we must scan the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if it chance the other I demolish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then falsified will thy opinion be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if this rarity go not through and through,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There needs must be a limit, beyond which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its contrary prevents the further passing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thence the foreign radiance is reflected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a color cometh back from glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The which behind itself concealeth lead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1229" id="noteref-1229" epub:type="noteref">1229</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More dimly there than in the other parts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By being there reflected farther back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From this reply experiment will free thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er thou try it, which is wont to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fountain to the rivers of your arts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alike from thee, the other more remote</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the former two shall meet thine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And coming back to thee by all reflected.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Though in its quantity be not so ample</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The image most remote, there shalt thou see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How it perforce is equally resplendent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Naked the subject of the snow remains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1230" id="noteref-1230" epub:type="noteref">1230</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of its former color and its cold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee thus remaining in thy intellect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will I inform with such a living light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1231" id="noteref-1231" epub:type="noteref">1231</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the heaven of the divine repose<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1232" id="noteref-1232" epub:type="noteref">1232</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The being of whatever it contains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The following heaven, that has so many eyes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1233" id="noteref-1233" epub:type="noteref">1233</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Divides this being by essences diverse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Distinguished from it, and by it contained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other spheres, by various differences,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All the distinctions which they have within them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dispose unto their ends and their effects.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus do these organs of the world proceed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since from above they take, and act beneath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Observe me well, how through this place I come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The power and motion of the holy spheres,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As from the artisan the hammer’s craft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the blessed motors must proceed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the Intelligence profound, which turns it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1234" id="noteref-1234" epub:type="noteref">1234</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The image takes, and makes of it a seal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as the soul within your dust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through members different and accommodated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To faculties diverse expands itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So likewise this Intelligence diffuses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its virtue multiplied among the stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Itself revolving on its unity.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make with the precious body that it quickens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which, as life in you, it is combined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the glad nature whence it is derived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mingled virtue through the body shines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as gladness through the living pupil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From this proceeds whate’er from light to light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeareth different, not from dense and rare:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is the formal principle that produces,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1235" id="noteref-1235" epub:type="noteref">1235</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>According to its goodness, dark and bright.”</span>

					<span>That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1236" id="noteref-1236" epub:type="noteref">1236</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, that I might confess myself convinced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And confident, so far as was befitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I lifted more erect my head to speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So close to it, in order to be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That my confession I remembered not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as through polished and transparent glass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or waters crystalline and undisturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so deep as that their bed be lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come back again the outlines of our faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes not less speedily unto our eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such saw I many faces prompt to speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I ran in error opposite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To that which kindled love ’twixt man and fountain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1237" id="noteref-1237" epub:type="noteref">1237</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I became aware of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Esteeming them as mirrored semblances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct into the light of my sweet Guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marvel thou not,” she said to me, “because</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I smile at this thy puerile conceit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But turns thee, as ’tis wont, on emptiness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">True substances are these which thou beholdest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here relegate for breaking of some vow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore speak with them, listen and believe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the true light, which giveth peace to them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Permits them not to turn from it their feet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak directed me, and I began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one whom too great eagerness bewilders:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O well-created spirit, who in the rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which being untasted ne’er is comprehended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grateful ’twill be to me, if thou content me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both with thy name and with your destiny.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1238" id="noteref-1238" epub:type="noteref">1238</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Our charity doth never shut the doors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against a just desire, except as one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1239" id="noteref-1239" epub:type="noteref">1239</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who wills that all her court be like herself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was a virgin sister in the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thy mind doth contemplate me well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The being more fair will not conceal me from thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, stationed here among these other blessed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All our affections, that alone inflamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rejoice at being of his order formed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this allotment, which appears so low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore is given us, because our vows</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have been neglected and in some part void.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to her: “In your miraculous aspects</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There shines I know not what of the divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doth transform you from our first conceptions.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But what thou tellest me now aids me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the refiguring is easier to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, ye who in this place are happy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are you desirous of a higher place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see more or to make yourselves more friends?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First with those other shades she smiled a little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter answered me so full of gladness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She seemed to burn in the first fire of love:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Brother, our will is quieted by virtue<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1240" id="noteref-1240" epub:type="noteref">1240</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of charity, that makes us wish alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If to be more exalted we aspired,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discordant would our aspirations be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the will of Him who here secludes us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If being in charity is needful here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if thou lookest well into its nature;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nay, ’tis essential to this blest existence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keep itself within the will divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby our very wishes are made one;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that, as we are station above station</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout this realm, to all the realm ’tis pleasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to the King, who makes his will our will.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And his will is our peace; this is the sea</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which is moving onward whatsoever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It doth create, and all that nature makes.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it was clear to me how everywhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In heaven is Paradise, although the grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of good supreme there rain not in one measure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as it comes to pass, if one food sates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for another still remains the longing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We ask for this, and that decline with thanks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en thus did I; with gesture and with word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To learn from her what was the web wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She did not ply the shuttle to the end.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A perfect life and merit high in-heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lady o’er us,” said she, “by whose rule</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down in your world they vest and veil themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That until death they may both watch and sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which charity conformeth to his pleasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To follow her, in girlhood from the world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fled, and in her habit shut myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pledged me to the pathway of her sect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then men accustomed unto evil more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">God knows what afterward my life became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This other splendor, which to thee reveals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Itself on my right side, and is enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the illumination of our sphere,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What of myself I say applies to her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A nun was she, and likewise from her head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was ta’en the shadow of the sacred wimple.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when she too was to the world returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against her wishes and against good usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the heart’s veil she never was divested.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of great Costanza this is the effulgence,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1241" id="noteref-1241" epub:type="noteref">1241</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who from the second wind of Suabia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Brought forth the third and latest puissance.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me she spake, and then began</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Ave Maria” singing, and in singing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vanished, as through deep water something heavy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My sight, that followed her as long a time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it was possible, when it had lost her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round unto the mark of more desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wholly unto Beatrice reverted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That at the first my sight endured it not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this in questioning more backward made me.</span>

					<span>Between two viands, equally removed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1242" id="noteref-1242" epub:type="noteref">1242</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And tempting, a free man would die of hunger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1243" id="noteref-1243" epub:type="noteref">1243</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere either he could bring unto his teeth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So would a lamb between the ravenings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so would stand a dog between two does.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1244" id="noteref-1244" epub:type="noteref">1244</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impelled in equal measure by my doubts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since it must be so, nor do I commend.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1245" id="noteref-1245" epub:type="noteref">1245</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I held my peace; but my desire was painted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon my face, and questioning with that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More fervent far than by articulate speech.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beatrice did as Daniel had done<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1246" id="noteref-1246" epub:type="noteref">1246</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which rendered him unjustly merciless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “Well see I how attracteth thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One and the other wish, so that thy care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou arguest, if good will be permanent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The violence of others, for what reason</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth it decrease the measure of my merit?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again for doubting furnish thee occasion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Souls seeming to return unto the stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to the sentiment of Plato.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1247" id="noteref-1247" epub:type="noteref">1247</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These are the questions which upon thy wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are thrusting equally; and therefore first<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1248" id="noteref-1248" epub:type="noteref">1248</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will I treat that which hath the most of gall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1249" id="noteref-1249" epub:type="noteref">1249</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Have not in any other heaven their seats,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor of existence more or fewer years;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all make beautiful the primal circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And have sweet life in different degrees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By feeling more or less the eternal breath.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They showed themselves here, not because allotted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This sphere has been to them, but to give sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the celestial which is least exalted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To speak thus is adapted to your mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since only through the sense it apprehendeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What then it worthy makes of intellect.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1250" id="noteref-1250" epub:type="noteref">1250</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>On this account the Scripture condescends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto your faculties, and feet and hands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To God attributes, and means something else;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Holy Church under an aspect human</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gabriel and Michael represent to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him who made Tobias whole again.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1251" id="noteref-1251" epub:type="noteref">1251</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which Timaeus argues of the soul<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1252" id="noteref-1252" epub:type="noteref">1252</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth not resemble that which here is seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1253" id="noteref-1253" epub:type="noteref">1253</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He says the soul unto its star returns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Believing it to have been severed thence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whenever nature gave it as a form.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1254" id="noteref-1254" epub:type="noteref">1254</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the words sound, and possibly may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With meaning that is not to be derided.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he doth mean that to these wheels return</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The honor of their influence and the blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This principle ill understood once warped</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The whole world nearly, till it went astray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1255" id="noteref-1255" epub:type="noteref">1255</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other doubt which doth disquiet thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1256" id="noteref-1256" epub:type="noteref">1256</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Less venom has, for its malevolence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could never lead thee otherwhere from me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That as unjust our justice should appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In eyes of mortals, is an argument</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of faith, and not of sin heretical.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still, that your perception may be able</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thoroughly penetrate this verity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If it be violence when he who suffers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cooperates not with him who uses force,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These souls were not on that account excused;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For will is never quenched unless it will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But operates as nature doth in fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If violence a thousand times distort it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The force; and these have done so, having power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of turning back unto the holy place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If their will had been perfect, like to that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1257" id="noteref-1257" epub:type="noteref">1257</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Mutius made severe to his own hand,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1258" id="noteref-1258" epub:type="noteref">1258</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It would have urged them back along the road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But such a solid will is all too rare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by these words, if thou hast gathered them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That would have still annoyed thee many times.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now another passage runs across</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I have for certain put into thy mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That soul beatified could never lie,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is near the primal Truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then thou from Piccarda might’st have heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Costanza kept affection for the veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that she seemeth here to contradict me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Many times, brother, has it come to pass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, to escape from peril, with reluctance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has been done it was not right to do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1259" id="noteref-1259" epub:type="noteref">1259</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereto entreated, his own mother slew)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not to lose pity pitiless became.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this point I desire thee to remember</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That force with will commingles, and they cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the offences cannot be excused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Will absolute consenteth not to evil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in so far consenteth as it fears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it refrain, to fall into more harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence when Piccarda uses this expression,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She meaneth the will absolute, and I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The other, so that both of us speak truth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was the flowing of the holy river</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That issued from the fount whence springs all truth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This put to rest my wishes one and all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O love of the first lover, O divine,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1260" id="noteref-1260" epub:type="noteref">1260</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said I forthwith, “whose speech inundates me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And warms me so, it more and more revives me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My own affection is not so profound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to suffice in rendering grace for grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceive that never sated is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our intellect unless the Truth illume it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond which nothing true expands itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it attains it; and it can attain it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If not, then each desire would frustrate be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1261" id="noteref-1261" epub:type="noteref">1261</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to the top from height to height impels us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This doth invite me, this assurance give me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another truth, which is obscure to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wish to know if man can satisfy you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For broken vows with other good deeds, so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in your balance they will not be light.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1262" id="noteref-1262" epub:type="noteref">1262</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of the sparks of love, and so divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, overcome my power, I turned my back</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And almost lost myself with eyes downcast.</span>

					<span>“If in the heat of love I flame upon thee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1263" id="noteref-1263" epub:type="noteref">1263</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the measure that on earth is seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the valor of thine eyes I vanquish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From perfect sight, which as it apprehends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the good apprehended moves its feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well I perceive how is already shining</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into thine intellect the eternal light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That only seen enkindles always love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if some other thing your love seduce,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1264" id="noteref-1264" epub:type="noteref">1264</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis nothing but a vestige of the same,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ill understood, which there is shining through.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou fain wouldst know if with another service</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For broken vow can such return be made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to secure the soul from further claim.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This Canto thus did Beatrice begin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as a man who breaks not off his speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Continued thus her holy argument:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The greatest gift that in his largess God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Creating made, and unto his own goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Most highly, is the freedom of the will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith the creatures of intelligence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both all and only were and are endowed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1265" id="noteref-1265" epub:type="noteref">1265</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The high worth of a vow, if it he made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that when thou consentest God consents:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For, closing between God and man the compact,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sacrifice is of this treasure made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as I say, and made by its own act.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What can be rendered then as compensation?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think’st thou to make good use of what thou’st offered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1266" id="noteref-1266" epub:type="noteref">1266</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now art thou certain of the greater point;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But because Holy Church in this dispenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the solid food which thou hast taken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Requireth further aid for thy digestion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open thy mind to that which I reveal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fix it there within; for ’tis not knowledge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The having heard without retaining it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the essence of this sacrifice two things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Convene together; and the one is that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which ’tis made, the other is the agreement.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This last for evermore is cancelled not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless complied with, and concerning this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such precision has above been spoken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To offer still, though sometimes what was offered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might be commuted, as thou ought’st to know.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other, which is known to thee as matter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1267" id="noteref-1267" epub:type="noteref">1267</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May well indeed be such that one errs not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it for other matter be exchanged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let none shift the burden on his shoulder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At his arbitrament, without the turning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of the white and of the yellow key;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1268" id="noteref-1268" epub:type="noteref">1268</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And every permutation deem as foolish,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If in the substitute the thing relinquished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the four is in six, be not contained.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1269" id="noteref-1269" epub:type="noteref">1269</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore whatever thing has so great weight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In value that it drags down every balance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cannot be satisfied with other spending.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let mortals never take a vow in jest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be faithful and not blind in doing that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Jephthah was in his first offering,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1270" id="noteref-1270" epub:type="noteref">1270</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whom more beseemed to say, ‘I have done wrong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1271" id="noteref-1271" epub:type="noteref">1271</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1272" id="noteref-1272" epub:type="noteref">1272</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made for her both wise and simple weep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Christians, be ye more serious in your movements;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be ye not like a feather at each wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And think not every water washes you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye have the Old and the New Testament,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let this suffice you unto your salvation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If evil appetite cry aught else to you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1273" id="noteref-1273" epub:type="noteref">1273</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the Jew among you may not mock you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1274" id="noteref-1274" epub:type="noteref">1274</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its mother’s milk, and frolicsome and simple</span>

					<span class="i1">Combats at its own pleasure with itself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then all desireful turned herself again</span>

					<span class="i1">To that part where the world is most alive.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1275" id="noteref-1275" epub:type="noteref">1275</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her silence and her change of countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silence imposed upon my eager mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had already in advance new questions;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as an arrow that upon the mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did we speed into the second realm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady there so joyful I beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As into the brightness of that heaven she entered,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1276" id="noteref-1276" epub:type="noteref">1276</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More luminous thereat the planet grew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the star itself was changed and smiled,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1277" id="noteref-1277" epub:type="noteref">1277</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What became I, who by my nature am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exceeding mutable in every guise!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As, in a fishpond which is pure and tranquil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fishes draw to that which from without</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I beheld more than a thousand splendors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawing towards us, and in each was heard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as each one was coming unto us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Full of beatitude the shade was seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the effulgence clear that issued from it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1278" id="noteref-1278" epub:type="noteref">1278</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think, Reader, if what here is just beginning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An agonizing need of knowing more;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of thyself thou’lt see how I from these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was in desire of hearing their conditions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they unto mine eyes were manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou wellborn, unto whom Grace concedes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the thrones of the eternal triumph,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With light that through the whole of heaven is spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus by someone among those holy spirits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1279" id="noteref-1279" epub:type="noteref">1279</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was spoken, and by Beatrice: “Speak, speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Securely, and believe them even as Gods.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they coruscate when thou dost smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit august, thy station in the sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That veils itself to men in alien rays.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1280" id="noteref-1280" epub:type="noteref">1280</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This said I in direction of the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which first had spoken to me; whence it became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By far more lucent than it was before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1281" id="noteref-1281" epub:type="noteref">1281</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By too much light, when heat has worn away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tempering influence of the vapors dense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By greater rapture thus concealed itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its own radiance the figure saintly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thus close, close enfolded answered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In fashion as the following Canto sings.</span>

					<span class="i1">To bring the whole world to its mood serene,</span>

					<span class="i1">Lay sick for many centuries in great error,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till to descend it pleased the Word of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where the nature, which from its own Maker</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Estranged itself, he joined to him in person</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By the sole act of his eternal love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now unto what is said direct thy sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This nature when united to its Maker,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as created, was sincere and good;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1329" id="noteref-1329" epub:type="noteref">1329</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by itself alone was banished forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Paradise, because it turned aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the way of truth and of its life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the penalty the cross held out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If measured by the nature thus assumed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">None ever yet with so great justice stung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And none was ever of so great injustice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Considering who the Person was that suffered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within whom such a nature was contracted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From one act therefore issued things diverse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It should no longer now seem difficult</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a just court was afterward avenged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now do I behold thy mind entangled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thought to thought within a knot, from which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With great desire it waits to free itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou sayest, ‘Well discern I what I hear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But it is hidden from me why God willed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For our redemption only this one mode.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Buried remaineth, brother, this decree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the eyes of everyone whose nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is in the flame of love not yet adult.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Verily, inasmuch as at this mark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One gazes long and little is discerned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All envy, burning in itself so sparkles<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1330" id="noteref-1330" epub:type="noteref">1330</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the eternal beauties it unfolds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whate’er from this immediately distils<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1331" id="noteref-1331" epub:type="noteref">1331</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has afterwards no end, for ne’er removed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is its impression when it sets its seal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whate’er from this immediately rains down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is wholly free, because it is not subject</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the influences of novel things.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the blest ardor that irradiates all things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that most like itself is most vivacious.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With all of these things has advantaged been<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1332" id="noteref-1332" epub:type="noteref">1332</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human creature; and if one be wanting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From his nobility he needs must fall.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And render him unlike the Good Supreme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he little with its light is blanched,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to his dignity no more returns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless he fill up where transgression empties</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With righteous pains for criminal delights.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your nature when it sinned so utterly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its own seed, out of these dignities</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as out of Paradise was driven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor could itself recover, if thou notest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With nicest subtlety, by anyway,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Except by passing one of these two fords:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Either that God through clemency alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had pardon granted, or that man himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had satisfaction for his folly made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal counsel, to my speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as may be fastened steadfastly!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Man in his limitations had not power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To satisfy, not having power to sink</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his humility obeying then,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far as he disobeying thought to rise;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for this reason man has been from power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of satisfying by himself excluded.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it God behoved in his own ways</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Man to restore unto his perfect life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say in one, or else in both of them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since the action of the doer is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much more grateful, as it more presents</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The goodness of the heart from which it issues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Goodness Divine, that doth imprint the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has been contented to proceed by each</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all its ways to lift you up again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor ’twixt the first day and the final night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such high and such magnificent proceeding</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By one or by the other was or shall be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For God more bounteous was himself to give</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make man able to uplift himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than if he only of himself had pardoned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the other modes were insufficient</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For justice, were it not the Son of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself had humbled to become incarnate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, to fill fully each desire of thine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Return I to elucidate one place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In order that thou there mayst see as I do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou sayst: ‘I see the air, I see the fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come to corruption, and short while endure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And these things notwithstanding were created’;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore if that which I have said were true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They should have been secure against corruption.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Angels, brother, and the land sincere<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1333" id="noteref-1333" epub:type="noteref">1333</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which thou art, created may be called</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just as they are in their entire existence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But all the elements which thou hast named,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all those things which out of them are made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a created virtue are informed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Created was the matter which they have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created was the informing influence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within these stars that round about them go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The soul of every brute and of the plants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By its potential temperament attracts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ray and motion of the holy lights;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But your own life immediately inspires<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1334" id="noteref-1334" epub:type="noteref">1334</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So with herself, it evermore desires her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou from this mayst argue furthermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your resurrection, if thou think again</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How human flesh was fashioned at that time</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the first parents both of them were made.”</span>

					<span class="i1">They would not laggard and impeded seem</span>

					<span>And behind those that most in front appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sounded “Osanna!” so that never since</span>

					<span class="i1">To hear again was I without desire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then unto us more nearly one approached,</span>

					<span class="i1">Unto thy pleasure, that thou joy in us.</span>

					<span>We turn around with the celestial Princes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1345" id="noteref-1345" epub:type="noteref">1345</a></span>

					<span class="i1">One gyre and one gyration and one thirst,</span>

					<span>After these eyes of mine themselves had offered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1347" id="noteref-1347" epub:type="noteref">1347</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Lady reverently, and she</span>

					<span class="i1">Made of itself, and “Say, who art thou?” was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My voice, imprinted with a great affection.</span>

					<span class="i1">With the new joy that superadded was</span>

					<span>Thus changed, it said to me: “The world possessed me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1349" id="noteref-1349" epub:type="noteref">1349</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>This I to him; and he to me: “If I</span>

					<span class="i1">Would in such manner its effects produce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That they no longer would be arts, but ruins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cannot be, if the Intelligences</span>

					<span class="i1">That keep these stars in motion are not maimed,</span>

					<span>Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?”</span>

					<span class="i1">That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he again: “Now say, would it be worse</span>

					<span class="i1">Directing upon vanity your foreheads!</span>

					<span class="i1">Approached me, and its will to pleasure me</span>

					<span class="i1">It signified by brightening outwardly.</span>

					<span class="i1">Out of its depths, whence it before was singing,</span>

					<span class="i1">Of Italy, that lies between Rialto</span>

					<span class="i1">For altitude so great, it is no marvel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since o’er the sun was never eye could go.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1425" id="noteref-1425" epub:type="noteref">1425</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such in this place was the fourth family</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high Father, who forever sates it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Showing how he breathes forth and how begets.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1426" id="noteref-1426" epub:type="noteref">1426</a></span>

					<span>And Beatrice began: “Give thanks, give thanks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never was heart of mortal so disposed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To worship, nor to give itself to God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all its gratitude was it so ready,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As at those words did I myself become;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all my love was so absorbed in Him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the splendor of her laughing eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My single mind on many things divided.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make us a centre and themselves a circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus girt about the daughter of Latona<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1427" id="noteref-1427" epub:type="noteref">1427</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it holds the thread which makes her zone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the court of Heaven, whence I return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are many jewels found, so fair and precious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They cannot be transported from the realm;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of them was the singing of those lights.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tidings thence may from the dumb await!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as singing thus those burning suns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had round about us whirled themselves three times,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like unto stars neighboring the steadfast poles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But who stop short, in silence listening</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till they have gathered the new melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And within one I heard beginning: “When<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1428" id="noteref-1428" epub:type="noteref">1428</a></span>

					<span class="i1">True love, and which thereafter grows by loving,</span>

					<span>Within thee multiplied is so resplendent</span>

					<span class="i1">This garland that encircles with delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the lambs was I of the holy flock</span>

					<span class="i1">Remains immutable, and hence beneath</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were the heaven in its supremest virtue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The brilliance of the seal would all appear;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But nature gives it evermore deficient,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the like manner working as the artist,</span>

					<span class="i1">Who affirms without distinction, or denies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well in one as in the other case;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because it happens that full often bends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Current opinion in the false direction,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore,</span>

					<span class="i1">What I am saying, at the moment when</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Because of the resemblance that was born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his discourse and that of Beatrice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This man has need (and does not tell you so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of going to the root of one truth more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Declare unto him if the light wherewith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blossoms your substance shall remain with you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternally the same that it is now;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if it do remain, say in what manner,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After ye are again made visible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It can be that it injure not your sight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by a greater gladness urged and drawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They who are dancing in a ring sometimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplift their voices and their motions quicken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, at that orison devout and prompt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The holy circles a new joy displayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In their revolving and their wondrous song.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whoso lamenteth him that here we die</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we may live above, has never there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain.</span>

					<span class="i1">And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Three several times was chanted by each one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among those spirits, with such melody</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That for all merit it were just reward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in the lustre most divine of all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1558" id="noteref-1558" epub:type="noteref">1558</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as perhaps the Angel’s was to Mary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Answer: “As long as the festivity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Paradise shall be, so long our love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall radiate round about us such a vesture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its brightness is proportioned to the ardor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ardor to the vision; and the vision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Equals what grace it has above its worth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is reassumed, then shall our persons be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More pleasing by their being all complete;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For will increase whate’er bestows on us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light which enables us to look on Him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the vision must perforce increase,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Increase the ardor which from that is kindled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Increase the radiance which from this proceeds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But even as a coal that sends forth flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that its own appearance it maintains,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall be o’erpowered in aspect by the flesh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which still today the earth doth cover up;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor can so great a splendor weary us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For strong will be the organs of the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To everything which hath the power to please us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So sudden and alert appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both one and the other choir to say Amen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That well they showed desire for their dead bodies;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The fathers, and the rest who had been dear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever they became eternal flames.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! all round about of equal brightness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arose a lustre over what was there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like an horizon that is clearing up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as at rise of early eve begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the welkin new appearances,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sight seems real and unreal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed to me that new subsistences<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1559" id="noteref-1559" epub:type="noteref">1559</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began there to be seen, and make a circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outside the other two circumferences.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How sudden and incandescent it became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared to me, that with the other sights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That followed not my memory I must leave her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power, and I beheld myself translated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To higher salvation with my Lady only.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well was I ware that I was more uplifted</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is the same in all, such holocaust</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And not yet from my bosom was exhausted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ardor of sacrifice, before I knew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This offering was accepted and auspicious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For with so great a lustre and so red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Splendors appeared to me in twofold rays,</span>

					<span>Thus constellated in the depths of Mars,</span>

					<span class="i1">Those rays described the venerable sign<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1565" id="noteref-1565" epub:type="noteref">1565</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That quadrants joining in a circle make.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here doth my memory overcome my genius;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1566" id="noteref-1566" epub:type="noteref">1566</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I cannot find ensample worthy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But he who takes his cross and follows Christ</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again will pardon me what I omit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing in that aurora lighten Christ.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From horn to horn, and ’twixt the top and base,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1567" id="noteref-1567" epub:type="noteref">1567</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they together met and passed each other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus level and aslant and swift and slow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1568" id="noteref-1568" epub:type="noteref">1568</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We here behold, renewing still the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The particles of bodies long and short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People with cunning and with art contrive.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a lute and harp, accordant strung</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him by whom the notes are not distinguished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from the lights that there to me appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upgathered through the cross a melody,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well was I ware it was of lofty laud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because there came to me, “Arise and conquer!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1569" id="noteref-1569" epub:type="noteref">1569</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As unto him who hears and comprehends not.</span>

					<span>So much enamoured I became therewith,</span>

					<span class="i1">That until then there was not anything</span>

					<span class="i1">To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly:</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternally despoils him of that love!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As through the pure and tranquil evening air</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There shoots from time to time a sudden fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving the eyes that steadfast were before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And seems to be a star that changeth place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Except that in the part where it is kindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing is missed, and this endureth little;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from the horn that to the right extends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that cross’s foot there ran a star</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the constellation shining there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1574" id="noteref-1574" epub:type="noteref">1574</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But down the radiant fillet ran along,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that fire seemed it behind alabaster.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1575" id="noteref-1575" epub:type="noteref">1575</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus piteous did Anchises’ shade reach forward,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1576" id="noteref-1576" epub:type="noteref">1576</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any faith our greatest Muse deserve,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When in Elysium he his son perceived.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">O sanguis meus, O superinfusa</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1577" id="noteref-1577" epub:type="noteref">1577</a></span>

					</span>

					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?</i>”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then round unto my Lady turned my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on this side and that was stupefied;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For in her eyes was burning such a smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with mine own methought I touched the bottom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of my grace and of my Paradise!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The spirit joined to its beginning things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I understood not, so profound it spake;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor did it hide itself from me by choice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by necessity; for its conception</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the mark of mortals set itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the bow of burning sympathy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was so far slackened, that its speech descended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the mark of our intelligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first thing that was understood by me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was “Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it continued: “Hunger long and grateful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1578" id="noteref-1578" epub:type="noteref">1578</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1579" id="noteref-1579" epub:type="noteref">1579</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein is never changed the white nor dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which I speak to thee, by grace of her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Him who is the first, as from the unit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1580" id="noteref-1580" epub:type="noteref">1580</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If that be known, ray out the five and six;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore who I am thou askest not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why I seem more joyous unto thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than any other of this gladsome crowd.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou think’st the truth; because the small and great<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1581" id="noteref-1581" epub:type="noteref">1581</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this existence look into the mirror</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein, before thou think’st, thy thought thou showest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that the sacred love, in which I watch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which my answer is decreed already.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before I spake, and smiled to me a sign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made the wings of my desire increase;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in this wise began I: “Love and knowledge,</span>

					<span>“O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such a beginning he in answer made me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said to me: “That one from whom is named<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1586" id="noteref-1586" epub:type="noteref">1586</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first failing writ of Guenever.</span>

					<span class="i1">By Beatrice and by the holy light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That first on my account had changed its place.</span>

					<span class="i1">Imprinted well with the internal stamp;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee,</span>

					<span class="i1">That unto me had spoken before; and even</span>

					<span class="i1">Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain</span>

					<span class="i1">The Lamb of God who taketh sins away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But with clear words and unambiguous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Language responded that paternal love,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1667" id="noteref-1667" epub:type="noteref">1667</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me the time that is preparing for thee.</span>

					<span>As forth from Athens went Hippolytus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1670" id="noteref-1670" epub:type="noteref">1670</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of his step-dame false and cruel,</span>

					<span>Already this is willed, and this is sought for;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where every day the Christ is bought and sold.</span>

					<span>The blame shall follow the offended party<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1672" id="noteref-1672" epub:type="noteref">1672</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1673" id="noteref-1673" epub:type="noteref">1673</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt abandon everything beloved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most tenderly, and this the arrow is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1674" id="noteref-1674" epub:type="noteref">1674</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bread of others, and how hard a road</span>

					<span class="i1">The going down and up another’s stairs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will be the bad and foolish company<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1675" id="noteref-1675" epub:type="noteref">1675</a></span>

					<span class="i1">With which into this valley thou shalt fall;</span>

					<span>For all ingrate, all mad and impious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will they become against thee; but soon after</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Of their bestiality their own proceedings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall furnish proof; so ’twill be well for thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A party to have made thee by thyself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall be the mighty Lombard’s courtesy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1677" id="noteref-1677" epub:type="noteref">1677</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who such benign regard shall have for thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ’twixt you twain, in doing and in asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That shall be first which is with others last.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With him shalt thou see one who at his birth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1678" id="noteref-1678" epub:type="noteref">1678</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has by this star of strength been so impressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That notable shall his achievements be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not yet the people are aware of him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through his young age, since only nine years yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around about him have these wheels revolved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1679" id="noteref-1679" epub:type="noteref">1679</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In caring not for silver nor for toil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So recognized shall his magnificence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Become hereafter, that his enemies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On him rely, and on his benefits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By him shall many people be transformed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Changing condition rich and mendicant;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him, but shalt not say it”⁠—and things said he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Incredible to those who shall be present.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then added: “Son, these are the commentaries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1680" id="noteref-1680" epub:type="noteref">1680</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On what was said to thee; behold the snares</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That are concealed behind few revolutions;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet would I not thy neighbors thou shouldst envy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because thy life into the future reaches</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When by its silence showed that sainted soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it had finished putting in the woof</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into that web which I had given it warped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began I, even as he who yearneth after,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being in doubt, some counsel from a person</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The time towards me such a blow to deal me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As heaviest is to him who most gives way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if the dearest place be taken from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I may not lose the others by my songs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Down through the world of infinite bitterness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And o’er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eyes of my own Lady lifted me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And afterward through heaven from light to light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I have learned that which, if I tell again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will be a savor of strong herbs to many.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I am a timid friend to truth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fear lest I may lose my life with those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who will hereafter call this time the olden.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The light in which was smiling my own treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there I had discovered, flashed at first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then made reply: “A conscience overcast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or with its own or with another’s shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But ne’ertheless, all falsehood laid aside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make manifest thy vision utterly,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1681" id="noteref-1681" epub:type="noteref">1681</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And let them scratch wherever is the itch;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1682" id="noteref-1682" epub:type="noteref">1682</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if thine utterance shall offensive be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the first taste, a vital nutriment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which smiteth most the most exalted summits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that is no slight argument of honor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only the souls that unto fame are known;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the spirit of the hearer rests not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor doth confirm its faith by an example</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has the root of it unknown and hidden,</span>
					<br/>

					<span>Now was alone rejoicing in its word<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1683" id="noteref-1683" epub:type="noteref">1683</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That soul beatified, and I was tasting<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1684" id="noteref-1684" epub:type="noteref">1684</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Lady who to God was leading me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Change thy thought; consider that I am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the loving accents of my comfort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I turned me round, and then what love I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within those holy eyes I here relinquish;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1685" id="noteref-1685" epub:type="noteref">1685</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only that my language I distrust,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that my mind cannot return so far<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1686" id="noteref-1686" epub:type="noteref">1686</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above itself, unless another guide it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus much upon that point can I repeat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, her again beholding, my affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From every other longing was released.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While the eternal pleasure, which direct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contented me with its reflected aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conquering me with the radiance of a smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She said to me, “Turn thee about and listen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as sometimes here do we behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The affection in the look, if it be such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the soul is wrapt away by it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which I turned, I recognized therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it began: “In this fifth resting-place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the tree that liveth by its summit,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1687" id="noteref-1687" epub:type="noteref">1687</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They came to Heaven, were of such great renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every Muse therewith would affluent be.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore look thou upon the cross’s horns;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He whom I now shall name will there enact</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw athwart the Cross a splendor drawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1688" id="noteref-1688" epub:type="noteref">1688</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor noted I the word before the deed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the name of the great Maccabee<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1689" id="noteref-1689" epub:type="noteref">1689</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw another move itself revolving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gladness was the whip unto that top.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1690" id="noteref-1690" epub:type="noteref">1690</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1691" id="noteref-1691" epub:type="noteref">1691</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two of them my regard attentive followed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As followeth the eye its falcon flying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>William thereafterward, and Renouard,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1692" id="noteref-1692" epub:type="noteref">1692</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1693" id="noteref-1693" epub:type="noteref">1693</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1694" id="noteref-1694" epub:type="noteref">1694</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, moved and mingled with the other lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The soul that had addressed me showed how great</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An artist ’twas among the heavenly singers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To my right side I turned myself around,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My duty to behold in Beatrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Either by words or gesture signified;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so translucent I beheld her eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So full of pleasure, that her countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surpassed its other and its latest wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, by feeling greater delectation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man in doing good from day to day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Becomes aware his virtue is increasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I became aware that my gyration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With heaven together had increased its arc,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That miracle beholding more adorned.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1695" id="noteref-1695" epub:type="noteref">1695</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as is the change, in little lapse</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of time, in a pale woman, when her face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is from the load of bashfulness unladen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1696" id="noteref-1696" epub:type="noteref">1696</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sixth, which to itself had gathered me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within that Jovial torch did I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sparkling of the love which was therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delineate our language to mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as birds uprisen from the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in congratulation o’er their food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1697" id="noteref-1697" epub:type="noteref">1697</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from within those lights the holy creatures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made of themselves now <b>d</b>, now <b>i</b>, now <b>l</b>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1698" id="noteref-1698" epub:type="noteref">1698</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>First singing they to their own music moved;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then one becoming of these characters,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little while they rested and were silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O divine Pegasea, thou who genius<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1699" id="noteref-1699" epub:type="noteref">1699</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Illume me with thyself, that I may bring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their figures out as I have them conceived!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apparent be thy power in these brief verses!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Themselves then they displayed in five times seven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vowels and consonants; and I observed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The parts as they seemed spoken unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span><i xml:lang="la">Diligite justitiam</i>, these were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First verb and noun of all that was depicted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Qui judicatis terram</i> were the last.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1700" id="noteref-1700" epub:type="noteref">1700</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter in the <b>m</b> of the fifth word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And other lights I saw descend where was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The summit of the <b>m</b>, and pause there singing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The good, I think, that draws them to itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, as in striking upon burning logs<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1701" id="noteref-1701" epub:type="noteref">1701</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward there fly innumerable sparks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence fools are wont to look for auguries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1702" id="noteref-1702" epub:type="noteref">1702</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to ascend, some more, and others less,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, each one being quiet in its place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The head and neck beheld I of an eagle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1703" id="noteref-1703" epub:type="noteref">1703</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Delineated by that inlaid fire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who there paints has none to be his guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That virtue which is form unto the nest.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1704" id="noteref-1704" epub:type="noteref">1704</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other beatitude, that contented seemed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1705" id="noteref-1705" epub:type="noteref">1705</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At first to bloom a lily on the <b>m</b>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a slight motion followed out the imprint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O gentle star! what and how many gems</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that a second time it now be wroth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With buying and with selling in the temple</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1706" id="noteref-1706" epub:type="noteref">1706</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Implore for those who are upon the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All gone astray after the bad example!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1707" id="noteref-1707" epub:type="noteref">1707</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Once ’twas the custom to make war with swords;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now ’tis made by taking here and there<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1708" id="noteref-1708" epub:type="noteref">1708</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bread the pitying Father shuts from none.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1709" id="noteref-1709" epub:type="noteref">1709</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well canst thou say: “So steadfast my desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is unto him who willed to live alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And for a dance was led to martyrdom,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1710" id="noteref-1710" epub:type="noteref">1710</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful image that in sweet fruition</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made jubilant the interwoven souls;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeared a little ruby each, wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That each into mine eyes refracted it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what it now behoves me to retrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor voice has e’er reported, nor ink written,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor was by fantasy e’er comprehended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And utter with its voice both <em>I</em> and <em>My</em>,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When in conception it was <em>We</em> and <em>Our</em>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1712" id="noteref-1712" epub:type="noteref">1712</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it began: “Being just and merciful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Am I exalted here unto that glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which cannot be exceeded by desire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And upon earth I left my memory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such, that the evil-minded people there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Commend it, but continue not the story.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So doth a single heat from many embers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make itself felt, even as from many loves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued a single sound from out that image.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I thereafter: “O perpetual flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal joy, that only one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make me perceive your odors manifold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exhaling, break within me the great fast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which a long season has in hunger held me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not finding for it any food on earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1713" id="noteref-1713" epub:type="noteref">1713</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is in me so very old a fast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Showing desire, and making himself fine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw I become that standard, which of lauds<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1715" id="noteref-1715" epub:type="noteref">1715</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was interwoven of the grace divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such songs as he knows who there rejoices.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it began: “He who a compass turned<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1716" id="noteref-1716" epub:type="noteref">1716</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On the world’s outer verge, and who within it</span>

					<span class="i1">Devised so much occult and manifest,</span>

					<span class="i1">Should not remain in infinite excess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this makes certain that the first proud being,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was the paragon of every creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By not awaiting light fell immature.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1718" id="noteref-1718" epub:type="noteref">1718</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hence appears it, that each minor nature<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1719" id="noteref-1719" epub:type="noteref">1719</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is scant receptacle unto that good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has no end, and by itself is measured.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In consequence our vision, which perforce</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must be some ray of that intelligence</span>

					<span class="i1">With which all things whatever are replete,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1720" id="noteref-1720" epub:type="noteref">1720</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it shall not its origin discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far beyond that which is apparent to it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore into the justice sempiternal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power of vision that your world receives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As eye into the ocean, penetrates;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which, though it see the bottom near the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no light but comes from the serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never is o’ercast, nay, it is darkness<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1722" id="noteref-1722" epub:type="noteref">1722</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Amply to thee is opened now the cavern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which has concealed from thee the living justice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which thou mad’st such frequent questioning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For saidst thou: ‘Born a man is on the shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Indus, and is none who there can speak</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all his inclinations and his actions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are good, so far as human reason sees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a sin in life or in discourse:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He dieth unbaptised and without faith;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is this justice that condemneth him?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where is his fault, if he do not believe?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In judgment at a thousand miles away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the short vision of a single span?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly to him who with me subtilizes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If so the Scripture were not over you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For doubting there were marvellous occasion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O animals terrene, O stolid minds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The primal will, that in itself is good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much is just as is accordant with it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No good created draws it to itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But it, by raying forth, occasions that.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as above her nest goes circling round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stork when she has fed her little ones,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who has been fed looks up at her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So lifted I my brows, and even such</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became the blessed image, which its wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was moving, by so many counsels urged.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Circling around it sang, and said: “As are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those lucent splendors of the Holy Spirit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew quiet then, but still within the standard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That made the Romans reverend to the world.</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">Lapsing and falling from my memory.</span>

					<span>O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee,</span>

					<span class="i1">How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silence imposed on the angelic bells,</span>

					<span>I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river</span>

					<span class="i1">That clear descendeth down from rock to rock,</span>

					<span class="i1">Showing the affluence of its mountain-top.</span>

					<span class="i1">First singing and then silent with content</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That overcometh the Divine volition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not in the guise that man o’ercometh man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But conquers it because it will be conquered,</span>

					<span>The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1761" id="noteref-1761" epub:type="noteref">1761</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cause thee astonishment, because with them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou seest the region of the angels painted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1762" id="noteref-1762" epub:type="noteref">1762</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto good will, returned unto his bones,</span>

					<span class="i1">And that of living hope was the reward⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of living hope, that placed its efficacy</span>

					<span class="i1">Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Believed in Him who had the power to aid it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, in believing, kindled to such fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of genuine love, that at the second death</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Worthy it was to come unto this joy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other one, through grace, that from so deep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1766" id="noteref-1766" epub:type="noteref">1766</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A fountain wells that never hath the eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of any creature reached its primal wave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Set all his love below on righteousness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eye to our redemption yet to be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he believed therein, and suffered not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that day forth the stench of paganism,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he reproved therefor the folk perverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1767" id="noteref-1767" epub:type="noteref">1767</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than a thousand years before baptizing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou predestination, how remote<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1768" id="noteref-1768" epub:type="noteref">1768</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy root is from the aspect of all those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who the First Cause do not behold entire!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In judging; for ourselves, who look on God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We do not know as yet all the elect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And sweet to us is such a deprivation,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because our good in this good is made perfect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That whatsoe’er God wills, we also will.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After this manner by that shape divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make clear in me my shortsightedness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was given to me a pleasant medicine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as good singer a good lutanist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accompanies with vibrations of the chords,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, while it spake, do I remember me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I beheld both of those blessed lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the winking of the eyes concords,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Moving unto the words their little flames.</span>

					<span class="i1">A stairway I beheld to such a height<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1773" id="noteref-1773" epub:type="noteref">1773</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise beheld I down the steps descending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So many splendors, that I thought each light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the heaven appears was there diffused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as accordant with their natural custom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rooks together at the break of day<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1774" id="noteref-1774" epub:type="noteref">1774</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then some of them fly off without return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Others come back to where they started from,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And others, wheeling round, still keep at home;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such fashion it appeared to me was there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the sparkling that together came,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as on a certain step it struck,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that which nearest unto us remained<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1775" id="noteref-1775" epub:type="noteref">1775</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became so clear, that in my thought I said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Well I perceive the love thou showest me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But she, from whom I wait the how and when<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1776" id="noteref-1776" epub:type="noteref">1776</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against desire do well if I ask not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She thereupon, who saw my silentness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the sight of Him who seeth everything,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me, “Let loose thy warm desire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “No merit of my own</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Renders me worthy of response from thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for her sake who granteth me the asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thy beatitude, make known to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause which draweth thee so near my side;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tell me why is silent in this wheel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dulcet symphony of Paradise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It answer made to me; “they sing not here,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1777" id="noteref-1777" epub:type="noteref">1777</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus far adown the holy stairway’s steps</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have I descended but to give thee welcome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With words, and with the light that mantles me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor did more love cause me to be more ready,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For love as much and more up there is burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the flaming manifest to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But the high charity, that makes us servants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prompt to the counsel which controls the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I see full well,” said I, “O sacred lamp!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How love unfettered in this court sufficeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To follow the eternal Providence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But this is what seems hard for me to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto this office from among thy consorts.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner had I come to the last word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than of its middle made the light a centre,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whirling itself about like a swift millstone.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1778" id="noteref-1778" epub:type="noteref">1778</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When answer made the love that was therein:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“On me directed is a light divine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Piercing through this in which I am embosomed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lifts me above myself so far, I see</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The supreme essence from which this is drawn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to my sight, as far as it is clear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The clearness of the flame I equal make.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1779" id="noteref-1779" epub:type="noteref">1779</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that soul in the heaven which is most pure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seraph which his eye on God most fixes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could this demand of thine not satisfy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because so deeply sinks in the abyss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal statute what thou askest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From all created sight it is cut off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the mortal world, when thou returnest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This carry back, that it may not presume</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Longer tow’rd such a goal to move its feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From this observe how can it do below</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such limit did its words prescribe to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The question I relinquished, and restricted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself to ask it humbly who it was.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1780" id="noteref-1780" epub:type="noteref">1780</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not far distant from thy native place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So high, the thunders far below them sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And form a ridge that Catria is called,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Neath which is consecrate a hermitage<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1781" id="noteref-1781" epub:type="noteref">1781</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wont to be dedicate to worship only.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me the third speech recommenced,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1782" id="noteref-1782" epub:type="noteref">1782</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, continuing, it said: “Therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto God’s service I became so steadfast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That feeding only on the juice of olives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contented in my thoughts contemplative.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That cloister used to render to these heavens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abundantly, and now is empty grown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that perforce it soon must be revealed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I in that place was Peter Damiano;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1783" id="noteref-1783" epub:type="noteref">1783</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Peter the Sinner was I in the house<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1784" id="noteref-1784" epub:type="noteref">1784</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little of mortal life remained to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was called and dragged forth to the hat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1785" id="noteref-1785" epub:type="noteref">1785</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1786" id="noteref-1786" epub:type="noteref">1786</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taking the food of any hostelry.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1787" id="noteref-1787" epub:type="noteref">1787</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now someone to support them on each side<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1788" id="noteref-1788" epub:type="noteref">1788</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So heavy are they, and to hold their trains.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that two beasts go underneath one skin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this voice saw I many little flames</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From step to step descending and revolving,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every revolution made them fairer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Round about this one came they and stood still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a cry uttered of so loud a sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It here could find no parallel, nor I</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Distinguished it, the thunder so o’ercame me.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1789" id="noteref-1789" epub:type="noteref">1789</a></span>

					<span>Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1790" id="noteref-1790" epub:type="noteref">1790</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned like a little child who always runs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For refuge there where he confideth most;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, even as a mother who straightway</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With voice whose wont it is to reassure him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Said to me: “Knowest thou not thou art in heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what is done here cometh from good zeal?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After what wise the singing would have changed thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since that the cry has startled thee so much,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In which if thou hadst understood its prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already would be known to thee the vengeance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sword above here smiteth not in haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor tardily, howe’er it seem to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who fearing or desiring waits for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But turn thee round towards the others now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou thy sight directest as I say.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw a hundred spherules that together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With mutual rays each other more embellished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I stood as one who in himself represses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The point of his desire, and ventures not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To question, he so feareth the too much.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now the largest and most luculent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among those pearls came forward, that it might</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make my desire concerning it content.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within it then I heard: “If thou couldst see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1791" id="noteref-1791" epub:type="noteref">1791</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as myself the charity that burns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among us, thy conceits would be expressed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the high end, I will make answer even</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the thought of which thou art so chary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1792" id="noteref-1792" epub:type="noteref">1792</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was frequented of old upon its summit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a deluded folk and ill-disposed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I am he who first up thither bore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1793" id="noteref-1793" epub:type="noteref">1793</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The name of Him who brought upon the earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The truth that so much sublimateth us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such abundant grace upon me shone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all the neighboring towns I drew away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the impious worship that seduced the world.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These other fires, each one of them, were men</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contemplative, enkindled by that heat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1794" id="noteref-1794" epub:type="noteref">1794</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “The affection which thou showest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speaking with me, and the good countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I behold and note in all your ardors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In me have so my confidence dilated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far unfolded as it hath the power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I may so much grace receive, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May thee behold with countenance unveiled.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thereupon: “Brother, thy high desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where are fulfilled all others and my own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There perfect is, and ripened, and complete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Every desire; within that one alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1795" id="noteref-1795" epub:type="noteref">1795</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is every part where it has always been;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For it is not in space, nor turns on poles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto it our stairway reaches up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1796" id="noteref-1796" epub:type="noteref">1796</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Extending its supernal part, what time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So thronged with angels it appeared to him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to ascend it now no one uplifts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below remaineth for mere waste of paper.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1797" id="noteref-1797" epub:type="noteref">1797</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The walls that used of old to be an Abbey</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1798" id="noteref-1798" epub:type="noteref">1798</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are sacks filled full of miserable flour.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But heavy usury is not taken up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1799" id="noteref-1799" epub:type="noteref">1799</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much against God’s pleasure as that fruit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which maketh so insane the heart of monks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is for the folk that ask it in God’s name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not for one’s kindred or for something worse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The flesh of mortals is so very soft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That good beginnings down below suffice not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From springing of the oak to bearing acorns.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peter began with neither gold nor silver,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I with orison and abstinence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Francis with humility his convent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou lookest at each one’s beginning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then regardest whither he has run,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In verity the Jordan backward turned,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1800" id="noteref-1800" epub:type="noteref">1800</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the sea’s fleeing, when God willed were more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wonder to behold, than succor here.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To his own band, and the band closed together;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The gentle Lady urged me on behind them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up o’er that stairway by a single sign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So did her virtue overcome my nature;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor here below, where one goes up and down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By natural law, was motion e’er so swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it could be compared unto my wing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reader, as I may unto that devout</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Triumph return, on whose account I often<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1801" id="noteref-1801" epub:type="noteref">1801</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For my transgressions weep and beat my breast⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And drawn it out again, before I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1802" id="noteref-1802" epub:type="noteref">1802</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All of my genius, whatsoe’er it be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With you was born, and hid himself with you,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1804" id="noteref-1804" epub:type="noteref">1804</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who is father of all mortal life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When first I tasted of the Tuscan air;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then when grace was freely given to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To enter the high wheel which turns you round,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1805" id="noteref-1805" epub:type="noteref">1805</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Your region was allotted unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To you devoutly at this hour my soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the stern pass that draws it to itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou art so near unto the last salvation,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus Beatrice began, “thou oughtest now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have thine eyes unclouded and acute;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, ere thou enter farther in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Look down once more, and see how vast a world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast already put beneath thy feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that thy heart, as jocund as it may,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Present itself to the triumphant throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I with my sight returned through one and all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1806" id="noteref-1806" epub:type="noteref">1806</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that opinion I approve as best</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which doth account it least; and he who thinks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of something else may truly be called just.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the daughter of Latona shining<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1807" id="noteref-1807" epub:type="noteref">1807</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without that shadow, which to me was cause</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That once I had believed her rare and dense.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1808" id="noteref-1808" epub:type="noteref">1808</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The aspect of thy son, Hyperion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1809" id="noteref-1809" epub:type="noteref">1809</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around and near him Maia and Dione.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1810" id="noteref-1810" epub:type="noteref">1810</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1811" id="noteref-1811" epub:type="noteref">1811</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt son and father, and to me was clear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The change that of their whereabout they make;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the seven made manifest to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How great they are, and eke how swift they are,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1812" id="noteref-1812" epub:type="noteref">1812</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how they are in distant habitations.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1813" id="noteref-1813" epub:type="noteref">1813</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me revolving with the eternal Twins,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was all apparent made from hill to harbour!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned.</span>

					<span>Even as a bird, ’mid the beloved leaves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1814" id="noteref-1814" epub:type="noteref">1814</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quiet upon the nest of her sweet brood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout the night, that hideth all things from us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1815" id="noteref-1815" epub:type="noteref">1815</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who, that she may behold their longed-for looks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And find the food wherewith to nourish them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which, to her, grave labors grateful are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Anticipates the time on open spray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with an ardent longing waits the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazing intent as soon as breaks the dawn:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus my Lady standing was, erect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And vigilant, turned round towards the zone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Underneath which the sun displays less haste;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1816" id="noteref-1816" epub:type="noteref">1816</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that beholding her distraught and wistful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such I became as he is who desiring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For something yearns, and hoping is appeased.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But brief the space from one When to the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The welkin grow resplendent more and more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Beatrice exclaimed: “Behold the hosts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Christ’s triumphal march, and all the fruit<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1817" id="noteref-1817" epub:type="noteref">1817</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1818" id="noteref-1818" epub:type="noteref">1818</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemed to me her face was all aflame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And eyes she had so full of ecstasy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I must needs pass on without describing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when in nights serene of the full moon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1819" id="noteref-1819" epub:type="noteref">1819</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saw I, above the myriads of lamps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Sun that one and all of them enkindled,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1820" id="noteref-1820" epub:type="noteref">1820</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en as our own doth the supernal sights,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1821" id="noteref-1821" epub:type="noteref">1821</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And through the living light transparent shone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lucent substance so intensely clear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into my sight, that I sustained it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me she said: “What overmasters thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A virtue is from which naught shields itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are the wisdom and the omnipotence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oped the thoroughfares ’twixt heaven and earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For which there erst had been so long a yearning.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dilating so it finds not room therein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And down, against its nature, falls to earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did my mind, among those aliments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Becoming larger, issue from itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that which it became cannot remember.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Open thine eyes, and look at what I am:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1822" id="noteref-1822" epub:type="noteref">1822</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was as one who still retains the feeling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a forgotten vision, and endeavors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vain to bring it back into his mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I this invitation heard, deserving</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of so much gratitude, it never fades</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the book that chronicles the past.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If at this moment sounded all the tongues</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Polyhymnia and her sisters made<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1823" id="noteref-1823" epub:type="noteref">1823</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most lubrical with their delicious milk,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It would not reach, singing the holy smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how the holy aspect it illumed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And therefore, representing Paradise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sacred poem must perforce leap over,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a man who finds his way cut off;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the mortal shoulder laden with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should blame it not, if under this it tremble.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It is no passage for a little boat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This which goes cleaving the audacious prow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor for a pilot who would spare himself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why doth my face so much enamour thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1824" id="noteref-1824" epub:type="noteref">1824</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to the garden fair thou turnest not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is the Rose in which the Word Divine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1825" id="noteref-1825" epub:type="noteref">1825</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became incarnate; there the lilies are<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1826" id="noteref-1826" epub:type="noteref">1826</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By whose perfume the good way was discovered.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wholly ready, once again betook me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the battle of the feeble brows.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1827" id="noteref-1827" epub:type="noteref">1827</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes with shadow covered o’er have seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So troops of splendors manifold I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Illumined from above with burning rays,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beholding not the source of the effulgence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O power benignant that dost so imprint them!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1828" id="noteref-1828" epub:type="noteref">1828</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The name of that fair flower I e’er invoke<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1829" id="noteref-1829" epub:type="noteref">1829</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Morning and evening utterly enthralled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul to gaze upon the greater fire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1830" id="noteref-1830" epub:type="noteref">1830</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when in both mine eyes depicted were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glory and greatness of the living star<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1831" id="noteref-1831" epub:type="noteref">1831</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there excelleth, as it here excelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Athwart the heavens a little torch descended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1832" id="noteref-1832" epub:type="noteref">1832</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed in a circle like a coronal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On earth, and to itself most draws the soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Compared unto the sounding of that lyre</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1833" id="noteref-1833" epub:type="noteref">1833</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am Angelic Love, that circle round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was the hostelry of our Desire;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1834" id="noteref-1834" epub:type="noteref">1834</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou followest thy Son, and mak’st diviner</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did the circulated melody</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seal itself up; and all the other lights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were making to resound the name of Mary.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The regal mantle of the volumes all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1835" id="noteref-1835" epub:type="noteref">1835</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that world, which most fervid is and living</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With breath of God and with his works and ways,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Extended over us its inner border,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1836" id="noteref-1836" epub:type="noteref">1836</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So very distant, that the semblance of it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where I was not yet appeared to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of following the incoronated flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mounted upward near to its own seed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1837" id="noteref-1837" epub:type="noteref">1837</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a little child, that towards its mother</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through impulse kindled into outward flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So with its summit, that the deep affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had for Mary was revealed to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter they remained there in my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Regina coeli</i> singing with such sweetness,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1838" id="noteref-1838" epub:type="noteref">1838</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ne’er from me has the delight departed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O, what exuberance is garnered up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within those richest coffers, which had been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Good husbandmen for sowing here below!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There they enjoy and live upon the treasure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was acquired while weeping in the exile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1839" id="noteref-1839" epub:type="noteref">1839</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of God and Mary, in his victory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both with the ancient council and the new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who doth keep the keys of such a glory.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1840" id="noteref-1840" epub:type="noteref">1840</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Lamb benedight, who feedeth you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that forever full is your desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If by the grace of God this man foretaste</span>

					<span class="i1">Something of that which falleth from your table,</span>

					<span>Thus Beatrice; and those souls beatified</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Transformed themselves to spheres on steadfast poles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Flaming intensely in the guise of comets.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In different measure, of their affluence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1843" id="noteref-1843" epub:type="noteref">1843</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1845" id="noteref-1845" epub:type="noteref">1845</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That none it left there of a greater brightness;</span>

					<span>And around Beatrice three several times<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1846" id="noteref-1846" epub:type="noteref">1846</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It whirled itself with so divine a song,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My fantasy repeats it not to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since our imagination for such folds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1847" id="noteref-1847" epub:type="noteref">1847</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O holy sister mine, who us implorest<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1848" id="noteref-1848" epub:type="noteref">1848</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such devotion, by thine ardent love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Lady did direct its breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which spake in fashion as I here have said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she: “O light eterne of the great man</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom our Lord delivered up the keys</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He carried down of this miraculous joy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one examine on points light and grave,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of which thou on the sea didst walk.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If he love well, and hope well, and believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thee ’tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1849" id="noteref-1849" epub:type="noteref">1849</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where depicted everything is seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since this kingdom has made citizens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of the true Faith, to glorify it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the master doth propose the question,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To argue it, and not to terminate it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did I arm myself with every reason,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While she was speaking, that I might be ready</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For such a questioner and such profession.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What is the Faith?” Whereat I raised my brow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prompt signals made to me that I should pour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The water forth from my internal fountain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“May grace, that suffers me to make confession,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I, “to the great centurion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1850" id="noteref-1850" epub:type="noteref">1850</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I continued: “As the truthful pen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1851" id="noteref-1851" epub:type="noteref">1851</a></span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span>Then heard I: “Very rightly thou perceivest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If well thou understandest why he placed it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With substances and then with evidences.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I thereafterward: “The things profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That here vouchsafe to me their apparition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto all eyes below are so concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That they exist there only in belief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the which is founded the high hope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hence it takes the nature of a substance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it behoveth us from this belief</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To reason without having other sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hence it has the nature of evidence.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1854" id="noteref-1854" epub:type="noteref">1854</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then heard I: “If whatever is acquired</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below by doctrine were thus understood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No sophist’s subtlety would there find place.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then added: “Very well has been gone over</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already of this coin the alloy and weight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I: “Yes, both so shining and so round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in its stamp there is no peradventure.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1855" id="noteref-1855" epub:type="noteref">1855</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter issued from the light profound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there resplendent was: “This precious jewel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the which is every virtue founded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence hadst thou it?” And I: “The large outpouring</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the ancient parchments and the new,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1856" id="noteref-1856" epub:type="noteref">1856</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A syllogism is, which proved it to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such acuteness, that, compared therewith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All demonstration seems to me obtuse.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then I heard: “The ancient and the new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why dost thou take them for the word divine?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “The proofs, which show the truth to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twas answered me: “Say, who assureth thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That those works ever were? the thing itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Were the world to Christianity converted,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “withouten miracles, this one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the field to sow there the good plant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which was a vine and has become a thorn!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This being finished, the high, holy Court</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Resounded through the spheres, “One God we praise!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In melody that there above is chanted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then that Baron, who from branch to branch,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1857" id="noteref-1857" epub:type="noteref">1857</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Examining, had thus conducted me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till the extremest leaves we were approaching,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Again began: “The Grace that dallying<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1858" id="noteref-1858" epub:type="noteref">1858</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to this point, as it should opened be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that I do approve what forth emerged;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now thou must express what thou believest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whence to thy belief it was presented.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O holy father, spirit who beholdest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou believedst so that thou o’ercamest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1859" id="noteref-1859" epub:type="noteref">1859</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began I, “thou dost wish me in this place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The form to manifest of my prompt belief,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I respond: In one God I believe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With love and with desire, himself unmoved;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1860" id="noteref-1860" epub:type="noteref">1860</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of such faith not only have I proofs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Physical and metaphysical, but gives them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Likewise the truth that from this place rains down</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1861" id="noteref-1861" epub:type="noteref">1861</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the fiery Spirit sanctified you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In Persons three eterne believe, and these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One essence I believe, so one and trine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They bear conjunction both with <i xml:lang="la">sunt</i> and <i xml:lang="la">est</i>.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1862" id="noteref-1862" epub:type="noteref">1862</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the profound condition and divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This the beginning is, this is the spark</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His servant straight embraces, gratulating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the good news as soon as he is silent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, giving me its benediction, singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three times encircled me, when I was silent,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1863" id="noteref-1863" epub:type="noteref">1863</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The apostolic light, at whose command</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him.</span>

					<span class="i1">So that it many a year hath made me lean,</span>

					<span>O’ercome the cruelty that bars me out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the fair sheepfold, where a lamb I slumbered,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1865" id="noteref-1865" epub:type="noteref">1865</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An enemy to the wolves that war upon it,</span>

					<span>With other voice forthwith, with other fleece<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1866" id="noteref-1866" epub:type="noteref">1866</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Poet will I return, and at my font<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1867" id="noteref-1867" epub:type="noteref">1867</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Baptismal will I take the laurel crown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because into the Faith that maketh known</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All souls to God there entered I, and then</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Peter for her sake thus my brow encircled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1868" id="noteref-1868" epub:type="noteref">1868</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward towards us moved a light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1869" id="noteref-1869" epub:type="noteref">1869</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of his vicars Christ behind him left,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then my Lady, full of ecstasy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said unto me: “Look, look! behold the Baron<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1870" id="noteref-1870" epub:type="noteref">1870</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whom below Galicia is frequented.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same way as, when a dove alights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Near his companion, both of them pour forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Circling about and murmuring, their affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So one beheld I by the other grand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lauding the food that there above is eaten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when their gratulations were complete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silently <i xml:lang="la">coram me</i> each one stood still,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1871" id="noteref-1871" epub:type="noteref">1871</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So incandescent it o’ercame my sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1872" id="noteref-1872" epub:type="noteref">1872</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of our Basilica have been described,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Make Hope resound within this altitude;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1873" id="noteref-1873" epub:type="noteref">1873</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.”⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1874" id="noteref-1874" epub:type="noteref">1874</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For what comes hither from the mortal world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must needs be ripened in our radiance.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1875" id="noteref-1875" epub:type="noteref">1875</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>This comfort came to me from the second fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1876" id="noteref-1876" epub:type="noteref">1876</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which bent them down before with too great weight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the most secret chamber, with his Counts,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1877" id="noteref-1877" epub:type="noteref">1877</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that, the truth beholden of this court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hope, which below there rightfully enamours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say what it is, and how is flowering with it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus did the second light again continue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the Compassionate, who piloted<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1878" id="noteref-1878" epub:type="noteref">1878</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plumage of my wings in such high flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did in reply anticipate me thus:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“No child whatever the Church Militant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of greater hope possesses, as is written</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that Sun which irradiates all our band;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1879" id="noteref-1879" epub:type="noteref">1879</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To come into Jerusalem to see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever yet his warfare be completed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The two remaining points, that not for knowledge<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1880" id="noteref-1880" epub:type="noteref">1880</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have been demanded, but that he report</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him I leave; for hard he will not find them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1881" id="noteref-1881" epub:type="noteref">1881</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And may the grace of God in this assist him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As a disciple, who his teacher follows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ready and willing, where he is expert,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That his proficiency may be displayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Hope,” said I, “is the certain expectation<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1882" id="noteref-1882" epub:type="noteref">1882</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of future glory, which is the effect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of grace divine and merit precedent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From many stars this light comes unto me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But he instilled it first into my heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was chief singer unto the chief captain.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1883" id="noteref-1883" epub:type="noteref">1883</a></span>

					<span class="i1">He sayeth, ‘those who know thy name’; and who</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the Epistle, so that I am full,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And upon others rain again your rain.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1885" id="noteref-1885" epub:type="noteref">1885</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I was speaking, in the living bosom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that combustion quivered an effulgence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then breathed: “The love wherewith I am inflamed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the virtue still which followed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the palm and issue of the field,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1886" id="noteref-1886" epub:type="noteref">1886</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In her; and grateful to me is thy telling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever things Hope promises to thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “The ancient Scriptures and the new</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mark establish, and this shows it me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1887" id="noteref-1887" epub:type="noteref">1887</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1888" id="noteref-1888" epub:type="noteref">1888</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Isaiah saith, that each one garmented<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1889" id="noteref-1889" epub:type="noteref">1889</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his own land shall be with twofold garments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And his own land is this delightful life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy brother, too, far more explicitly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where he treateth of the robes of white,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1890" id="noteref-1890" epub:type="noteref">1890</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This revelation manifests to us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And first, and near the ending of these words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Sperent in te</i>” from over us was heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which responsive answered all the carols.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward a light among them brightened,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1891" id="noteref-1891" epub:type="noteref">1891</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that, if Cancer one such crystal had,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1892" id="noteref-1892" epub:type="noteref">1892</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Winter would have a month of one sole day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A winsome maiden, only to do honor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the new bride, and not from any failing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1893" id="noteref-1893" epub:type="noteref">1893</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus did I behold the brightened splendor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1894" id="noteref-1894" epub:type="noteref">1894</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was beseeming to their ardent love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Into the song and music there it entered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fixed on them my Lady kept her look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a bride silent and motionless.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This is the one who lay upon the breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of him our Pelican; and this is he<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1895" id="noteref-1895" epub:type="noteref">1895</a></span>

					<span class="i1">To the great office from the cross elected.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1896" id="noteref-1896" epub:type="noteref">1896</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady thus; but therefore none the more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did move her sight from its attentive gaze</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before or afterward these words of hers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a man who gazes, and endeavors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see the eclipsing of the sun a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who, by seeing, sightless doth become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I became before that latest fire,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1897" id="noteref-1897" epub:type="noteref">1897</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While it was said, “Why dost thou daze thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see a thing which here hath no existence?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the others there, until our number</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the eternal proposition tallies.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1898" id="noteref-1898" epub:type="noteref">1898</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the two garments in the blessed cloister<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1899" id="noteref-1899" epub:type="noteref">1899</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are the two lights alone that have ascended:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1900" id="noteref-1900" epub:type="noteref">1900</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this shalt thou take back into your world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at this utterance the flaming circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grew quiet, with the dulcet intermingling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sound that by the trinal breath was made,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1901" id="noteref-1901" epub:type="noteref">1901</a></span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The oars that erst were in the water beaten</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are all suspended at a whistle’s sound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah, how much in my mind was I disturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I turned round to look on Beatrice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That her I could not see, although I was<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1902" id="noteref-1902" epub:type="noteref">1902</a></span>

					<span>While I was doubting for my vision quenched,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1903" id="noteref-1903" epub:type="noteref">1903</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of the flame refulgent that had quenched it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued a breathing, that attentive made me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying: “While thou recoverest the sense</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of seeing which in me thou hast consumed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis well that speaking thou shouldst compensate it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Begin then, and declare to what thy soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is aimed, and count it for a certainty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sight is in thee bewildered and not dead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the Lady, who through this divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Region conducteth thee, has in her look</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power the hand of Ananias had.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1904" id="noteref-1904" epub:type="noteref">1904</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I said: “As pleaseth her, or soon or late</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let the cure come to eyes that portals were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When she with fire I ever burn with entered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Good, that gives contentment to this Court,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Alpha and Omega is of all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1905" id="noteref-1905" epub:type="noteref">1905</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The writing that love reads me low or loud.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The selfsame voice, that taken had from me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The terror of the sudden dazzlement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak still farther put it in my thought;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “In verity with finer sieve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoveth thee to sift; thee it behoveth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To say who aimed thy bow at such a target.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “By philosophic arguments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by authority that hence descends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such love must needs imprint itself in me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For Good, so far as good, when comprehended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth straight enkindle love, and so much greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As more of goodness in itself it holds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to that Essence (whose is such advantage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That every good which out of it is found</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is nothing but a ray of its own light)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More than elsewhither must the mind be moved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of everyone, in loving, who discerns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The truth in which this evidence is founded.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such truth he to my intellect reveals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who demonstrates to me the primal love<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1906" id="noteref-1906" epub:type="noteref">1906</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all the sempiternal substances.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1907" id="noteref-1907" epub:type="noteref">1907</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The voice reveals it of the truthful Author,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who says to Moses, speaking of Himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘I will make all my goodness pass before thee.’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1908" id="noteref-1908" epub:type="noteref">1908</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou too revealest it to me, beginning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The loud Evangel, that proclaims the secret<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1909" id="noteref-1909" epub:type="noteref">1909</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of heaven to earth above all other edict.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I heard say: “By human intellect<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1910" id="noteref-1910" epub:type="noteref">1910</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by authority concordant with it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of all thy loves reserve for God the highest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But say again if other cords thou feelest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Draw thee towards Him, that thou mayst proclaim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With how many teeth this love is biting thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The holy purpose of the Eagle of Christ<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1911" id="noteref-1911" epub:type="noteref">1911</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not latent was, nay, rather I perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whither he fain would my profession lead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I recommenced: “All of those bites</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have the power to turn the heart to God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my charity have been concurrent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The being of the world, and my own being,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The death which He endured that I may live,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that which all the faithful hope, as I do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the forementioned vivid consciousness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the right have placed me on the shore.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1912" id="noteref-1912" epub:type="noteref">1912</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as he has granted them of good.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said with the others, “Holy, holy, holy!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1913" id="noteref-1913" epub:type="noteref">1913</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as at some keen light one wakes from sleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the visual spirit that runs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the splendor passed from coat to coat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So all unconscious is his sudden waking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the judgment cometh to his aid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So from before mine eyes did Beatrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Chase every mote with radiance of her own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cast its light a thousand miles and more.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence better after than before I saw,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in a kind of wonderment I asked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About a fourth light that I saw with us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said my Lady: “There within those rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gazes upon its Maker the first soul<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1914" id="noteref-1914" epub:type="noteref">1914</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever the first virtue did create.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the bough that downward bends its top</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At transit of the wind, and then is lifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By its own virtue, which inclines it upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Being amazed, and then I was made bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a desire to speak wherewith I burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I began: “O apple, that mature<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1915" id="noteref-1915" epub:type="noteref">1915</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Alone hast been produced, O ancient father,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that his impulse needs must be apparent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the wrappage following it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in like manner the primeval soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made clear to me athwart its covering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How jubilant it was to give me pleasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then breathed: “Without thy uttering it to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine inclination better I discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For I behold it in the truthful mirror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of Himself all things parhelion makes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1916" id="noteref-1916" epub:type="noteref">1916</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And none makes Him parhelion of itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the lofty garden, where this Lady</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto so long a stairway thee disposed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And of the great disdain the proper cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the language that I used and that I made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not in itself was cause of so great exile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But solely the o’erstepping of the bounds.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1917" id="noteref-1917" epub:type="noteref">1917</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made by the sun, this Council I desired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him I saw return to all the lights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The language that I spake was quite extinct<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1918" id="noteref-1918" epub:type="noteref">1918</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before that in the work interminable</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people under Nimrod were employed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For nevermore result of reasoning</span>

					<span class="i1">But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave</span>

					<span class="i1">The love that turns it, and the power it rains.</span>

					<span class="i1">Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must close perforce before such great acuteness.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And whatsoever star seems smallest here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one star with another star is placed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perhaps at such a distance as appears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A halo cincturing the light that paints it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When densest is the vapor that sustains it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus distant round the point a circle of fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whatever motion soonest girds the world;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this was by another circumcinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by a third, the third then by a fourth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The seventh followed thereupon in width</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So ample now, that Juno’s messenger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1969" id="noteref-1969" epub:type="noteref">1969</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entire would be too narrow to contain it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even so the eighth and ninth; and everyone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1970" id="noteref-1970" epub:type="noteref">1970</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More slowly moved, according as it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In number distant farther from the first.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that one had its flame most crystalline</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which less distant was the stainless spark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think because more with its truth imbued.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady, who in my anxiety</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld me much perplexed, said: “From that point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dependent is the heaven and nature all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold that circle most conjoined to it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And know thou, that its motion is so swift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through burning love whereby it is spurred on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to her: “If the world were arranged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the order which I see in yonder wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What’s set before me would have satisfied me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the world of sense we can perceive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That evermore the circles are diviner</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As they are from the centre more remote</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore if my desire is to be ended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this miraculous and angelic temple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That has for confines only love and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To hear behoves me still how the example<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1971" id="noteref-1971" epub:type="noteref">1971</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the exemplar go not in one fashion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since for myself in vain I contemplate it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thine own fingers unto such a knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be insufficient, it is no great wonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So hard hath it become for want of trying.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1972" id="noteref-1972" epub:type="noteref">1972</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Lady thus; then said she: “Do thou take</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And exercise on that thy subtlety.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The circles corporal are wide and narrow<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1973" id="noteref-1973" epub:type="noteref">1973</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to the more or less of virtue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is distributed through all their parts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The greater goodness works the greater weal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The greater weal the greater body holds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If perfect equally are all its parts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore this one which sweeps along with it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1974" id="noteref-1974" epub:type="noteref">1974</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The universe sublime, doth correspond</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the circle which most loves and knows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which account, if thou unto the virtue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apply thy measure, not to the appearance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of substances that unto thee seem round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of more to greater, and of less to smaller,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1975" id="noteref-1975" epub:type="noteref">1975</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In every heaven, with its Intelligence.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as remaineth splendid and serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hemisphere of air, when Boreas<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1976" id="noteref-1976" epub:type="noteref">1976</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because is purified and resolved the rack</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With all the beauties of its pageantry;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had me provided with her clear response,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like a star in heaven the truth was seen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And soon as to a stop her words had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not otherwise does iron scintillate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When molten, than those circles scintillated.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1977" id="noteref-1977" epub:type="noteref">1977</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Their coruscation all the sparks repeated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they so many were, their number makes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More millions than the doubling of the chess.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1978" id="noteref-1978" epub:type="noteref">1978</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the fixed point which holds them at the <i xml:lang="la">Ubi</i>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1979" id="noteref-1979" epub:type="noteref">1979</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever will, where they have ever been.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, who saw the dubious meditations</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within my mind, “The primal circles,” said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1980" id="noteref-1980" epub:type="noteref">1980</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1981" id="noteref-1981" epub:type="noteref">1981</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be as like the point as most they can,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And can as far as they are high in vision.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those other Loves, that round about them go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrones of the countenance divine are called,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1982" id="noteref-1982" epub:type="noteref">1982</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they terminate the primal Triad.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou shouldst know that they all have delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as their own vision penetrates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From this it may be seen how blessedness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is founded in the faculty which sees,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1983" id="noteref-1983" epub:type="noteref">1983</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not in that which loves, and follows next;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of this seeing merit is the measure,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1984" id="noteref-1984" epub:type="noteref">1984</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second Triad, which is germinating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such wise in this sempiternal spring,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1985" id="noteref-1985" epub:type="noteref">1985</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That no nocturnal Aries despoils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perpetually hosanna warbles forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With threefold melody, that sounds in three</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Orders of joy, with which it is intrined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The three Divine are in this hierarchy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First the Dominions, and the Virtues next;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1986" id="noteref-1986" epub:type="noteref">1986</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the third order is that of the Powers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then in the dances twain penultimate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Principalities and Archangels wheel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The last is wholly of angelic sports.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These orders upward all of them are gazing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And downward so prevail, that unto God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They all attracted are and all attract.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Dionysius with so great desire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1987" id="noteref-1987" epub:type="noteref">1987</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To contemplate these Orders set himself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He named them and distinguished them as I do.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Gregory afterwards dissented from him;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1988" id="noteref-1988" epub:type="noteref">1988</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within this heaven, he at himself did smile.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if so much of secret truth a mortal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he who saw it here revealed it to him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1989" id="noteref-1989" epub:type="noteref">1989</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With much more of the truth about these circles.”</span>

					<span class="i1">Which thou discernest, with so great delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never from their circling do they cease.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The occasion of the fall was the accursed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2011" id="noteref-2011" epub:type="noteref">2011</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>I would not have thee doubt, but certain be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis meritorious to receive this grace,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2012" id="noteref-2012" epub:type="noteref">2012</a></span>

					<span>But since upon the earth, throughout your schools,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They teach that such is the angelic nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it doth hear, and recollect, and will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The truth that is confounded there below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Equivocating in suchlike prelections.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These substances, since in God’s countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They jocund were, turned not away their sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From that wherefrom not anything is hidden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence they have not their vision intercepted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By object new, and hence they do not need</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To recollect, through interrupted thought.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that below, not sleeping, people dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Believing they speak truth, and not believing;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the last is greater sin and shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Below you do not journey by one path</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Philosophising; so transporteth you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love of appearance and the thought thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even this above here is endured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With less disdain, than when is set aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They think not there how much of blood it costs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sow it in the world, and how he pleases</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in humility keeps close to it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each striveth for appearance, and doth make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His own inventions; and these treated are<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2013" id="noteref-2013" epub:type="noteref">2013</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace.</span>

					<span>One sayeth that the moon did backward turn,</span>

					<span class="i1">In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sunlight reached not down below;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lies; for of its own accord the light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2014" id="noteref-2014" epub:type="noteref">2014</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fables such as these, that every year</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such wise that the lambs, who do not know,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not to see the harm doth not excuse them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Christ did not to his first disciples say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">‘Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But unto them a true foundation gave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this so loudly sounded from their lips,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They made of the Evangel shields and lances.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now men go forth with jests and drolleries<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2016" id="noteref-2016" epub:type="noteref">2016</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To preach, and if but well the people laugh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the cowl there nestles such a bird,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2017" id="noteref-2017" epub:type="noteref">2017</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, if the common people were to see it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They would perceive what pardons they confide in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For which so great on earth has grown the folly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, without proof of any testimony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To each indulgence they would flock together.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2018" id="noteref-2018" epub:type="noteref">2018</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many others, who are worse than pigs,</span>

					<span class="i1">Paying in money without mark of coinage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2019" id="noteref-2019" epub:type="noteref">2019</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since we have digressed abundantly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the way be shortened with the time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This nature doth so multiply itself<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2020" id="noteref-2020" epub:type="noteref">2020</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In numbers, that there never yet was speech</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor mortal fancy that can go so far.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou notest that which is revealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2021" id="noteref-2021" epub:type="noteref">2021</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Number determinate is kept concealed.</span>

					<span>The primal light, that all irradiates it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2022" id="noteref-2022" epub:type="noteref">2022</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plays round about the point that vanquished me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little by little from my vision faded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My seeing nothing and my love constrained me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If what has hitherto been said of her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were all concluded in a single praise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scant would it be to serve the present turn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only does the beauty I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its Maker only may enjoy it all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vanquished do I confess me by this passage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than by problem of his theme was ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’ercome the comic or the tragic poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For as the sun the sight that trembles most,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so the memory of that sweet smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mind depriveth of its very self.</span>

					<span>From the first day that I beheld her face</span>

					<span class="i1">In this life, to the moment of this look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sequence of my song has ne’er been severed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now perforce this sequence must desist</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From following her beauty with my verse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As every artist at his uttermost.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such as I leave her to a greater fame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its arduous matter to a final close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With voice and gesture of a perfect leader</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She recommenced: “We from the greatest body<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2028" id="noteref-2028" epub:type="noteref">2028</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have issued to the heaven that is pure light;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Light intellectual replete with love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love of true good replete with ecstasy,</span>

					<span>Even as a sudden lightning that disperses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The visual spirits, so that it deprives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eye of impress from the strongest objects,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus round about me flashed a living light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And left me swathed around with such a veil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Welcomes into itself with such salute,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To make the candle ready for its flame.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner had within me these brief words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An entrance found, than I perceived myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be uplifted over my own power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I with vision new rekindled me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that no light whatever is so pure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But that mine eyes were fortified against it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And light I saw in fashion of a river<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2032" id="noteref-2032" epub:type="noteref">2032</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fulvid with its effulgence, ’twixt two banks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Depicted with an admirable Spring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of this river issued living sparks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2033" id="noteref-2033" epub:type="noteref">2033</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on all sides sank down into the flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like unto rubies that are set in gold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2034" id="noteref-2034" epub:type="noteref">2034</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, as if inebriate with the odors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They plunged again into the wondrous torrent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as one entered issued forth another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To have intelligence of what thou seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But of this water it behoves thee drink</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And added: “The river and the topazes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2035" id="noteref-2035" epub:type="noteref">2035</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that these things are difficult in themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But the deficiency is on thy side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is no babe that leaps so suddenly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With face towards the milk, if he awake</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Much later than his usual custom is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I did, that I might make better mirrors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which flows that we therein be better made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of its length to be transformed to round.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2036" id="noteref-2036" epub:type="noteref">2036</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then as a folk who have been under masks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seem other than before, if they divest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The semblance not their own they disappeared in,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus into greater pomp were changed for me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O splendor of God! by means of which I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lofty triumph of the realm veracious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give me the power to say how it I saw!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2037" id="noteref-2037" epub:type="noteref">2037</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There is a light above, which visible<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2038" id="noteref-2038" epub:type="noteref">2038</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes the Creator unto every creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who only in beholding Him has peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And it expands itself in circular form</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To such extent, that its circumference</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be too large a girdle for the sun.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The semblance of it is all made of rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reflected from the top of Primal Motion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which takes therefrom vitality and power.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a hill in water at its base</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When affluent most in verdure and in flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So, ranged aloft all round about the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All who above there have from us returned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the lowest row collect within it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great a light, how vast the amplitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My vision in the vastness and the height</span>
					<br/>

					<span class="i1">No snow unto that limit doth attain.</span>

					<span class="i1">From Florence to a people just and sane,</span>

					<span>With what amazement must I have been filled!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Truly between this and the joy, it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a pilgrim who delighteth him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In gazing round the temple of his vow,</span>

					<span class="i1">And hopes some day to retell how it was,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now up, now down, and now all round about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faces I saw of charity persuasive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Embellished by His light and their own smile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And attitudes adorned with every grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The general form of Paradise already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My glance had comprehended as a whole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In no part hitherto remaining fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And round I turned me with rekindled wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Lady to interrogate of things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Concerning which my mind was in suspense.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One thing I meant, another answered me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An Old Man habited like the glorious people.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With joy benign, in attitude of pity</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to a tender father is becoming.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And “She, where is she?” instantly I said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he: “To put an end to thy desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thou lookest up to the third round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without reply I lifted up mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw her, as she made herself a crown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reflecting from herself the eternal rays.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not from that region which the highest thunders<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2052" id="noteref-2052" epub:type="noteref">2052</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is any mortal eye so far removed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As there from Beatrice my sight; but this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was nothing unto me; because her image</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Descended not to me by medium blurred.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who for my salvation didst endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of whatsoever things I have beheld,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As coming from thy power and from thy goodness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I recognise the virtue and the grace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all those ways, by all the expedients,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preserve towards me thy magnificence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I implored; and she, so far away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then unto the eternal fountain turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the Old Man holy: “That thou mayst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Accomplish perfectly thy journeying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For seeing it will discipline thy sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Farther to mount along the ray divine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wholly with love, will grant us every grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because that I her faithful Bernard am.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2053" id="noteref-2053" epub:type="noteref">2053</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he who peradventure from Croatia</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cometh to gaze at our Veronica,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2054" id="noteref-2054" epub:type="noteref">2054</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through its ancient fame is never sated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But says in thought, the while it is displayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now was your semblance made like unto this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was I while gazing at the living</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Charity of the man, who in this world</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By contemplation tasted of that peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thou son of grace, this jocund life,” began he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Will not be known to thee by keeping ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine eyes below here on the lowest place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But mark the circles to the most remote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2055" id="noteref-2055" epub:type="noteref">2055</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To whom this realm is subject and devoted.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The oriental part of the horizon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Surpass in splendor all the other front.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as there where we await the pole</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2056" id="noteref-2056" epub:type="noteref">2056</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The light, and is on either side diminished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So likewise that pacific oriflamme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In equal measure did the flame abate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at that centre, with their wings expanded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each differing in effulgence and in kind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw there at their sports and at their songs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A beauty smiling, which the gladness was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the eyes of all the other saints;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if I had in speaking as much wealth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in imagining, I should not dare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To attempt the smallest part of its delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bernard, as soon as he beheld mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fixed and intent upon its fervid fervor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His own with such affection turned to her</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it made mine more ardent to behold.</span>

					<span>After the earlier ages were completed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2072" id="noteref-2072" epub:type="noteref">2072</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoved it that the males by circumcision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto their innocent wings should virtue add;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But after that the time of grace had come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without the baptism absolute of Christ,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such innocence below there was retained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look now into the face that unto Christ<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2073" id="noteref-2073" epub:type="noteref">2073</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On her did I behold so great a gladness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Created through that altitude to fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That whatsoever I had seen before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not suspend me in such admiration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor show me such similitude of God.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the same Love that first descended there,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2074" id="noteref-2074" epub:type="noteref">2074</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Ave Maria, gratia plena</i>,” singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of her his wings expanded wide.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto the canticle divine responded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From every part the court beatified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that each sight became serener for it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2075" id="noteref-2075" epub:type="noteref">2075</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O holy father, who for me endurest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be below here, leaving the sweet place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which thou sittest by eternal lot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who is the Angel that with so much joy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the eyes is looking of our Queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus I again recourse had to the teaching</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that one who delighted him in Mary<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2076" id="noteref-2076" epub:type="noteref">2076</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the star of morning in the sun.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2077" id="noteref-2077" epub:type="noteref">2077</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Such gallantry and grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As there can be in Angel and in soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All is in him; and thus we fain would have it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because he is the one who bore the palm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down unto Mary, when the Son of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take our burden on himself decreed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But now come onward with thine eyes, as I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this most just and merciful of empires.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those two that sit above there most enrapture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As being very near unto Augusta,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2078" id="noteref-2078" epub:type="noteref">2078</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are as it were the two roots of this Rose.</span>

					<span>He who upon the left is near her placed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2079" id="noteref-2079" epub:type="noteref">2079</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The father is, by whose audacious taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human species so much bitter tastes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the right thou seest that ancient father<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2080" id="noteref-2080" epub:type="noteref">2080</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The keys committed of this lovely flower.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who all the evil days beheld,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2081" id="noteref-2081" epub:type="noteref">2081</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before his death, of her the beauteous bride</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the spear and with the nails was won,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beside him sits, and by the other rests</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That leader under whom on manna lived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2082" id="noteref-2082" epub:type="noteref">2082</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2083" id="noteref-2083" epub:type="noteref">2083</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2084" id="noteref-2084" epub:type="noteref">2084</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So well content to look upon her daughter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And opposite the eldest household father</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2085" id="noteref-2085" epub:type="noteref">2085</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since the moments of thy vision fly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who makes the gown according to his cloth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto the first Love will turn our eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That looking upon Him thou penetrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far as possible through his effulgence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly, lest peradventure thou recede,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving thy wings believing to advance,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2086" id="noteref-2086" epub:type="noteref">2086</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt follow me with thy affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from my words thy heart turn not aside.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he began this holy orison.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Humble and high beyond all other creature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The limit fixed of the eternal counsel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou art the one who such nobility</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To human nature gave, that its Creator</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not disdain to make himself its creature.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within thy womb rekindled was the love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By heat of which in the eternal peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After such wise this flower has germinated.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here unto us thou art a noonday torch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of charity, and below there among mortals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou art the living fountainhead of hope.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His aspirations without wings would fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only thy benignity gives succor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him who asketh it, but oftentimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forerunneth of its own accord the asking.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In thee compassion is, in thee is pity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thee magnificence; in thee unites</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er of goodness is in any creature.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the universe as far as here has seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One after one the spiritual lives,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Supplicate thee through grace for so much power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with his eyes he may uplift himself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Higher towards the uttermost salvation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who never burned for my own seeing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than I do for his, all of my prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of his mortality so with thy prayers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After so great a vision his affections.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2088" id="noteref-2088" epub:type="noteref">2088</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let thy protection conquer human movements;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See Beatrice and all the blessed ones</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The eyes beloved and revered of God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How grateful unto her are prayers devout;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then unto the Eternal Light they turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which it is not credible could be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By any creature bent an eye so clear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who to the end of all desires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was now approaching, even as I ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ardor of desire within me ended.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2089" id="noteref-2089" epub:type="noteref">2089</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I should upward look; but I already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of my own accord such as he wished;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because my sight, becoming purified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was entering more and more into the ray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the High Light which of itself is true.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From that time forward what I saw was greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than our discourse, that to such vision yields,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yields the memory unto such excess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as he is who seeth in a dream,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after dreaming the imprinted passion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such am I, for almost utterly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within my heart the sweetness born of it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2090" id="noteref-2090" epub:type="noteref">2090</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the conceits of mortals, to my mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And make my tongue of so great puissance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That but a single sparkle of thy glory</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It may bequeath unto the future people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For by returning to my memory somewhat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And by a little sounding in these verses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More of thy victory shall be conceived!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think the keenness of the living ray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I endured would have bewildered me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If but mine eyes had been averted from it;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2091" id="noteref-2091" epub:type="noteref">2091</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I remember that I was more bold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On this account to bear, so that I joined</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My aspect with the Glory Infinite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O grace abundant, by which I presumed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the seeing I consumed therein!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that in its depth far down is lying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bound up with love together in one volume,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2092" id="noteref-2092" epub:type="noteref">2092</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What through the universe in leaves is scattered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Substance, and accident, and their operations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All interfused together in such wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That what I speak of is one simple light.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2093" id="noteref-2093" epub:type="noteref">2093</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The universal fashion of this knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Methinks I saw, since more abundantly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In saying this I feel that I rejoice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One moment is more lethargy to me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2094" id="noteref-2094" epub:type="noteref">2094</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My mind in this wise wholly in suspense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And evermore with gazing grew enkindled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In presence of that light one such becomes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is impossible he e’er consent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the good, which object is of will,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2095" id="noteref-2095" epub:type="noteref">2095</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is gathered all in this, and out of it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is defective which is perfect there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shorter henceforward will my language fall</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what I yet remember, than an infant’s</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not because more than one unmingled semblance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was in the living light on which I looked,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is always what it was before;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But through the sight, that fortified itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In me by looking, one appearance only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me was ever changing as I changed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2096" id="noteref-2096" epub:type="noteref">2096</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within the deep and luminous subsistence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2097" id="noteref-2097" epub:type="noteref">2097</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the High Light appeared to me three circles,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2098" id="noteref-2098" epub:type="noteref">2098</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of threefold color and of one dimension,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And by the second seemed the first reflected</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As Iris is by Iris, and the third</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O how all speech is feeble and falls short</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my conceit, and this to what I saw</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is such, ’tis not enough to call it little!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That circulation, which being thus conceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared in thee as a reflected light,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2099" id="noteref-2099" epub:type="noteref">2099</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Within itself, of its own very color</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to me painted with our effigy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2100" id="noteref-2100" epub:type="noteref">2100</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As the geometrician, who endeavors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To square the circle, and discovers not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By taking thought, the principle he wants,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was I at that new apparition;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I wished to see how the image to the circle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Conformed itself, and how it there finds place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But my own wings were not enough for this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had it not been that then my mind there smote</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2101" id="noteref-2101" epub:type="noteref">2101</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here vigor failed the lofty fantasy:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But now was turning my desire and will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a wheel that equally is moved,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2102" id="noteref-2102" epub:type="noteref">2102</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Love which moves the sun and the other stars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-2103" id="noteref-2103" epub:type="noteref">2103</a></span>

					<span>I enter, and I see thee in the gloom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the long aisles, O poet saturnine!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And strive to make my steps keep pace with thine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The air is filled with some unknown perfume;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The congregation of the dead make room</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thee to pass; the votive tapers shine;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like rooks that haunt Ravenna’s groves of pine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hovering echoes fly from tomb to tomb.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the confessionals I hear arise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rehearsals of forgotten tragedies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And lamentations from the crypts below;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then a voice celestial that begins</span>

					<span>With snow-white veil and garments as of flame,</span>

					<span class="i1">She stands before thee, who so long ago</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Filled thy young heart with passion and the woe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From which thy song and all its splendors came;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while with stern rebuke she speaks thy name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ice about thy heart melts as the snow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On mountain heights, and in swift overflow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes gushing from thy lips in sobs of shame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou makest full confession; and a gleam,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of the dawn on some dark forest cast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seems on thy lifted forehead to increase;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lethe and Eunoë⁠—the remembered dream</span>
					<br/>

					<span>To run o’er better waters hoists its sail<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-531" id="noteref-531" epub:type="noteref">531</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The little vessel of my genius now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That leaves behind itself a sea so cruel;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of that second kingdom will I sing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein the human spirit doth purge itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to ascend to heaven becometh worthy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But let dead Poesy here rise again,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O holy Muses, since that I am yours,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And here Calliope somewhat ascend,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-532" id="noteref-532" epub:type="noteref">532</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My song accompanying with that sound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which the miserable magpies felt<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-533" id="noteref-533" epub:type="noteref">533</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sweet color of the oriental sapphire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the pure air, as far as the first circle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-534" id="noteref-534" epub:type="noteref">534</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto mine eyes did recommence delight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon as I issued forth from the dead air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beauteous planet, that to love incites,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-535" id="noteref-535" epub:type="noteref">535</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was making all the orient to laugh,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-536" id="noteref-536" epub:type="noteref">536</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the other pole, and saw four stars<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-537" id="noteref-537" epub:type="noteref">537</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ne’er seen before save by the primal people.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-538" id="noteref-538" epub:type="noteref">538</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O thou septentrional and widowed site,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because thou art deprived of seeing these!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from regarding them I had withdrawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning a little to the other pole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the Wain had disappeared already,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-539" id="noteref-539" epub:type="noteref">539</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw beside me an old man alone,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-540" id="noteref-540" epub:type="noteref">540</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Worthy of so much reverence in his look,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That more owes not to father any son.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A long beard and with white hair intermingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of which a double list fell on his breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The rays of the four consecrated stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did so adorn his countenance with light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That him I saw as were the sun before him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-541" id="noteref-541" epub:type="noteref">541</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have fled away from the eternal prison?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving those venerable plumes, he said:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-542" id="noteref-542" epub:type="noteref">542</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who guided you? or who has been your lamp</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In issuing forth out of the night profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever black makes the infernal valley?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or is there changed in heaven some counsel new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That being damned ye come unto my crags?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with his words, and with his hands and signs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Reverent he made in me my knees and brow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then answered him: “I came not of myself;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-543" id="noteref-543" epub:type="noteref">543</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I aided this one with my company.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since it is thy will more be unfolded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of our condition, how it truly is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one has never his last evening seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But by his folly was so near to it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That very little time was there to turn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I have said, I unto him was sent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rescue him, and other way was none</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than this to which I have myself betaken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ve shown him all the people of perdition,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now those spirits I intend to show</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How I have brought him would be long to tell thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As knoweth he who life for her refuses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou know’st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The vesture, that will shine so, the great day.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By us the eternal edicts are not broken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-544" id="noteref-544" epub:type="noteref">544</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of that circle I, where are the chaste<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-545" id="noteref-545" epub:type="noteref">545</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O holy breast, to hold her as thine own;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her love, then, incline thyself to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I will take back this grace from thee to her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While I was on the other side,” then said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“That every grace she wished of me I granted;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now that she dwells beyond the evil river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She can no longer move me, by that law</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, when I issued forth from there, was made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou dost say, no flattery is needful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go, then, and see thou gird this one about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-546" id="noteref-546" epub:type="noteref">546</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For ’twere not fitting that the eye o’ercast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By any mist should go before the first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Angel, who is of those of Paradise.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This little island round about its base</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No other plant that putteth forth the leaf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or that doth indurate, can there have life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter be not this way your return;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun, which now is rising, will direct you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To take the mount by easier ascent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With this he vanished; and I raised me up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a word, and wholly drew myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he began: “Son, follow thou my steps;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us turn back, for on this side declines</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plain unto its lower boundaries.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-547" id="noteref-547" epub:type="noteref">547</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which fled before it, so that from afar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I recognized the trembling of the sea.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the solitary plain we went</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who unto the lost road returns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And till he finds it seems to go in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as we were come to where the dew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fights with the sun, and, being in a part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where shadow falls, little evaporates,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-548" id="noteref-548" epub:type="noteref">548</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of his hands upon the grass outspread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In gentle manner did my Master place;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I, who of his action was aware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Extended unto him my tearful cheeks;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There did he make in me uncovered wholly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hue which Hell had covered up in me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then came we down upon the desert shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which never yet saw navigate its waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Any that afterward had known return.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There he begirt me as the other pleased;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O marvellous! for even as he culled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The humble plant, such it sprang up again<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-549" id="noteref-549" epub:type="noteref">549</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suddenly there where he uprooted it.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose circle of meridian covers o’er</span>

					<span class="i1">Jerusalem with its most lofty point,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And night that opposite to him revolves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the white and the vermilion cheeks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-551" id="noteref-551" epub:type="noteref">551</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of beautiful Aurora, where I was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By too great age were changing into orange.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We still were on the border of the sea,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like people who are thinking of their road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who go in heart, and with the body stay;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the gross vapors Mars grows fiery red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down in the West upon the ocean floor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeared to me⁠—may I again behold it!⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A light along the sea so swiftly coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From which when I a little had withdrawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again I saw it brighter grown and larger.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then on each side of it appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I knew not what of white, and underneath it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Little by little there came forth another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master yet had uttered not a word</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While the first whiteness into wings unfolded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when he clearly recognized the pilot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He cried: “Make haste, make haste to bow the knee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Henceforward shalt thou see such officers!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how he scorneth human arguments,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-552" id="noteref-552" epub:type="noteref">552</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than his own wings, between so distant shores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See how he holds them pointed up to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fanning the air with the eternal pinions,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then as still nearer and more near us came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that near by the eye could not endure him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But down I cast it; and he came to shore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a small vessel, very swift and light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the water swallowed naught thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beatitude seemed written in his face,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-553" id="noteref-553" epub:type="noteref">553</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more than a hundred spirits sat within.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">In exitu Israel de Ægypto!</i>”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They chanted all together in one voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With whatso in that psalm is after written.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then made he sign of holy rood upon them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he departed swiftly as he came.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The throng which still remained there unfamiliar</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who in new matters makes essay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On every side was darting forth the day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-554" id="noteref-554" epub:type="noteref">554</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When the new people lifted up their faces</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards us, saying to us: “If ye know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Show us the way to go unto the mountain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And answer made Virgilius: “Ye believe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance that we have knowledge of this place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But we are strangers even as yourselves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just now we came, a little while before you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another way, which was so rough and steep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Become aware that I was still alive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pallid in their astonishment became;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as to messenger who bears the olive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people throng to listen to the news,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And no one shows himself afraid of crowding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So at the sight of me stood motionless</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Oblivious to go and make them fair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One from among them saw I coming forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to embrace me, with such great affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it incited me to do the like.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O empty shadows, save in aspect only!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three times behind it did I clasp my hands,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-555" id="noteref-555" epub:type="noteref">555</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As oft returned with them to my own breast!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I think with wonder I depicted me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gently it said that I should stay my steps;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then knew I who it was, and I entreated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it would stop awhile to speak with me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It made reply to me: “Even as I loved thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In mortal body, so I love thee free;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“My own Casella! to return once more<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-556" id="noteref-556" epub:type="noteref">556</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where I am, I make this journey,” said I;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“But how from thee has so much time be taken?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “No outrage has been done me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he who takes both when and whom he pleases</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has many times denied to me this passage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For of a righteous will his own is made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-557" id="noteref-557" epub:type="noteref">557</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever wished to enter with all peace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-558" id="noteref-558" epub:type="noteref">558</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Benignantly by him have been received.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-559" id="noteref-559" epub:type="noteref">559</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because for evermore assemble there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those who tow’rds Acheron do not descend.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “If some new law take not from thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Memory or practice of the song of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which used to quiet in me all my longings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee may it please to comfort therewithal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hitherward coming is so much distressed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<em>Love, that within my mind discourses with me</em>,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forthwith began he so melodiously,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The melody within me still is sounding.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master, and myself, and all that people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with him were, appeared as satisfied</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if naught else might touch the mind of any.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We all of us were moveless and attentive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming: “What is this, ye laggard spirits?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What negligence, what standing still is this?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Run to the mountain to strip off the slough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That lets not God be manifest to you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as when, collecting grain or tares,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The doves, together at their pasture met,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If aught appear of which they are afraid,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon a sudden leave their food alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because they are assailed by greater care;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that fresh company did I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The song relinquish, and go tow’rds the hill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one who goes, and knows not whitherward;</span>

					<span>Nor was our own departure less in haste.</span>

				<p>
					<span>Inasmuch as the instantaneous flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had scattered them asunder o’er the plain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned to the mountain whither reason spurs us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I pressed me close unto my faithful comrade,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how without him had I kept my course?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who would have led me up along the mountain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He seemed to me within himself remorseful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O noble conscience, and without a stain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How sharp a sting is trivial fault to thee!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After his feet had laid aside the haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mars the dignity of every act,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mind, that hitherto had been restrained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Let loose its faculties as if delighted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I my sight directed to the hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That highest tow’rds the heaven uplifts itself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-560" id="noteref-560" epub:type="noteref">560</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The sun, that in our rear was flaming red,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was broken in front of me into the figure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which had in me the stoppage of its rays;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unto one side I turned me, with the fear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of being left alone, when I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only in front of me the ground obscured.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why dost thou still mistrust?” my Comforter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began to say to me turned wholly round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis evening there already where is buried</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The body within which I cast a shadow;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis from Brundusium ta’en, and Naples has it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-561" id="noteref-561" epub:type="noteref">561</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now if in front of me no shadow fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Marvel not at it more than at the heavens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because one ray impedeth not another</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To suffer torments, both of cold and heat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bodies like this that Power provides, which wills</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That how it works be not unveiled to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Insane is he who hopeth that our reason</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can traverse the illimitable way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the one Substance in three Persons follows!</span>

					<span>Mortals, remain contented at the <i xml:lang="la">Quia</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-562" id="noteref-562" epub:type="noteref">562</a></span>

					<span class="i1">For if ye had been able to see all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No need there were for Mary to give birth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ye have seen desiring without fruit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those whose desire would have been quieted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which evermore is given them for a grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I speak of Aristotle and of Plato,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And many others”;⁠—and here bowed his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more he said not, and remained disturbed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We came meanwhile unto the mountain’s foot;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There so precipitate we found the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nimble legs would there have been in vain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt Lerici and Turbìa, the most desert,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-563" id="noteref-563" epub:type="noteref">563</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The most secluded pathway is a stair</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Easy and open, if compared with that.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Slopes down,” my Master said, his footsteps staying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“So that who goeth without wings may mount?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And while he held his eyes upon the ground</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Examining the nature of the path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was looking up around the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the left hand appeared to me a throng</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And did not seem to move, they came so slowly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lift up thine eyes,” I to the Master said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou of thine own self can have it not.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he looked at me, and with frank expression</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied: “Let us go there, for they come slowly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still was that people as far off from us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-564" id="noteref-564" epub:type="noteref">564</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After a thousand steps of ours I say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As a good thrower with his hand would reach,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they all crowded unto the hard masses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he stands still to look who goes in doubt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O happy dead! O spirits elect already!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius made beginning, “by that peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I believe is waiting for you all,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the going up be possible,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For to lose time irks him most who most knows.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what the foremost does the others do,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-565" id="noteref-565" epub:type="noteref">565</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Huddling themselves against her, if she stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So moving to approach us thereupon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw the leader of that fortunate flock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Modest in face and dignified in gait.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as those in the advance saw broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The light upon the ground at my right side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that from me the shadow reached the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all the others, who came after them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Without your asking, I confess to you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is a human body which you see,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not without a power which comes from Heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Doth he endeavor to surmount this wall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Master thus; and said those worthy people:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Return ye then, and enter in before us,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Making a signal with the back o’ the hand</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them began: “Whoe’er thou art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If e’er thou saw me in the other world.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned me tow’rds him, and looked at him closely;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When with humility I had disclaimed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er having seen him, “Now behold!” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And showed me high upon his breast a wound.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said he with a smile: “I am Manfredi,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-566" id="noteref-566" epub:type="noteref">566</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The grandson of the Empress Costanza;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-567" id="noteref-567" epub:type="noteref">567</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-568" id="noteref-568" epub:type="noteref">568</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Sicily’s honor and of Aragon’s,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the truth tell her, if aught else be told.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After I had my body lacerated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Horrible my iniquities had been;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it receives whatever turns to it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had but Cosenza’s pastor, who in chase<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-569" id="noteref-569" epub:type="noteref">569</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of me was sent by Clement at that time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In God read understandingly this page,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bones of my dead body still would be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-570" id="noteref-570" epub:type="noteref">570</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he transported them with tapers quenched.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-571" id="noteref-571" epub:type="noteref">571</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>By malison of theirs is not so lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eternal Love, that it cannot return,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as hope has anything of green.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, who in contumacy dies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Holy Church, though penitent at last,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Must wait upon the outside this bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thirty times told the time that he has been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In his presumption, unless such decree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shorter by means of righteous prayers become.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See now if thou hast power to make me happy,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By making known unto my good Costanza</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For those on earth can much advance us here.”</span>

					<span>Whenever by delight or else by pain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seizes any faculty of ours,</span>

					<span class="i1">Wholly to that the soul collects itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It seemeth that no other power it heeds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this against that error is which thinks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One soul above another kindles in us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-572" id="noteref-572" epub:type="noteref">572</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Time passes on, and we perceive it not,</span>

					<span>Because one faculty is that which listens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And other that which the soul keeps entire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is as if in bonds, and that is free.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of this I had experience positive</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hearing and in gazing at that spirit;</span>

					<span class="i1">For fifty full degrees uprisen was<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-573" id="noteref-573" epub:type="noteref">573</a></span>

					<span>The sun, and I had not perceived it, when</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We came to where those souls with one accord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried out unto us: “Here is what you ask.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A greater opening ofttimes hedges up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With but a little forkful of his thorns</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The villager, what time the grape imbrowns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than was the passage-way through which ascended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only my Leader and myself behind him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After that company departed from us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-574" id="noteref-574" epub:type="noteref">574</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And mounts the summit of Bismantova,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With feet alone; but here one needs must fly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With the swift pinions and the plumes I say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of great desire, conducted after him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who gave me hope, and made a light for me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounted upward through the rifted rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on each side the border pressed upon us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And feet and hands the ground beneath required.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were come upon the upper rim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the high bank, out on the open slope,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My Master,” said I, “what way shall we take?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-575" id="noteref-575" epub:type="noteref">575</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “No step of thine descend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still up the mount behind me win thy way,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till some sage escort shall appear to us.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The summit was so high it vanquished sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the hillside precipitous far more</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than line from middle quadrant to the centre.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-576" id="noteref-576" epub:type="noteref">576</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Spent with fatigue was I, when I began:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How I remain alone, unless thou stay!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O son,” he said, “up yonder drag thyself,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which on that side encircles all the hill.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words of his so spurred me on, that I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the circle was beneath my feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon ourselves we seated both of us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned to the East, from which we had ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all men are delighted to look back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the low shores mine eyes I first directed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on the left hand we were smitten by it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Poet well perceived that I was wholly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bewildered at the chariot of the light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where ’twixt us and the Aquilon it entered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereon he said to me: “If Castor and Pollux<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-577" id="noteref-577" epub:type="noteref">577</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were in the company of yonder mirror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That up and down conducteth with its light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou wouldst behold the zodiac’s jagged wheel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-578" id="noteref-578" epub:type="noteref">578</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolving still more near unto the Bears,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless it swerved aside from its old track.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How that may be wouldst thou have power to think,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Collected in thyself, imagine Zion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together with this mount on earth to stand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that they both one sole horizon have,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-579" id="noteref-579" epub:type="noteref">579</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’lt see how of necessity must pass<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-580" id="noteref-580" epub:type="noteref">580</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This on one side, when that upon the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thine intelligence right clearly heed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Truly, my Master,” said I, “never yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw I so clearly as I now discern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where my wit appeared incompetent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the mid-circle of supernal motion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in some art is the Equator called,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aye remains between the Sun and Winter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-581" id="noteref-581" epub:type="noteref">581</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld it tow’rds the region of the heat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How far we have to go; for the hill rises</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “This mount is such, that ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At the beginning down below ’tis tiresome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That going up shall be to thee as easy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As going down the current in a boat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then at this pathway’s ending thou wilt be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There to repose thy panting breath expect;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more I answer; and this I know for true.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as he finished uttering these words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A voice close by us sounded: “Peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At sound thereof each one of us turned round,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw upon the left hand a great rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which neither I nor he before had noticed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither we drew; and there were persons there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who in the shadow stood behind the rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one through indolence is wont to stand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Holding his face low down between them bowed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my sweet Lord,” I said, “do turn thine eye<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-582" id="noteref-582" epub:type="noteref">582</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On him who shows himself more negligent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than even if Sloth herself his sister were.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said: “Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then knew I who he was; and the distress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still a little did my breathing quicken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My going to him hindered not; and after</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I came to him he hardly raised his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Hast thou seen clearly how the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His sluggish attitude and his curt words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little unto laughter moved my lips;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then I began: “Belacqua, I grieve not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-583" id="noteref-583" epub:type="noteref">583</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this place art thou? Waitest thou an escort?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “O brother, what’s the use of climbing?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since to my torment would not let me go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First heaven must needs so long revolve me round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outside thereof, as in my life it did,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since the good sighs I to the end postponed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unless, e’er that, some prayer may bring me aid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-584" id="noteref-584" epub:type="noteref">584</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which rises from a heart that lives in grace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What profit others that in heaven are heard not?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saying: “Come now; see the sun has touched</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Meridian, and from the shore the night</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Covers already with her foot Morocco.”</span>

				<p>
					<span>I had already from those shades departed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-585" id="noteref-585" epub:type="noteref">585</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And followed in the footsteps of my Guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When from behind, pointing his finger at me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One shouted: “See, it seems as if shone not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sunshine on the left of him below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And like one living seems he to conduct him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes I turned at utterance of these words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And saw them watching with astonishment</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But me, but me, and the light which was broken!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Why doth thy mind so occupy itself,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Master said, “that thou thy pace dost slacken?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What matters it to thee what here is whispered?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Come after me, and let the people talk;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its top for all the blowing of the winds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For evermore the man in whom is springing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the force of one the other weakens.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What could I say in answer but “I come”?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said it somewhat with that color tinged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Meanwhile along the mountain-side across</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came people in advance of us a little,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Singing the Miserere verse by verse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When they became aware I gave no place</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For passage of the sunshine through my body,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They changed their song into a long, hoarse “Oh!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And two of them, in form of messengers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Of your condition make us cognizant.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said my Master: “Ye can go your way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And carry back again to those who sent you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That this one’s body is of very flesh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If they stood still because they saw his shadow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I suppose, enough is answered them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Him let them honor, it may profit them.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Vapors enkindled saw I ne’er so swiftly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At early nightfall cleave the air serene,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-586" id="noteref-586" epub:type="noteref">586</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But upward they returned in briefer time,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, on arriving, with the others wheeled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tow’rds us, like troops that run without a rein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This folk that presses unto us is great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cometh to implore thee,” said the Poet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“So still go onward, and in going listen.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O soul that goest to beatitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the same members wherewith thou wast born,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouting they came, “a little stay thy steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Look, if thou e’er hast any of us seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that o’er yonder thou bear news of him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ah, why dost thou go on? Ah, why not stay?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Long since we all were slain by violence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sinners even to the latest hour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then did a light from heaven admonish us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From life we issued reconciled to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Although I gaze into your faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No one I recognize; but if may please you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, following the feet of such a Guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From world to world makes itself sought by me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And one began: “Each one has confidence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thy good offices without an oath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless the I cannot cut off the I will;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-587" id="noteref-587" epub:type="noteref">587</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I, who speak alone before the others,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-588" id="noteref-588" epub:type="noteref">588</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ’twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou be so courteous to me of thy prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may purge away my grave offences.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Issued the blood wherein I had my seat,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-589" id="noteref-589" epub:type="noteref">589</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-590" id="noteref-590" epub:type="noteref">590</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There where I thought to be the most secure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twas he of Este had it done, who held me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hatred far beyond what justice willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if towards the Mira I had fled,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-591" id="noteref-591" epub:type="noteref">591</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I was overtaken at Oriaco,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I still should be o’er yonder where men breathe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A lake made from my veins upon the ground.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said another: “Ah, be that desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou with pious pity aidest mine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-592" id="noteref-592" epub:type="noteref">592</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hence among these I go with downcast front.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “What violence or what chance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Led thee astray so far from Campaldino,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-594" id="noteref-594" epub:type="noteref">594</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never has thy sepulture been known?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Oh,” he replied, “at Casentino’s foot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A river crosses named Archiano, born</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above the Hermitage in Apennine.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-595" id="noteref-595" epub:type="noteref">595</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>There where the name thereof becometh void<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-596" id="noteref-596" epub:type="noteref">596</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There my sight lost I, and my utterance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">God’s Angel took me up, and he of hell<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-597" id="noteref-597" epub:type="noteref">597</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shouted: ‘O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou bearest away the eternal part of him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one poor little tear, that takes him from me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But with the rest I’ll deal in other fashion!’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-598" id="noteref-598" epub:type="noteref">598</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That humid vapor which to water turns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-599" id="noteref-599" epub:type="noteref">599</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To intellect, and moved the mist and wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of power, which his own nature gave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-600" id="noteref-600" epub:type="noteref">600</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With fog, and made the heaven above intent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that the pregnant air to water changed;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-601" id="noteref-601" epub:type="noteref">601</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whate’er of it earth tolerated not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as it mingled with the mighty torrents,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the royal river with such speed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My frozen body near unto its outlet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The robust Archian found, and into Arno</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-602" id="noteref-602" epub:type="noteref">602</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I made of me, when agony o’ercame me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then with its booty covered and begirt me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And rested thee from thy long journeying,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the second followed the third spirit,</span>

					<span class="i1">Because the fire of love fulfils at once</span>

					<span>Nothing whatever did it say to us,</span>

					<span>After the gracious and glad salutations</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had three and four times been reiterated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sordello backward drew and said, “Who are you?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Or ever to this mountain were directed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The souls deserving to ascend to God,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My bones were buried by Octavian.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-627" id="noteref-627" epub:type="noteref">627</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I am Virgilius; and for no crime else</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In this wise then my Leader made reply.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one who suddenly before him sees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Something whereat he marvels, who believes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And yet does not, saying, “It is! it is not!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with humility returned towards him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O glory of the Latians, thou,” he said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Through whom our language showed what it could do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O pride eternal of the place I came from,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What merit or what grace to me reveals thee?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Through all the circles of the doleful realm,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded he, “have I come hitherward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Heaven’s power impelled me, and with that I come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I by not doing, not by doing, lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sight of that high sun which thou desirest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And which too late by me was recognized.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A place there is below not sad with torments,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-628" id="noteref-628" epub:type="noteref">628</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But darkness only, where the lamentations</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwell I with the little innocents</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were from our human sinfulness exempt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There dwell I among those who the three saintly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-629" id="noteref-629" epub:type="noteref">629</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtues did not put on, and without vice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others knew and followed all of them.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-630" id="noteref-630" epub:type="noteref">630</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if thou know and can, some indication</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Give us by which we may the sooner come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Purgatory has its right beginning.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered: “No fixed place has been assigned us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis lawful for me to go up and round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far as I can go, as guide I join thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But see already how the day declines,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to go up by night we are not able;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-631" id="noteref-631" epub:type="noteref">631</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore ’tis well to think of some fair sojourn.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou permit me I will lead thee to them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt know them not without delight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How is this?” was the answer; “should one wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount by night would he prevented be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By others? or mayhap would not have power?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the ground the good Sordello drew</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His finger, saying, “See, this line alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not that aught else would hindrance give, however,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To going up, save the nocturnal darkness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This with the want of power the will perplexes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We might indeed therewith return below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That we can take delight in tarrying.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little had we withdrawn us from that place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I perceived the mount was hollowed out</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thitherward,” said that shade, “will we repair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there for the new day will we await.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-632" id="noteref-632" epub:type="noteref">632</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which led us to the margin of that dell,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where dies the border more than half away.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-633" id="noteref-633" epub:type="noteref">633</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Indian wood resplendent and serene,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fresh emerald the moment it is broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By herbage and by flowers within that hollow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Planted, each one in color would be vanquished,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As by its greater vanquished is the less.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor in that place had nature painted only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of the sweetness of a thousand odors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown.</span>

					<span class="i1">There seated, singing, spirits I beheld,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>“Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began the Mantuan who had led us thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Among them do not wish me to conduct you.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To heal the wounds that Italy have slain,</span>

					<span class="i1">So that through others slowly she revives.</span>

					<span class="i1">Governed the region where the water springs,</span>

					<span class="i1">I saw two Angels with two flaming swords,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-656" id="noteref-656" epub:type="noteref">656</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Truncated and deprived of their points.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-657" id="noteref-657" epub:type="noteref">657</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Green as the little leaflets just now born<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-658" id="noteref-658" epub:type="noteref">658</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One just above us came to take his station,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one descended to the opposite bank,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the people were contained between them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly in them discerned I the blond head;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But in their faces was the eye bewildered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As faculty confounded by excess.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“From Mary’s bosom both of them have come,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sordello said, “as guardians of the valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the serpent, that will come anon.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereupon I, who knew not by what road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round about, and closely drew myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And once again Sordello: “Now descend we</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only three steps I think that I descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And was below, and saw one who was looking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only at me, as if he fain would know me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already now the air was growing dark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But not so that between his eyes and mine<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-659" id="noteref-659" epub:type="noteref">659</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It did not show what it before locked up.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tow’rds me he moved, and I tow’rds him did move;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-660" id="noteref-660" epub:type="noteref">660</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld thee not among the damned!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No greeting fair was left unsaid between us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then asked he: “How long is it since thou camest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er the far waters to the mountain’s foot?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Oh!” said I to him, “through the dismal places</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I came this morn; and am in the first life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And on the instant my reply was heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He and Sordello both shrank back from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like people who are suddenly bewildered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One to Virgilius, and the other turned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To one who sat there, crying, “Up, Currado!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come and behold what God in grace has willed!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, turned to me: “By that especial grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His own first wherefore, that it has no ford,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thou shalt be beyond the waters wide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-661" id="noteref-661" epub:type="noteref">661</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where answer to the innocent is made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think her mother loves me more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since she has laid aside her wimple white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-662" id="noteref-662" epub:type="noteref">662</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Through her full easily is comprehended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How long in woman lasts the fire of love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If eye or touch do not relight it often.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So fair a hatchment will not make for her<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-663" id="noteref-663" epub:type="noteref">663</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Viper marshalling the Milanese<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-664" id="noteref-664" epub:type="noteref">664</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A-field, as would have made Gallura’s Cock.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-665" id="noteref-665" epub:type="noteref">665</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which measurably burneth in the heart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still to that point where slowest are the stars,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my Conductor: “Son, what dost thou gaze at</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up there?” And I to him: “At those three torches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-666" id="noteref-666" epub:type="noteref">666</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which this hither pole is all on fire.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The four resplendent stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And these have mounted up to where those were.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As he was speaking, to himself Sordello</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew him, and said, “Lo there our Adversary!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And pointed with his finger to look thither.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the side on which the little valley</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same which gave to Eve the bitter food.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-667" id="noteref-667" epub:type="noteref">667</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning at times its head about, and licking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not see, and therefore cannot say</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How the celestial falcons ’gan to move,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But well I saw that they were both in motion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to their stations flying back alike.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The shade that to the Judge had near approached</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he had called, throughout that whole assault</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“So may the light that leadeth thee on high</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Find in thine own free-will as much of wax</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As needful is up to the highest azure,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-668" id="noteref-668" epub:type="noteref">668</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Began it, “if some true intelligence</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’m not the elder, but from him descended;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mine I bore the love which here refineth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I unto him, “through your domains</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I never passed, but where is there a dwelling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Throughout all Europe, where they are not known?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That fame, which doeth honor to your house,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he knows of them who ne’er was there.</span>

					<span class="i1">Your honored family in naught abates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glory of the purse and of the sword.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “Now go; for the sun shall not lie</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-676" id="noteref-676" epub:type="noteref">676</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With gems her forehead all relucent was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Set in the shape of that cold animal<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-677" id="noteref-677" epub:type="noteref">677</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations,</span>

					<span>And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had taken two in that place where we were,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-678" id="noteref-678" epub:type="noteref">678</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the third was bending down its wings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I, who something had of Adam in me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-679" id="noteref-679" epub:type="noteref">679</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There were all five of us already sat.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-680" id="noteref-680" epub:type="noteref">680</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Just at the hour when her sad lay begins</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The little swallow, near unto the morning,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-681" id="noteref-681" epub:type="noteref">681</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance in memory of her former woes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when the mind of man, a wanderer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Almost prophetic in its visions is,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-682" id="noteref-682" epub:type="noteref">682</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With wings wide open, and intent to stoop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this, it seemed to me, was where had been<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-683" id="noteref-683" epub:type="noteref">683</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When to the high consistory he was rapt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I thought within myself, perchance he strikes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From habit only here, and from elsewhere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disdains to bear up any in his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Terrible as the lightning he descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And snatched me upward even to the fire.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-684" id="noteref-684" epub:type="noteref">684</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therein it seemed that he and I were burning,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the imagined fire did scorch me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of necessity my sleep was broken.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise Achilles started up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Around him turning his awakened eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And knowing not the place in which he was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time from Chiron stealthily his mother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-685" id="noteref-685" epub:type="noteref">685</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than I upstarted, when from off my face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sleep fled away; and pallid I became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As doth the man who freezes with affright.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Only my Comforter was at my side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now the sun was more than two hours high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned towards the sea-shore was my face.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Be not intimidated,” said my Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Be reassured, for all is well with us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See there the cliff that closes it around;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When inwardly thy spirit was asleep<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-686" id="noteref-686" epub:type="noteref">686</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the flowers that deck the land below,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There came a Lady and said: ‘I am Lucìa;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-687" id="noteref-687" epub:type="noteref">687</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let me take this one up, who is asleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So will I make his journey easier for him.’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sordello and the other noble shapes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-688" id="noteref-688" epub:type="noteref">688</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That open entrance pointed out to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then she and sleep together went away.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-689" id="noteref-689" epub:type="noteref">689</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In guise of one whose doubts are reassured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who to confidence his fear doth change,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the truth has been discovered to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did I change; and when without disquiet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Leader saw me, up along the cliff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He moved, and I behind him, tow’rd the height.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reader, thou seest well how I exalt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My theme, and therefore if with greater art</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I fortify it, marvel not thereat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nearer approached we, and were in such place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That there, where first appeared to me a rift</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a crevice that disparts a wall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diverse in color, to go up to it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as I opened more and more mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw him seated on the highest stair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such in the face that I endured it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in his hand he had a naked sword,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow’rds us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Tell it from where you are, what is’t you wish?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began he to exclaim; “where is the escort?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take heed your coming hither harm you not!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Master answered him, “but even now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said to us, ‘Thither go; there is the portal.’ ”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And may she speed your footsteps in all good,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Again began the courteous janitor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thither did we approach; and the first stair<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-690" id="noteref-690" epub:type="noteref">690</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was marble white, so polished and so smooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I mirrored myself therein as I appear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-691" id="noteref-691" epub:type="noteref">691</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of a calcined and uneven stone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The third, that uppermost rests massively,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As blood that from a vein is spirting forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Both of his feet was holding upon this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which seemed to me a stone of diamond.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-692" id="noteref-692" epub:type="noteref">692</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Along the three stairs upward with good will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did my Conductor draw me, saying: “Ask</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Humbly that he the fastening may undo.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For mercy’s sake besought that he would open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But first upon my breast three times I smote.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seven P’s upon my forehead he described<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-693" id="noteref-693" epub:type="noteref">693</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the sword’s point, and, “Take heed that thou wash</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These wounds, when thou shalt be within,” he said.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the same color were with his attire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from beneath it he drew forth two keys.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One was of gold, and the other was of silver;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-694" id="noteref-694" epub:type="noteref">694</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First with the white, and after with the yellow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Plied he the door, so that I was content.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Whenever faileth either of these keys</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it turn not rightly in the lock,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He said to us, “this entrance doth not open.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More precious one is, but the other needs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More art and intellect ere it unlock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For it is that which doth the knot unloose.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From Peter I have them; and he bade me err</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rather in opening than in keeping shut,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If people but fall down before my feet.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then pushed the portals of the sacred door,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaiming: “Enter; but I give you warning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That forth returns whoever looks behind.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-695" id="noteref-695" epub:type="noteref">695</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when upon their hinges were turned round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The swivels of that consecrated gate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which are of metal, massive and sonorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-696" id="noteref-696" epub:type="noteref">696</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tarpeia, when was ta’en from it the good</span>

					<br/>
					<span>At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And “<i xml:lang="la">Te Deum laudamus</i>” seemed to hear<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-698" id="noteref-698" epub:type="noteref">698</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In voices mingled with sweet melody.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Exactly such an image rendered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which I heard, as we are wont to catch,</span>

					<span class="i1">When people singing with the organ stand;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-699" id="noteref-699" epub:type="noteref">699</a></span>

					<span>When we had crossed the threshold of the door<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-700" id="noteref-700" epub:type="noteref">700</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the perverted love of souls disuses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because it makes the crooked way seem straight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Re-echoing I heard it closed again;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What for my failing had been fit excuse?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounted upward through a rifted rock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which undulated to this side and that,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a wave receding and advancing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Here it behoves us use a little art,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began my Leader, “to adapt ourselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now here, now there, to the receding side.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And this our footsteps so infrequent made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That sooner had the moon’s decreasing disk<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-701" id="noteref-701" epub:type="noteref">701</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regained its bed to sink again to rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than we were forth from out that needle’s eye;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when we free and in the open were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the mountain backward piles itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I wearied out, and both of us uncertain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">About our way, we stopped upon a plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More desolate than roads across the deserts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From where its margin borders on the void,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To foot of the high bank that ever rises,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A human body three times told would measure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And far as eye of mine could wing its flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now on the left, and on the right flank now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The same this cornice did appear to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I perceived the embankment round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which all right of ascent had interdicted,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-702" id="noteref-702" epub:type="noteref">702</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To be of marble white, and so adorned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sculptures, that not only Polycletus,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-703" id="noteref-703" epub:type="noteref">703</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But Nature’s self, had there been put to shame.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-704" id="noteref-704" epub:type="noteref">704</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of peace, that had been wept for many a year,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And opened Heaven from its long interdict,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In front of us appeared so truthfully</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There sculptured in a gracious attitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He did not seem an image that is silent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One would have sworn that he was saying, “Ave”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-705" id="noteref-705" epub:type="noteref">705</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For she was there in effigy portrayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who turned the key to ope the exalted love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in her mien this language had impressed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Ecce ancilla Dei</i>,” as distinctly<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-706" id="noteref-706" epub:type="noteref">706</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As any figure stamps itself in wax.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The gentle Master said, who had me standing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon that side where people have their hearts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In rear of Mary, and upon that side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where he was standing who conducted me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Another story on the rock imposed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that before mine eyes it might be set.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There sculptured in the self-same marble were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-707" id="noteref-707" epub:type="noteref">707</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>People appeared in front, and all of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In seven choirs divided, of two senses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made one say, “No,” the other, “Yes, they sing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were in the yes and no discordant made.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Preceded there the vessel benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-708" id="noteref-708" epub:type="noteref">708</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more and less than King was he in this.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Opposite, represented at the window</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-709" id="noteref-709" epub:type="noteref">709</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a woman scornful and afflicted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I moved my feet from where I had been standing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To examine near at hand another story,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which after Michal glimmered white upon me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-10-line-73">There the high glory of the Roman Prince<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-710" id="noteref-710" epub:type="noteref">710</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was chronicled, whose great beneficence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moved Gregory to his great victory;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-711" id="noteref-711" epub:type="noteref">711</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And a poor widow at his bridle stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In attitude of weeping and of grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around about him seemed it thronged and full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above them visibly in the wind were moving.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The wretched woman in the midst of these</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seemed to be saying: “Give me vengeance, Lord,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to answer her: “Now wait until</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I shall return.” And she: “My Lord,” like one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In whom grief is impatient, “shouldst thou not</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Return?” And he: “Who shall be where I am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Will give it thee.” And she: “Good deed of others</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he: “Now comfort thee, for it behoves me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I discharge my duty ere I move;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He who on no new thing has ever looked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was the creator of this visible language,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Novel to us, for here it is not found.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While I delighted me in contemplating</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The images of such humility,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dear to look on for their Maker’s sake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Behold, upon this side, but rare they make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their steps,” the Poet murmured, “many people;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">These will direct us to the lofty stairs.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To see new things, of which they curious are,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In turning round towards him were not slow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From thy good purposes, because thou hearest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How God ordaineth that the debt be paid;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Attend not to the fashion of the torment,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think of what follows; think that at the worst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” began I, “that which I behold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moving towards us seems to me not persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what I know not, so in sight I waver.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “The grievous quality</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of this their torment bows them so to earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That my own eyes at first contended with it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But look there fixedly, and disentangle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By sight what cometh underneath those stones;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already canst thou see how each is stricken.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, in the vision of the mind infirm,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confidence have in your backsliding steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Do ye not comprehend that we are worms,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-712" id="noteref-712" epub:type="noteref">712</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly</span>

					<span>Why floats aloft your spirit high in air?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-713" id="noteref-713" epub:type="noteref">713</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like are ye unto insects undeveloped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the worm in whom formation fails!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to sustain a ceiling or a roof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is seen to join its knees unto its breast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which makes of the unreal real anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Arise in him who sees it; fashioned thus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beheld I those, when I had ta’en good heed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True is it, they were more or less bent down,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According as they more or less were laden;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he who had most patience in his looks</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping did seem to say, “I can no more!”</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thus for themselves and us good furtherance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like unto that of which we sometimes dream,</span>

					<span class="i1">Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father;</span>

					<span>The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my progenitors so arrogant made me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, thinking not upon the common mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All men I held in scorn to such extent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I died therefor, as know the Sienese,</span>

					<span class="i1">And every child in Campagnatico.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin</span>

					<span class="i1">Has with it dragged into adversity.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till God be satisfied, since I did not</span>

					<span class="i1">Among the living, here among the dead.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Listening I downward bent my countenance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one of them, not this one who was speaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And looked at me, and knew me, and called out,</span>

					<span class="i1">Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On me, who all bowed down was going with them.</span>

					<span>Naught is this mundane rumor but a breath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of wind, that comes now this way and now that,</span>

					<span>Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter</span>

					<br/>
					<span>With him, who takes so little of the road<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-728" id="noteref-728" epub:type="noteref">728</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me, all Tuscany resounded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Where he was lord, what time was overthrown<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-729" id="noteref-729" epub:type="noteref">729</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Florentine delirium, that superb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was at that day as now ’tis prostitute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Your reputation is the color of grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which comes and goes, and that discolors it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which it issues green from out the earth.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Thy true speech fills my heart with good<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-730" id="noteref-730" epub:type="noteref">730</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Humility, and great tumor thou assuagest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That,” he replied, “is Provenzan Salvani,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-731" id="noteref-731" epub:type="noteref">731</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he is here because he had presumed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To bring Siena all into his hands.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He has gone thus, and goeth without rest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’er since he died; such money renders back</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In payment he who is on earth too daring.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “If every spirit who awaits</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The verge of life before that he repent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remains below there and ascends not hither,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until as much time as he lived be passed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How was the coming granted him in largess?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“When he in greatest splendor lived,” said he,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Freely upon the Campo of Siena,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All shame being laid aside, he placed himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there to draw his friend from the duress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered,</span>

					<span class="i1">Already showed how light of foot we were,</span>

					<span class="i1">In point of artifice, with figures covered</span>

					<span class="i1">Whate’er as pathway from the mount projects.</span>

					<span class="i1">More than all other creatures, down from heaven</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Celestial, lying on the other side,</span>

					<span class="i1">Still clad in armour round about their father,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if bewildered, looking at the people</span>

					<span class="i1">That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-751" id="noteref-751" epub:type="noteref">751</a></span>

					<span class="i1">“Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!”</span>

					<span class="i1">And likewise the remainder of that slaughter.</span>

					<span>Who e’er of pencil master was or stile,</span>

					<span>Now wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted,</span>

					<span class="i1">So that ye may behold your evil ways!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>More of the mount by us was now encompassed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And far more spent the circuit of the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than had the mind preoccupied imagined,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When he, who ever watchful in advance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was going on, began: “Lift up thy head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis no more time to go thus meditating.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo there an Angel who is making haste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To come towards us; lo, returning is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From service of the day the sixth handmaiden.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-755" id="noteref-755" epub:type="noteref">755</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>With reverence thine acts and looks adorn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he may delight to speed us upward;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Think that this day will never dawn again.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was familiar with his admonition</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ever to lose no time; so on this theme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He could not unto me speak covertly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards us came the being beautiful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested in white, and in his countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as appears the tremulous morning star.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His arms he opened, and opened then his wings;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Come,” said he, “near at hand here are the steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And easy from henceforth is the ascent.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At this announcement few are they who come!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O human creatures, born to soar aloft,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why fall ye thus before a little wind?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He led us on to where the rock was cleft;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There smote upon my forehead with his wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then a safe passage promised unto me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As on the right hand, to ascend the mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where seated is the church that lordeth it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er the well-guided, above Rubaconte,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-756" id="noteref-756" epub:type="noteref">756</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By stairways that were made there in the age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When still were safe the ledger and the stave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-757" id="noteref-757" epub:type="noteref">757</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en thus attempered is the bank which falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sheer downward from the second circle there;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on this side and that the high rock grazes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As we were turning thitherward our persons,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Beati pauperes spiritu</i>,” voices<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-758" id="noteref-758" epub:type="noteref">758</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ah me! how different are these entrances</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the Infernal! for with anthems here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One enters, and below with wild laments.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We now were mounting up the sacred stairs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And it appeared to me by far more easy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than on the plain it had appeared before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I: “My Master, say, what heavy thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He answered: “When the P’s which have remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still on thy face almost obliterate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That not alone they shall not feel fatigue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But urging up will be to them delight.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then did I even as they do who are going</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With something on the head to them unknown,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless the signs of others make them doubt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which cannot be accomplished by the sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with the fingers of the right hand spread</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I found but six the letters, that had carved</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon my temples he who bore the keys;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon beholding which my Leader smiled.</span>

					<span>We were upon the summit of the stairs,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-759" id="noteref-759" epub:type="noteref">759</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Where for the second time is cut away</span>

					<br/>
					<span>There in like manner doth a cornice bind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hill all round about, as does the first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that its arc more suddenly is curved.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With but the livid color of the stone.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-760" id="noteref-760" epub:type="noteref">760</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If to inquire we wait for people here,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Poet said, “I fear that peradventure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too much delay will our election have.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made his right side the centre of his motion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-761" id="noteref-761" epub:type="noteref">761</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turned the left part of himself about.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-762" id="noteref-762" epub:type="noteref">762</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said he, “as one within here should be led.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If other reason prompt not otherwise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As much as here is counted for a mile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much already there had we advanced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In little time, by dint of ready will;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And tow’rds us there were heard to fly, albeit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They were not visible, spirits uttering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto Love’s table courteous invitations,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first voice that passed onward in its flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Vinum non habent</i>,” said in accents loud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-763" id="noteref-763" epub:type="noteref">763</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And went reiterating it behind us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere it wholly grew inaudible</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of distance, passed another, crying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“I am Orestes!” and it also stayed not.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-764" id="noteref-764" epub:type="noteref">764</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O,” said I, “Father, these, what voices are they?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And even as I asked, behold the third,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Love those from whom ye have had evil!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-765" id="noteref-765" epub:type="noteref">765</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the good Master said: “This circle scourges</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sin of envy, and on that account</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-766" id="noteref-766" epub:type="noteref">766</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The bridle of another sound shall be;</span>

					<span class="i1">I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge,</span>

					<span>But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And people thou wilt see before us sitting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each one close against the cliff is seated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not from the color of the stone diverse.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when we were a little farther onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I heard a cry of, “Mary, pray for us!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cry of, “Michael, Peter, and all Saints!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-768" id="noteref-768" epub:type="noteref">768</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think there walketh still on earth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A man so hard, that he would not be pierced</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With pity at what afterward I saw.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For when I had approached so near to them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That manifest to me their acts became,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one sustained the other with his shoulder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And all of them were by the bank sustained.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stand at the doors of churches asking alms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one upon another leans his head,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that in others pity soon may rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not only at the accent of their words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But at their aspect, which no less implores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as unto the blind the sun comes not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So to the shades, of whom just now I spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Heaven’s light will not be bounteous of itself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For all their lids an iron wire transpierces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is done, because it will not quiet stay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing the others without being seen;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Well knew he what the mute one wished to say,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And therefore waited not for my demand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But said: “Speak, and be brief, and to the point.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I had Virgilius upon that side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the embankment from which one may fall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since by no border ’tis engarlanded;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the other side of me I had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The shades devout, who through the horrible seam</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To them I turned me, and, “O people, certain,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I, “of beholding the high light,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which your desire has solely in its care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So may grace speedily dissolve the scum</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon your consciences, that limpidly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through them descend the river of the mind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me, for dear ’twill be to me and gracious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If any soul among you here is Latian,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-769" id="noteref-769" epub:type="noteref">769</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ’twill perchance be good for him I learn it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O brother mine, each one is citizen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one true city; but thy meaning is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By way of answer this I seemed to hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A little farther on than where I stood,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat I made myself still nearer heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Among the rest I saw a shade that waited</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In aspect, and should anyone ask how,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Spirit,” I said, “who stoopest to ascend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou art he who did reply to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make thyself known to me by place or name.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Sienese was I,” it replied, “and with</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others here recleanse my guilty life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weeping to Him to lend himself to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sapient I was not, although I Sapia<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-770" id="noteref-770" epub:type="noteref">770</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was called, and I was at another’s harm<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-771" id="noteref-771" epub:type="noteref">771</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More happy far than at my own good fortune.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The arc already of my years descending,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-772" id="noteref-772" epub:type="noteref">772</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My fellow-citizens near unto Colle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were joined in battle with their adversaries,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was praying God for what he willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Routed were they, and turned into the bitter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A joy received unequalled by all others;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that I lifted upward my bold face</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Crying to God, ‘Henceforth I fear thee not,’<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-773" id="noteref-773" epub:type="noteref">773</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As did the blackbird at the little sunshine.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peace I desired with God at the extreme</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my existence, and as yet would not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My debt have been by penitence discharged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had it not been that in remembrance held me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-774" id="noteref-774" epub:type="noteref">774</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who out of charity was grieved for me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But who art thou, that into our conditions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mine eyes,” I said, “will yet be here ta’en from me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But for short space; for small is the offence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Committed by their being turned with envy.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul is, of the torment underneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For even now the load down there weighs on me.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-775" id="noteref-775" epub:type="noteref">775</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she to me: “Who led thee, then, among us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I: “He who is with me, and speaks not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And living am I; therefore ask of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move</span>

					<span class="i1">O’er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-776" id="noteref-776" epub:type="noteref">776</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O, this is such a novel thing to hear,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She answered, “that great sign it is God loves thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I implore, by what thou most desirest,</span>

					<span class="i1">More hope than in discovering the Diana;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-779" id="noteref-779" epub:type="noteref">779</a></span>

					<span>“Who is this one that goes about our mountain,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-781" id="noteref-781" epub:type="noteref">781</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever Death has given him power of flight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I know not who, but know he’s not alone;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did two spirits, leaning tow’rds each other,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-782" id="noteref-782" epub:type="noteref">782</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discourse about me there on the right hand;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then held supine their faces to address me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the one: “O soul, that, fastened still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within the body, tow’rds the heaven art going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For charity console us, and declare</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak’st us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much to marvel at this grace of thine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As must a thing that never yet has been.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “Through midst of Tuscany there wanders</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A streamlet that is born in Falterona,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-783" id="noteref-783" epub:type="noteref">783</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not a hundred miles of course suffice it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From thereupon do I this body bring.</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To tell you who I am were speech in vain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because my name as yet makes no great noise.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If well thy meaning I can penetrate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With intellect of mine,” then answered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He who first spake, “thou speakest of the Arno.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said the other to him: “Why concealed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This one the appellation of that river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a man doth of things horrible?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thus the shade that questioned was of this</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself acquitted: “I know not; but truly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis fit the name of such a valley perish;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant</span>

					<span class="i1">The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-784" id="noteref-784" epub:type="noteref">784</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in few places it that mark surpasses)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To where it yields itself in restoration</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence have the rivers that which goes with them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Virtue is like an enemy avoided</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of place, or through bad habit that impels them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On which account have so transformed their nature<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-785" id="noteref-785" epub:type="noteref">785</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dwellers in that miserable valley,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seems that Circe had them in her pasture.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>’Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-786" id="noteref-786" epub:type="noteref">786</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Than other food for human use created,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It first directeth its impoverished way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-787" id="noteref-787" epub:type="noteref">787</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More snarling than their puissance demands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It goes on falling, and the more it grows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-788" id="noteref-788" epub:type="noteref">788</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This maledict and misadventurous ditch.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Descended then through many a hollow gulf,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It finds the foxes so replete with fraud,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-789" id="noteref-789" epub:type="noteref">789</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They fear no cunning that may master them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor will I cease because another hears me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And well ’twill be for him, if still he mind him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-790" id="noteref-790" epub:type="noteref">790</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy grandson I behold, who doth become<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-791" id="noteref-791" epub:type="noteref">791</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hunter of those wolves upon the bank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He sells their flesh, it being yet alive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Many of life, himself of praise, deprives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-792" id="noteref-792" epub:type="noteref">792</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He leaves it such, a thousand years from now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In its primeval state ’tis not re-wooded.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As at the announcement of impending ills</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The face of him who listens is disturbed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From whate’er side the peril seize upon him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I beheld that other soul, which stood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When it had gathered to itself the word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The speech of one and aspect of the other</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had me desirous made to know their names,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And question mixed with prayers I made thereof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat the spirit which first spake to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began again: “Thou wishest I should bring me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To do for thee what thou’lt not do for me;</span>

					<span>But since God willeth that in thee shine forth</span>

					<span class="i1">Such grace of his, I’ll not be chary with thee;</span>

					<br/>
					<span>My blood was so with envy set on fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That if I had beheld a man make merry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o’er with pallor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From my own sowing such the straw I reap!</span>

					<span class="i1">If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as hearing had a truce from this,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold another, with so great a crash,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That it resembled thunderings following fast:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-812" id="noteref-812" epub:type="noteref">812</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And then, to press myself close to the Poet,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I backward, and not forward, took a step.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already on all sides the air was quiet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said he to me: “That was the hard curb</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ought to hold a man within his bounds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But you take in the bait so that the hook</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the old Adversary draws you to him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="purgatorio-canto-14-line-147">And hence availeth little curb or call.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-813" id="noteref-813" epub:type="noteref">813</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-14-line-148">The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-814" id="noteref-814" epub:type="noteref">814</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Displaying to you their eternal beauties,</span>

					<span class="i1">And still your eye is looking on the ground;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-815" id="noteref-815" epub:type="noteref">815</a></span>

				<p>
					<span>As much as ’twixt the close of the third hour<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-816" id="noteref-816" epub:type="noteref">816</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which aye in fashion of a child is playing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much it now appeared, towards the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was of his course remaining to the sun;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There it was evening, and ’twas midnight here;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the rays smote the middle of our faces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because by us the mount was so encircled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That straight towards the west we now were going;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I perceived my forehead overpowered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beneath the splendor far more than at first,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And stupor were to me the things unknown;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat towards the summit of my brow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I raised my hands, and made myself the visor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the excessive glare diminishes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As when from off the water, or a mirror,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ascending upward in the selfsame measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That it descends, and deviates as far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From falling of a stone in line direct,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-817" id="noteref-817" epub:type="noteref">817</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(As demonstrate experiment and art,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So it appeared to me that by a light</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Refracted there before me I was smitten;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On which account my sight was swift to flee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So fully screen my sight that it avail me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said I, “and seems towards us to be moving?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The family of heaven,” he answered me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“An angel ’tis, who comes to invite us upward.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon will it be, that to behold these things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we had reached the Angel benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With joyful voice he said: “Here enter in</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To stairway far less steep than are the others.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We mounting were, already thence departed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And “<i xml:lang="la">Beati misericordes</i>” was<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-818" id="noteref-818" epub:type="noteref">818</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us sung, “Rejoice, thou that o’ercomest!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-819" id="noteref-819" epub:type="noteref">819</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Master and myself, we two alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were going upward, and I thought, in going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some profit to acquire from words of his;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him directed me, thus asking:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What did the spirit of Romagna mean,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1" id="purgatorio-canto-15-line-45">Mentioning interdict and partnership?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence he to me: “Of his own greatest failing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he reprove us, that we less may rue it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because are thither pointed your desires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where by companionship each share is lessened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the love of the supernal sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should upwardly direct your aspiration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There would not be that fear within your breast;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there, as much the more as one says <em>Our</em>,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-820" id="noteref-820" epub:type="noteref">820</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much the more of good each one possesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more of charity in that cloister burns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am more hungering to be satisfied,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said, “than if I had before been silent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And more of doubt within my mind I gather.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How can it be, that boon distributed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more possessors can more wealthy make</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therein, than if by few it be possessed?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Because thou fixest still</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mind entirely upon earthly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou pluckest darkness from the very light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That goodness infinite and ineffable<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-821" id="noteref-821" epub:type="noteref">821</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is above there, runneth unto love,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much it gives itself as it finds ardor,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-822" id="noteref-822" epub:type="noteref">822</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that as far as charity extends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’er it increases the eternal valor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the more people thitherward aspire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More are there to love well, and more they love there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, as a mirror, one reflects the other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if my reasoning appease thee not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take from thee this and every other longing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As are the two already, the five wounds</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That close themselves again by being painful.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as I wished to say, “Thou dost appease me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw that I had reached another circle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that my eager eyes made me keep silence.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There it appeared to me that in a vision</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in a temple many persons saw;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And at the door a woman, with the sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behavior of a mother, saying: “Son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-823" id="noteref-823" epub:type="noteref">823</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were seeking for thee”;⁠—and as here she ceased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which appeared at first had disappeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I beheld another with those waters</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From great disdain of others it is born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saying: “If of that city thou art lord,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-824" id="noteref-824" epub:type="noteref">824</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For whose name was such strife among the gods,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And whence doth every science scintillate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Avenge thyself on those audacious arms</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-825" id="noteref-825" epub:type="noteref">825</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the lord seemed to me benign and mild</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To answer her with aspect temperate:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“What shall we do to those who wish us ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If he who loves us be by us condemned?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-826" id="noteref-826" epub:type="noteref">826</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With stones a young man slaying, clamorously</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still crying to each other, “Kill him! kill him!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And him I saw bow down, because of death</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That weighed already on him, to the earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he would pardon those his persecutors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such an aspect as unlocks compassion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as my soul had outwardly returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To things external to it which are true,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did I my not false errors recognize.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-827" id="noteref-827" epub:type="noteref">827</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Leader, who could see me bear myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a man that rouses him from sleep,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Exclaimed: “What ails thee, that thou canst not stand?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But hast been coming more than half a league</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I’ll tell thee,” said I, “what appeared to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When thus from me my legs were ta’en away.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “If thou shouldst have a hundred masks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon thy face, from me would not be shut</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy cogitations, howsoever small.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from the eternal fountain are diffused.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I did not ask, ‘What ails thee?’ as he does</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who only looketh with the eyes that see not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When of the soul bereft the body lies,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But asked it to give vigor to thy feet;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To use their wakefulness when it returns.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We passed along, athwart the twilight peering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forward as far as ever eye could stretch</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In our direction, sombre as the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor was there place to hide one’s self therefrom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us.</span>

					<span>Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-828" id="noteref-828" epub:type="noteref">828</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of every planet under a poor sky,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-829" id="noteref-829" epub:type="noteref">829</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as may be tenebrous with cloud,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ne’er made unto my sight so thick a veil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As did that smoke which there enveloped us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For not an eye it suffered to stay open;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as a blind man goes behind his guide,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lest he should wander, or should strike against</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So went I through the bitter and foul air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Listening unto my Leader, who said only,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Look that from me thou be not separated.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Voices I heard, and everyone appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To supplicate for peace and misericord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Lamb of God who takes away our sins.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Still “<i xml:lang="la">Agnus Dei</i>” their exordium was;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-830" id="noteref-830" epub:type="noteref">830</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One word there was in all, and metre one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that all harmony appeared among them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Master,” I said, “are spirits those I hear?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he to me: “Thou apprehendest truly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they the knot of anger go unloosing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And art discoursing of us even as though</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou didst by calends still divide the time?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-831" id="noteref-831" epub:type="noteref">831</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After this manner by a voice was spoken;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereon my Master said: “Do thou reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ask if on this side the way go upward.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “O creature that dost cleanse thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To return beautiful to Him who made thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered; “and if smoke prevent our seeing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon began I: “With that swathing band</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which death unwindeth am I going upward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And hither came I through the infernal anguish.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if God in his grace has me infolded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he wills that I behold his court</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By method wholly out of modern usage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But tell it me, and tell me if I go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Lombard was I, and I was Marco called;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-832" id="noteref-832" epub:type="noteref">832</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The world I knew, and loved that excellence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which has each one now unbent his bow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For mounting upward, thou art going right.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus he made answer, and subjoined: “I pray thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To pray for me when thou shalt be above.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “My faith I pledge to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First it was simple, and is now made double</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By thy opinion, which makes certain to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-833" id="noteref-833" epub:type="noteref">833</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The world forsooth is utterly deserted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By every virtue, as thou tellest me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with iniquity is big and covered;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But I beseech thee point me out the cause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I may see it, and to others show it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-834" id="noteref-834" epub:type="noteref">834</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He first sent forth, and then began he: “Brother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ye who are living every cause refer<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-835" id="noteref-835" epub:type="noteref">835</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still upward to the heavens, as if all things</span>

					<span class="i1" id="purgatorio-canto-16-line-69">They of necessity moved with themselves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-836" id="noteref-836" epub:type="noteref">836</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Free will, nor any justice would there be</span>

					<span class="i1">In having joy for good, or grief for evil.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The heavens your movements do initiate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say not all; but granting that I say it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light has been given you for good and evil,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And free volition; which, if some fatigue</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the first battles with the heavens it suffers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Afterwards conquers all, if well ’tis nurtured.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-838" id="noteref-838" epub:type="noteref">838</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>To greater force and to a better nature,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-839" id="noteref-839" epub:type="noteref">839</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Though free, ye subject are, and that creates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mind in you the heavens have not in charge.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence, if the present world doth go astray,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In you the cause is, be it sought in you;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I therein will now be thy true spy.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-840" id="noteref-840" epub:type="noteref">840</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it</span>

					<span class="i1">Before it is, like to a little girl</span>

					<span>Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of trivial good at first it tastes the savor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is cheated by it, and runs after it,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-841" id="noteref-841" epub:type="noteref">841</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If guide or rein turn not aside its love.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behoved a king to have, who at the least</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the true city should discern the tower.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-842" id="noteref-842" epub:type="noteref">842</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The laws exist, but who sets hand to them?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No one; because the shepherd who precedes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-843" id="noteref-843" epub:type="noteref">843</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Wherefore the people that perceives its guide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Strike only at the good for which it hankers,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-844" id="noteref-844" epub:type="noteref">844</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The cause is that has made the world depraved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And not that nature is corrupt in you.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two suns to have, which one road and the other,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-845" id="noteref-845" epub:type="noteref">845</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of God and of the world, made manifest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One has the other quenched, and to the crosier</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That by main force one with the other go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because, being joined, one feareth not the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou believe not, think upon the grain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by its seed each herb is recognized.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the land laved by Po and Adige,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-846" id="noteref-846" epub:type="noteref">846</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Valor and courtesy used to be found,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before that Frederick had his controversy;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-847" id="noteref-847" epub:type="noteref">847</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now in security can pass that way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From speaking with the good, or drawing near them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The ancient age the new, and late they deem it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That God restore them to the better life:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-848" id="noteref-848" epub:type="noteref">848</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Guido da Castel, who better named is,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Confounding in itself two governments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O Marco mine,” I said, “thou reasonest well;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now discern I why the sons of Levi</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Have been excluded from the heritage.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-849" id="noteref-849" epub:type="noteref">849</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In reprobation of the barbarous age?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered me; “for speaking Tuscan to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By other surname do I know him not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-850" id="noteref-850" epub:type="noteref">850</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May God be with you, for I come no farther.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already whitening; and I must depart⁠—</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mist o’ertook thee, through which thou couldst see<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-852" id="noteref-852" epub:type="noteref">852</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not otherwise than through its membrane mole,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How, when the vapors humid and condensed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the sun feebly enters in among them,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In coming to perceive how I re-saw</span>

					<br/>
					<span>Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To rays already dead on the low shores.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So from without sometimes, that man perceives not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although around may sound a thousand trumpets,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By self, or by a will that downward guides it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of her impiety, who changed her form<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-853" id="noteref-853" epub:type="noteref">853</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the bird that most delights in singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In my imagining appeared the trace;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within itself, that from without there came</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nothing that then might be received by it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then rained within my lofty fantasy<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-854" id="noteref-854" epub:type="noteref">854</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One crucified, disdainful and ferocious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In countenance, and even thus was dying.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Around him were the great Ahasuerus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who was in word and action so entire.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as this image burst asunder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which the water it was made of fails,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There rose up in my vision a young maiden<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-855" id="noteref-855" epub:type="noteref">855</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bitterly weeping, and she said: “O queen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou’st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mother, at thine ere at another’s ruin.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And broken quivers e’er it dieth wholly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So this imagining of mine fell down</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as the effulgence smote my face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Greater by far than what is in our wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned me round to see where I might be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When said a voice, “Here is the passage up”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from all other purposes removed me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And made my wish so full of eagerness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To look and see who was it that was speaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It never rests till meeting face to face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as before the sun, which quells the sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in its own excess its figure veils,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-856" id="noteref-856" epub:type="noteref">856</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even so my power was insufficient here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“This is a spirit divine, who in the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of going up directs us without asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And who with his own light himself conceals.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He does with us as man doth with himself;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he who sees the need, and waits the asking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Malignly leans already tow’rds denial.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Accord we now our feet to such inviting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For then we could not till the day return.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus my Conductor said; and I and he</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together turned our footsteps to a stairway;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I, as soon as the first step I reached,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Near me perceived a motion as of wings,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fanning in the face, and saying, “<i xml:lang="la">Beati</i><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-857" id="noteref-857" epub:type="noteref">857</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><i xml:lang="la">Pacifici</i>, who are without ill anger.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already over us were so uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That upon many sides the stars appeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I said within myself; for I perceived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The vigor of my legs was put in truce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We at the point were where no more ascends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The stairway upward, and were motionless,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I gave heed a little, if I might hear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aught whatsoever in the circle new;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then to my Master turned me round and said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is purged here in the circle where we are?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-17-line-85">And he to me: “The love of good, remiss<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-858" id="noteref-858" epub:type="noteref">858</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In what it should have done, is here restored;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here plied again the ill-belated oar;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still more openly to understand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some profitable fruit from our delay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-17-line-91">Neither Creator nor a creature ever,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Son,” he began, “was destitute of love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The natural was ever without error;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But err the other may by evil object,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or by too much, or by too little vigor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While in the first it well directed is,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-859" id="noteref-859" epub:type="noteref">859</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the second moderates itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when to ill it turns, and, with more care</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or lesser than it ought, runs after good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Gainst the Creator works his own creation.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The seed within yourselves of every virtue,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And every act that merits punishment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now inasmuch as never from the welfare</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of its own subject can love turn its sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From their own hatred all things are secure;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And since we cannot think of any being</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Standing alone, nor from the First divided,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of hating Him is all desire cut off.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence if, discriminating, I judge well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The evil that one loves is of one’s neighbor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this is born in three modes in your clay.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are, who, by abasement of their neighbor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hope to excel, and therefore only long</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from his greatness he may be cast down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There are, who power, grace, honor, and renown</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fear they may lose because another rises,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence are so sad that the reverse they love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there are those whom injury seems to chafe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it makes them greedy for revenge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And such must needs shape out another’s harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This threefold love is wept for down below;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-860" id="noteref-860" epub:type="noteref">860</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now of the other will I have thee hear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That runneth after good with measure faulty.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each one confusedly a good conceives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefore to overtake it each one strives.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If languid love to look on this attract you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or in attaining unto it, this cornice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After just penitence, torments you for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There’s other good that does not make man happy;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis not felicity, ’tis not the good</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Essence, of every good the fruit and root.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The love that yields itself too much to this<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-861" id="noteref-861" epub:type="noteref">861</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above us is lamented in three circles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But how tripartite it may be described,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.”</span>

					<span>Therefore I thee entreat, sweet Father dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To teach me love, to which thou dost refer</span>

					<span class="i1">The error of the blind, who would be leaders.</span>

					<span>And if, when turned, towards it she incline,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love is that inclination; it is nature,</span>
					<br/>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which is a motion spiritual, and ne’er rests</span>

					<span class="i1">Until she doth enjoy the thing beloved.</span>

					<br/>

					<span class="i1">Innate within you is the power that counsels,</span>

					<span class="i1">Had laid aside the burden of my lading;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-874" id="noteref-874" epub:type="noteref">874</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I, who reason manifest and plain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In answer to my questions had received,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stood like a man in drowsy reverie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But taken from me was this drowsiness</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suddenly by a people, that behind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our backs already had come round to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-875" id="noteref-875" epub:type="noteref">875</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beside them saw at night the rush and throng,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So they along that circle curve their step,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-876" id="noteref-876" epub:type="noteref">876</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From what I saw of those approaching us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Full soon they were upon us, because running</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Moved onward all that mighty multitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And two in the advance cried out, lamenting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Mary in haste unto the mountain ran,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-877" id="noteref-877" epub:type="noteref">877</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-878" id="noteref-878" epub:type="noteref">878</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By little love!” forthwith the others cried,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“For ardor in well-doing freshens grace!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O folk, in whom an eager fervor now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Supplies perhaps delay and negligence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one who lives, and truly I lie not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would fain go up, if but the sun relight us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So tell us where the passage nearest is.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These were the words of him who was my Guide;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And someone of those spirits said: “Come on</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So full of longing are we to move onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If thou for churlishness our justice take.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was San Zeno’s Abbot at Verona,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-879" id="noteref-879" epub:type="noteref">879</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Under the empire of good Barbarossa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-880" id="noteref-880" epub:type="noteref">880</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he has one foot in the grave already,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-881" id="noteref-881" epub:type="noteref">881</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who shall erelong lament that monastery,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And sorry be of having there had power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because his son, in his whole body sick,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And worse in mind, and who was evil-born,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He put into the place of its true pastor.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If more he said, or silent was, I know not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He had already passed so far beyond us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who was in every need my succor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Turn thee hitherward; see two of them</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-882" id="noteref-882" epub:type="noteref">882</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rear of all they shouted: “Sooner were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The people dead to whom the sea was opened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than their inheritors the Jordan saw;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-883" id="noteref-883" epub:type="noteref">883</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those who the fatigue did not endure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the issue, with Anchises’ son,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-884" id="noteref-884" epub:type="noteref">884</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Themselves to life withouten glory offered.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then when from us so separated were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those shades, that they no longer could be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within me a new thought did entrance find,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence others many and diverse were born;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so I lapsed from one into another,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in a reverie mine eyes I closed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And meditation into dream transmuted.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-885" id="noteref-885" epub:type="noteref">885</a></span>

					<span>It was the hour when the diurnal heat<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-886" id="noteref-886" epub:type="noteref">886</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No more can warm the coldness of the moon,</span>

					<span>There came to me in dreams a stammering woman,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-890" id="noteref-890" epub:type="noteref">890</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With hands dissevered and of sallow hue.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I looked at her; and as the sun restores</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The frigid members which the night benumbs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even thus my gaze did render voluble</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In little while, and the lost countenance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As love desires it so in her did color.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in this wise she had her speech unloosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She ’gan to sing so, that with difficulty</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could I have turned my thoughts away from her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“I am,” she sang, “I am the Siren sweet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who mariners amid the main unman,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So full am I of pleasantness to hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I drew Ulysses from his wandering way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my song, and he who dwells with me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seldom departs so wholly I content him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Her mouth was not yet closed again, before</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared a Lady saintly and alert</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Close at my side to put her to confusion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sternly she said; and he was drawing near</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With eyes still fixed upon that modest one.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She seized the other and in front laid open,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Rending her garments, and her belly showed me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This waked me with the stench that issued from it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I rose; and full already of high day</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the new sun at our back we went.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Following behind him, I my forehead bore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like unto one who has it laden with thought,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I heard say, “Come, here the passage is,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spoken in a manner gentle and benign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as we hear not in this mortal region.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With open wings, which of a swan appeared,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upward he turned us who thus spake to us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the two walls of the solid granite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Affirming those <i xml:lang="la">qui lugent</i> to be blessed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For they shall have their souls with comfort filled.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-891" id="noteref-891" epub:type="noteref">891</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To me my Guide began to say, we both</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “With such misgiving makes me go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A vision new, which bends me to itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Didst thou behold,” he said, “that old enchantress,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who sole above us henceforth is lamented?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-892" id="noteref-892" epub:type="noteref">892</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Didst thou behold how man is freed from her?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-893" id="noteref-893" epub:type="noteref">893</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Eternal King with revolutions vast.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then turns him to the call and stretches forward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through the desire of food that draws him thither,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rock to give a way to him who mounts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went on to where the circling doth begin.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the fifth circle when I had come forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">People I saw upon it who were weeping,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Adhæsit pavimento anima mea</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-894" id="noteref-894" epub:type="noteref">894</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I heard them say with sighings so profound,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hardly could the words be understood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O ye elect of God, whose sufferings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice and Hope both render less severe,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct ye us towards the high ascents.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If ye are come secure from this prostration,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And wish to find the way most speedily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Let your right hands be evermore outside.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By them somewhat in front of us; whence I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In what was spoken divined the rest concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And unto my Lord’s eyes mine eyes I turned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he assented with a cheerful sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To what the sight of my desire implored.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When of myself I could dispose at will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above that creature did I draw myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whose words before had caused me to take note,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying: “O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That without which to God we cannot turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suspend awhile for me thy greater care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Anything there whence living I departed.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Wherefore our backs the heaven</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">

					<span>Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A river beautiful, and of its name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The title of my blood its summit makes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A month and little more essayed I how</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all the other burdens seem a feather.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But when the Roman Shepherd I was made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then I discovered life to be a lie.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw that there the heart was not at rest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor farther in that life could one ascend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby the love of this was kindled in me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until that time a wretched soul and parted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From God was I, and wholly avaricious;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What avarice does is here made manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the purgation of these souls converted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And no more bitter pain the Mountain has.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as our eye did not uplift itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So justice here has merged it in the earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As avarice had extinguished our affection</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For every good, whereby was action lost,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So justice here doth hold us in restraint,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And so long as it pleases the just Lord</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But even as I began, and he was ’ware,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Only by listening, of my reverence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What cause,” he said, “has downward bent thee thus?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I to him: “For your own dignity,</span>

					<span class="i1">Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span id="purgatorio-canto-19-line-133">“Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He answered: “Err not, fellow-servant am I<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-896" id="noteref-896" epub:type="noteref">896</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now go; no longer will I have thee linger,</span>

					<span class="i1">Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping,</span>

					<span class="i1">To think conditions here below are changed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When will he come through whom she shall depart?<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-903" id="noteref-903" epub:type="noteref">903</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I attentive to the shades I heard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Piteously weeping and bemoaning them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I by peradventure heard “Sweet Mary!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uttered in front of us amid the weeping</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as a woman does who is in child-birth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And in continuance: “How poor thou wast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is manifested by that hostelry<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-904" id="noteref-904" epub:type="noteref">904</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafterward I heard: “O good Fabricius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-905" id="noteref-905" epub:type="noteref">905</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the possession of great wealth with vice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So pleasurable were these words to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I drew farther onward to have knowledge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He furthermore was speaking of the largess<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-906" id="noteref-906" epub:type="noteref">906</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-907" id="noteref-907" epub:type="noteref">907</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In order to conduct their youth to honor.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O soul that dost so excellently speak,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tell me who wast thou,” said I, “and why only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost renew these praises well deserved?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not without recompense shall be thy word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If I return to finish the short journey</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that life which is flying to its end.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he: “I’ll tell thee, not for any comfort</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I may expect from earth, but that so much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was the root of that malignant plant<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-908" id="noteref-908" epub:type="noteref">908</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which overshadows all the Christian world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had power, soon vengeance would be taken on it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this I pray of Him who judges all.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From me were born the Louises and Philips,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-909" id="noteref-909" epub:type="noteref">909</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By whom in later days has France been governed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I was the son of a Parisian butcher,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-910" id="noteref-910" epub:type="noteref">910</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the ancient kings had perished all,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-911" id="noteref-911" epub:type="noteref">911</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I found me grasping in my hands the rein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the realm’s government, and so great power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That to the widowed diadem promoted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The head of mine own offspring was, from whom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-912" id="noteref-912" epub:type="noteref">912</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The consecrated bones of these began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long as the great dowry of Provence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-913" id="noteref-913" epub:type="noteref">913</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Out of my blood took not the sense of shame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twas little worth, but still it did no harm.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then it began with falsehood and with force</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-914" id="noteref-914" epub:type="noteref">914</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Charles came to Italy, and for amends<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-915" id="noteref-915" epub:type="noteref">915</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A victim made of Conradin, and then<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-916" id="noteref-916" epub:type="noteref">916</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-917" id="noteref-917" epub:type="noteref">917</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A time I see, not very distant now,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which draweth forth another Charles from France,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-918" id="noteref-918" epub:type="noteref">918</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The better to make known both him and his.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-919" id="noteref-919" epub:type="noteref">919</a></span>

					<span class="i1">So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-920" id="noteref-920" epub:type="noteref">920</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>He thence not land, but sin and infamy,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-921" id="noteref-921" epub:type="noteref">921</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As corsairs do with other female slaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-923" id="noteref-923" epub:type="noteref">923</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It careth not for its own proper flesh?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That less may seem the future ill and past,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-924" id="noteref-924" epub:type="noteref">924</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Christ in his own Vicar captive made.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-925" id="noteref-925" epub:type="noteref">925</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see him yet another time derided;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I see renewed the vinegar and gall,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And between living thieves I see him slain.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I see the modern Pilate so relentless,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-926" id="noteref-926" epub:type="noteref">926</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This does not sate him, but without decretal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He to the temple bears his sordid sails!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By looking on the vengeance which, concealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What I was saying of that only bride<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-927" id="noteref-927" epub:type="noteref">927</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To turn towards me for some commentary,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So long has been ordained to all our prayers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As the day lasts; but when the night comes on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Contrary sound we take instead thereof.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>At that time we repeat Pygmalion,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-928" id="noteref-928" epub:type="noteref">928</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made his insatiable desire of gold;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the misery of avaricious Midas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-929" id="noteref-929" epub:type="noteref">929</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That followed his inordinate demand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At which forevermore one needs but laugh.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The foolish Achan each one then records,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-930" id="noteref-930" epub:type="noteref">930</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Joshua still appears to sting him here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-931" id="noteref-931" epub:type="noteref">931</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-932" id="noteref-932" epub:type="noteref">932</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the whole mount in infamy encircles</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-933" id="noteref-933" epub:type="noteref">933</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here finally is cried: ‘O Crassus, tell us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-934" id="noteref-934" epub:type="noteref">934</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According to desire of speech, that spurs us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To greater now and now to lesser pace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But in the good that here by day is talked of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-935" id="noteref-935" epub:type="noteref">935</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No other person lifted up his voice.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From him already we departed were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And made endeavor to o’ercome the road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much as was permitted to our power,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I perceived, like something that is falling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-936" id="noteref-936" epub:type="noteref">936</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As seizes him who to his death is going.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Certes so violently shook not Delos,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-937" id="noteref-937" epub:type="noteref">937</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before Latona made her nest therein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then upon all sides there began a cry,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that the Master drew himself towards me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying, “Fear not, while I am guiding thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Gloria in excelsis Deo</i>,” all<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-938" id="noteref-938" epub:type="noteref">938</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were saying, from what near I comprehended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where it was possible to hear the cry.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We paused immovable and in suspense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Even as the shepherds who first heard that song,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-939" id="noteref-939" epub:type="noteref">939</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then we resumed again our holy path,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching the shades that lay upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Already turned to their accustomed plaint.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No ignorance ever with so great a strife</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had rendered me importunate to know,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If erreth not in this my memory,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As meditating then I seemed to have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor out of haste to question did I dare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor of myself I there could aught perceive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I went onward timorous and thoughtful.</span>

					<span class="i1">Along the encumbered path behind my Leader,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I was pitying that righteous vengeance;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-942" id="noteref-942" epub:type="noteref">942</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That Christ appeared to two upon the way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the sepulchral cave already risen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shade appeared to us, and came behind us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down gazing on the prostrate multitude,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor were we ware of it, until it spake,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Saying, “My brothers, may God give you peace!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To him the countersign thereto conforming.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-943" id="noteref-943" epub:type="noteref">943</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereon began he: “In the blessed council,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thee may the court veracious place in peace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That me doth banish in eternal exile!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How,” said he, and the while we went with speed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who up his stairs so far has guided you?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said my Teacher: “If thou note the marks<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-944" id="noteref-944" epub:type="noteref">944</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because she who spinneth day and night<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-945" id="noteref-945" epub:type="noteref">945</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For him had not yet drawn the distaff off,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His soul, which is thy sister and my own,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In coming upwards could not come alone,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason that it sees not in our fashion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As far on as my school has power to lead.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-946" id="noteref-946" epub:type="noteref">946</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In asking he so hit the very eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of my desire, that merely with the hope</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My thirst became the less unsatisfied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Naught is there,” he began, “that without order<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-947" id="noteref-947" epub:type="noteref">947</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">May the religion of the mountain feel,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Free is it here from every permutation;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What from itself heaven in itself receiveth<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-948" id="noteref-948" epub:type="noteref">948</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Can be of this the cause, and naught beside;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the short, little stairway of three steps.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-949" id="noteref-949" epub:type="noteref">949</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-950" id="noteref-950" epub:type="noteref">950</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That often upon earth her region shifts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No arid vapor any farther rises</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than to the top of the three steps I spake of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Lower down perchance it trembles less or more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I know not how, up here it never trembled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>It trembles here, whenever any soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of purity the will alone gives proof,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, being wholly free to change its convent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>First it wills well; but the desire permits not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which divine justice with the self-same will<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-951" id="noteref-951" epub:type="noteref">951</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There was to sin, upon the torment sets.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, who have been lying in this pain</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Five hundred years and more, but just now felt</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A free volition for a better seat.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Spirits along the mountain rendering praise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So said he to him; and since we enjoy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As much in drinking as the thirst is great,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I could not say how much it did me good.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the wise Leader: “Now I see the net</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That snares you here, and how ye are set free,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And why so many centuries thou hast here</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Been lying, let me gather from thy words.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“In days when the good Titus, with the aid<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-952" id="noteref-952" epub:type="noteref">952</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds</span>

					<span class="i1">Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under the name that most endures and honors,</span>

					<span class="i1">Was I on earth,” that spirit made reply,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-953" id="noteref-953" epub:type="noteref">953</a></span>

					<span>Statius the people name me still on earth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But on the way fell with my second burden.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The seeds unto my ardor were the sparks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that celestial flame which heated me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereby more than a thousand have been fired;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A mother was, and was my nurse in song;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without this weighed I not a drachma’s weight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to have lived upon the earth what time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-954" id="noteref-954" epub:type="noteref">954</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More than I must ere issuing from my ban.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words towards me made Virgilius turn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With looks that in their silence said, “Be silent!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But yet the power that wills cannot do all things;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For tears and laughter are such pursuivants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the passion from which each springs forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In the most truthful least the will they follow.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I only smiled, as one who gives the wink;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into mine eyes, where most expression dwells;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, “As thou well mayst consummate a labor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great,” it said, “why did thy face just now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Display to me the lightning of a smile?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-955" id="noteref-955" epub:type="noteref">955</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now am I caught on this side and on that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Speak,” said my Master, “and be not afraid</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What he demands with such solicitude.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I: “Thou peradventure marvellest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O antique spirit, at the smile I gave;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I will have more wonder seize upon thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To sing aloud of men and of the Gods.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If other cause thou to my smile imputedst,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Abandon it as false, and trust it was</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already he was stooping to embrace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Teacher’s feet; but he said to him: “Brother,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-956" id="noteref-956" epub:type="noteref">956</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he uprising: “Now canst thou the sum</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of love which warms me to thee comprehend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When this our vanity I disremember,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Treating a shadow as substantial thing.”</span>

					<span>Already was the Angel left behind us,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-957" id="noteref-957" epub:type="noteref">957</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having erased one mark from off my face;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And those who have in justice their desire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had said to us, “<i xml:lang="la">Beati</i>,” in their voices,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-958" id="noteref-958" epub:type="noteref">958</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With “<i xml:lang="la">sitio</i>,” and without more ended it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I, more light than through the other passes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went onward so, that without any labor</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I followed upward the swift-footed spirits;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thus Virgilius began: “The love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled by virtue aye another kindles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Provided outwardly its flame appear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-959" id="noteref-959" epub:type="noteref">959</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among us into the infernal Limbo,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who made apparent to me thy affection,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My kindliness towards thee was as great</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As ever bound one to an unseen person,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that these stairs will now seem short to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, and forgive me as a friend,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If too great confidence let loose the rein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as a friend now hold discourse with me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How was it possible within thy breast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For avarice to find place, ’mid so much wisdom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>These words excited Statius at first</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Each word of thine is love’s dear sign to me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Verily oftentimes do things appear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which give fallacious matter to our doubts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Instead of the true causes which are hidden!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy question shows me thy belief to be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I was niggard in the other life,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It may be from the circle where I was;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too far from me; and this extravagance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thousands of lunar periods have punished.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As if indignant, unto human nature,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>‘To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-960" id="noteref-960" epub:type="noteref">960</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?’</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-961" id="noteref-961" epub:type="noteref">961</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Their wings in spending, and repented me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well of that as of my other sins;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How many with shorn hair shall rise again<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-962" id="noteref-962" epub:type="noteref">962</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because of ignorance, which from this sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cuts off repentance living and in death!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And know that the transgression which rebuts</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By direct opposition any sin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Together with it here its verdure dries.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore if I have been among that folk</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which mourns its avarice, to purify me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For its opposite has this befallen me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-963" id="noteref-963" epub:type="noteref">963</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The singer of the Songs Bucolic said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“From that which Clio there with thee preludes,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-964" id="noteref-964" epub:type="noteref">964</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That faith without which no good works suffice.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If this be so, what candles or what sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-965" id="noteref-965" epub:type="noteref">965</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to him: “Thou first directedst me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And first concerning God didst me enlighten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou didst as he who walketh in the night,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who bears his light behind, which helps him not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But maketh wise the persons after him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When thou didst say: ‘The age renews itself,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-966" id="noteref-966" epub:type="noteref">966</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Justice returns, and man’s primeval time,</span>

					<span class="i1">But that thou better see what I design,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To color it will I extend my hand.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Already was the world in every part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By messengers of the eternal kingdom;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy assertion, spoken of above,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With the new preachers was in unison;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence I to visit them the custom took.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they became so holy in my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, when Domitian persecuted them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not without tears of mine were their laments;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all the while that I on earth remained,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Them I befriended, and their upright customs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made me disparage all the other sects.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But out of fear was covertly a Christian,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For a long time professing paganism;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-967" id="noteref-967" epub:type="noteref">967</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To circuit round more than four centuries.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That hid from me whatever good I speak of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">While in ascending we have time to spare,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-968" id="noteref-968" epub:type="noteref">968</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>“These, Persius and myself, and others many,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-970" id="noteref-970" epub:type="noteref">970</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Replied my Leader, “with that Grecian are<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-971" id="noteref-971" epub:type="noteref">971</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled,</span>

					<span>In the first circle of the prison blind;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Simonides, Agatho, and many other<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-973" id="noteref-973" epub:type="noteref">973</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There some of thine own people may be seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Antigone, Deiphile and Argìa,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-974" id="noteref-974" epub:type="noteref">974</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there Ismene mournful as of old.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There she is seen who pointed out Langìa;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-975" id="noteref-975" epub:type="noteref">975</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There is Tiresias’ daughter, and there Thetis,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-976" id="noteref-976" epub:type="noteref">976</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And there Deidamia with her sisters.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-977" id="noteref-977" epub:type="noteref">977</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent already were the poets both,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attent once more in looking round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From the ascent and from the walls released;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And four handmaidens of the day already<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-978" id="noteref-978" epub:type="noteref">978</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was pointing upward still its burning horn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What time my Guide: “I think that tow’rds the edge</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Circling the mount as we are wont to do.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus in that region custom was our ensign;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And we resumed our way with less suspicion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the assenting of that worthy soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They in advance went on, and I alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind them, and I listened to their speech,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which gave me lessons in the art of song.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But soon their sweet discourses interrupted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A tree which midway in the road we found,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-979" id="noteref-979" epub:type="noteref">979</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With apples sweet and grateful to the smell.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as a fir-tree tapers upward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From bough to bough, so downwardly did that;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I think in order that no one might climb it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On that side where our pathway was enclosed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And spread itself abroad upon the leaves.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The Poets twain unto the tree drew near,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from among the foliage a voice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Cried: “Of this food ye shall have scarcity.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then said: “More thoughtful Mary was of making<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-980" id="noteref-980" epub:type="noteref">980</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The marriage feast complete and honorable,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than of her mouth which now for you responds;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And for their drink the ancient Roman women</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With water were content; and Daniel<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-981" id="noteref-981" epub:type="noteref">981</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Disparaged food, and understanding won.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The primal age was beautiful as gold;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-982" id="noteref-982" epub:type="noteref">982</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Acorns it made with hunger savorous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And nectar every rivulet with thirst.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Honey and locusts were the aliments</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That fed the Baptist in the wilderness;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence he is glorious, and so magnified</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As by the Evangel is revealed to you.”</span>

					<span class="i1">I riveted, as he is wont to do</span>

					<span>My more than Father said unto me: “Son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Come now; because the time that is ordained us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More usefully should be apportioned out.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned my face and no less soon my steps</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Sages, who were speaking so</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They made the going of no cost to me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! were heard a song and a lament,</span>

					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Labia mea, Domine</i>,” in fashion<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-985" id="noteref-985" epub:type="noteref">985</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that delight and dolence it brought forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began I; and he answered: “Shades that go</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who, unknown people on the road o’ertaking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A crowd of spirits silent and devout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pallid in face, and so emaciate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That from the bones the skin did shape itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do not think that so to merest rind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could Erisichthon have been withered up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-986" id="noteref-986" epub:type="noteref">986</a></span>

					<span class="i1">By famine, when most fear he had of it.</span>

					<span class="i1">When Mary made a prey of her own son.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-987" id="noteref-987" epub:type="noteref">987</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Whoever in the face of men reads <em>omo</em><a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-989" id="noteref-989" epub:type="noteref">989</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Might well in these have recognized the <em>m</em>.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who would believe the odor of an apple,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begetting longing, could consume them so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that of water, without knowing how?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I still was wondering what so famished them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For the occasion not yet manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of their emaciation and sad squalor;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! from out the hollow of his head</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then cried aloud: “What grace to me is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never should I have known him by his look;</span>

					<span>This spark within me wholly re-enkindled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My recognition of his altered face,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I recalled the features of Forese.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-990" id="noteref-990" epub:type="noteref">990</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entreated he, “which doth my skin discolor,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor at default of flesh that I may have;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me truth of thee, and who are those</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not delay in speaking unto me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That face of thine, which dead I once bewept,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I answered him, “beholding it so changed!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But tell me, for God’s sake, what thus denudes you?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Make me not speak while I am marvelling,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For ill speaks he who’s full of other longings.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “From the eternal council</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin.</span>

					<span>All of this people who lamenting sing,</span>

					<span class="i1">For following beyond measure appetite</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The scent that issues from the apple-tree,</span>

					<span>And not a single time alone, this ground</span>

					<span>For the same wish doth lead us to the tree</span>

					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “Forese, from that day</span>

					<span class="i1">When for a better life thou changedst worlds,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Up to this time five years have not rolled round.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If sooner were the power exhausted in thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised</span>

					<span class="i1">Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>How hast thou come up hitherward already?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I thought to find thee down there underneath,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-993" id="noteref-993" epub:type="noteref">993</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where time for time doth restitution make.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he to me: “Thus speedily has led me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Nella with her overflowing tears;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-994" id="noteref-994" epub:type="noteref">994</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>She with her prayers devout and with her sighs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has drawn me from the coast where one awaits,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And from the other circles set me free.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So much more dear and pleasing is to God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My little widow, whom so much I loved,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As in good works she is the more alone;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By far more modest in its women is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than the Barbagia I have left her in.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A future time is in my sight already,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To which this hour will not be very old,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the pulpit shall be interdicted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To the unblushing womankind of Florence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To go about displaying breast and paps.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-996" id="noteref-996" epub:type="noteref">996</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>What savages were e’er, what Saracens,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who stood in need, to make them covered go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of spiritual or other discipline?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But if the shameless women were assured</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wide open would they have their mouths to howl;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For if my foresight here deceive me not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who now is hushed to sleep with lullaby.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O brother, now no longer hide thee from me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">See that not only I, but all these people</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence I to him: “If thou bring back to mind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou with me hast been and I with thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The present memory will be grievous still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Out of that life he turned me back who goes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me, two days agone when round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sister of him yonder showed herself,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And to the sun I pointed. “Through the deep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Night of the truly dead has this one led me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With this true flesh, that follows after him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence his encouragements have led me up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ascending and still circling round the mount</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He says that he will bear me company,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Till I shall be where Beatrice will be;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There it behoves me to remain without him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And him I pointed at; “the other is</span>

					<span class="i1">That shade for whom just now shook every slope<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-997" id="noteref-997" epub:type="noteref">997</a></span>

					<span>And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead,</span>

					<span class="i1">From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wonder at me, aware that I was living.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Peradventure he goes up more slowly</span>

					<span>He named me many others one by one;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that for this I saw not one dark look.</span>
					<br/>

					<span>I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1006" id="noteref-1006" epub:type="noteref">1006</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And he was one who ne’er felt satisfied.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But as he does who scans, and then doth prize</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One more than others, did I him of Lucca,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who seemed to take most cognizance of me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1007" id="noteref-1007" epub:type="noteref">1007</a></span>

					<span class="i1">From that place heard I, where he felt the wound<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1008" id="noteref-1008" epub:type="noteref">1008</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of justice, that doth macerate them so.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O soul,” I said, “that seemest so desirous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with thy speech appease thyself and me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,”</span>

					<span class="i1">My city, howsoever men may blame it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">True things hereafter will declare it to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But say if him I here behold, who forth</span>

					<span class="i1">Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1009" id="noteref-1009" epub:type="noteref">1009</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1"><em>Ladies, that have intelligence of love?</em>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1010" id="noteref-1010" epub:type="noteref">1010</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I to him: “One am I, who, whenever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which he within me dictates, singing go.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O brother, now I see,” he said, “the knot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1011" id="noteref-1011" epub:type="noteref">1011</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Short of the sweet new style that now I hear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I do perceive full clearly how your pens</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Go closely following after him who dictates,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which with our own forsooth came not to pass;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he who sets himself to go beyond,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No difference sees from one style to another”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And as if satisfied, he held his peace.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the birds, that winter tow’rds the Nile,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then fly in greater haste, and go in file;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In such wise all the people who were there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning their faces, hurried on their steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both by their leanness and their wishes light.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a man, who weary is with trotting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lets his companions onward go, and walks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until he vents the panting of his chest;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did Forese let the holy flock</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“When will it be that I again shall see thee?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“How long,” I answered, “I may live, I know not;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Yet my return will not so speedy be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But I shall sooner in desire arrive;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Because the place where I was set to live</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From day to day of good is more depleted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Now go,” he said, “for him most guilty of it<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1012" id="noteref-1012" epub:type="noteref">1012</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At a beast’s tail behold I dragged along</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards the valley where is no repentance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Faster at every step the beast is going,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Increasing evermore until it smites him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And leaves the body vilely mutilated.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not long those wheels shall turn,” and he uplifted</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His eyes to heaven, “ere shall be clear to thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which my speech no farther can declare.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now stay behind; because the time so precious</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By coming onward thus abreast with thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A cavalier from out a troop that ride,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And seeks the honor of the first encounter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So he with greater strides departed from us;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And on the road remained I with those two,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who were such mighty marshals of the world.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1013" id="noteref-1013" epub:type="noteref">1013</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And when before us he had gone so far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As was my understanding to his words,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Appeared to me with laden and living boughs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Another apple-tree, and not far distant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From having but just then turned thitherward.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1014" id="noteref-1014" epub:type="noteref">1014</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>People I saw beneath it lift their hands,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And cry I know not what towards the leaves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like little children eager and deluded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, to make very keen their appetite,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then they departed as if undeceived;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And now we came unto the mighty tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Pass farther onward without drawing near;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The tree of which Eve ate is higher up,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1015" id="noteref-1015" epub:type="noteref">1015</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And out of that one has this tree been raised.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus said I know not who among the branches;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Went crowding forward on the side that rises.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Be mindful,” said he, “of the accursed ones<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1016" id="noteref-1016" epub:type="noteref">1016</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Combated Theseus with their double breasts;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence Gideon would not have them for companions<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1017" id="noteref-1017" epub:type="noteref">1017</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he tow’rds Midian the hills descended.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Followed forsooth by miserable gains;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then set at large upon the lonely road,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A thousand steps and more we onward went,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In contemplation, each without a word.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As terrified and timid beasts are wont.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I raised my head to see who this might be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And never in a furnace was there seen</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Metals or glass so lucent and so red</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As one I saw who said: “If it may please you<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1018" id="noteref-1018" epub:type="noteref">1018</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This way goes he who goeth after peace.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>His aspect had bereft me of my sight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that I turned me back unto my Teachers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as, the harbinger of early dawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My front, and felt the moving of the plumes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That breathed around an odor of ambrosia;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And heard it said: “Blessed are they whom grace</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So much illumines, that the love of taste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Excites not in their breasts too great desire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hungering at all times so far as is just.”</span>

					<span class="i1">If of necessity the sting transfix him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In this wise did we enter through the gap,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Taking the stairway, one before the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by its narrowness divides the climbers.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the little stork that lifts its wing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With a desire to fly, and does not venture</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even such was I, with the desire of asking</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He makes who doth address himself to speak.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1021" id="noteref-1021" epub:type="noteref">1021</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not for our pace, though rapid it might be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My father sweet forbore, but said: “Let fly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With confidence I opened then my mouth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I began: “How can one meagre grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There where the need of nutriment applies not?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1022" id="noteref-1022" epub:type="noteref">1022</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was wasted by the wasting of a brand,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This would not,” said he, “be to thee so sour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembles within a mirror your own image;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He now will be the healer of thy wounds.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Responded Statius, “where thou present art,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then he began: “Son, if these words of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They’ll be thy light unto the How thou sayest.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The perfect blood, which never is drunk up<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1023" id="noteref-1023" epub:type="noteref">1023</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like food that from the table thou removest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Takes in the heart for all the human members</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtue informative, as being that</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which to be changed to them goes through the veins.</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Silent to be than say; and then drops thence</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon another’s blood in natural vase.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There one together with the other mingles,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One to be passive meant, the other active</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of the perfect place it springs from;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1024" id="noteref-1024" epub:type="noteref">1024</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And being conjoined, begins to operate,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coagulating first, then vivifying</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What for its matter it had made consistent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The active virtue, being made a soul<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1025" id="noteref-1025" epub:type="noteref">1025</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As of a plant, (in so far different,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This on the way is, that arrived already,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then works so much, that now it moves and feels<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1026" id="noteref-1026" epub:type="noteref">1026</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To organize the powers whose seed it is.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The virtue from the generator’s heart,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where nature is intent on all the members.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But how from animal it man becomes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made a wiser man than thou once err</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So far, that in his doctrine separate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He made the soul from possible intellect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1027" id="noteref-1027" epub:type="noteref">1027</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For he no organ saw by this assumed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Open thy breast unto the truth that’s coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And know that, just as soon as in the foetus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The articulation of the brain is perfect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The primal Motor turns to it well pleased<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1028" id="noteref-1028" epub:type="noteref">1028</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">At so great art of nature, and inspires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A spirit new with virtue all replete,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Which what it finds there active doth attract</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into its substance, and becomes one soul,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1029" id="noteref-1029" epub:type="noteref">1029</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that thou less may wonder at my word,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the sun’s heat, which becometh wine,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Joined to the juice that from the vine distils.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whenever Lachesis has no more thread,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1030" id="noteref-1030" epub:type="noteref">1030</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It separates from the flesh, and virtually</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bears with itself the human and divine;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1031" id="noteref-1031" epub:type="noteref">1031</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The other faculties are voiceless all;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The memory, the intelligence, and the will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In action far more vigorous than before.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without a pause it falleth of itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In marvellous way on one shore or the other;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1032" id="noteref-1032" epub:type="noteref">1032</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There of its roads it first is cognizant.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Soon as the place there circumscribeth it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The virtue informative rays round about,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As, and as much as, in the living members.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as the air, when full of rain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By alien rays that are therein reflected,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With divers colors shows itself adorned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So there the neighboring air doth shape itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into that form which doth impress upon it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virtually the soul that has stood still.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then in manner of the little flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which followeth the fire where’er it shifts,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the spirit followeth its new form.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It is called shade; and thence it organizes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thereafter every sense, even to the sight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1033" id="noteref-1033" epub:type="noteref">1033</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>According as impress us our desires</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And other affections, so the shade is shaped,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now unto the last of all the circles</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had we arrived, and to the right hand turned,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And were attentive to another care.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That drives them back, and from itself sequesters.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hence we must needs go on the open side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And one by one; and I did fear the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On this side, and on that the falling down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My Leader said: “Along this place one ought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing that one so easily might err.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Summæ Deus clementiæ</i>,” in the bosom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1034" id="noteref-1034" epub:type="noteref">1034</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the great burning chanted then I heard,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made me no less eager to turn round;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And spirits saw I walking through the flame;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Apportioning my sight from time to time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the close which to that hymn is made,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aloud they shouted, “<i xml:lang="la">Virum non cognosco</i>”;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1035" id="noteref-1035" epub:type="noteref">1035</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then recommenced the hymn with voices low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This also ended, cried they: “To the wood</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Diana ran, and drove forth Helice<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1036" id="noteref-1036" epub:type="noteref">1036</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to their song returned they; then the wives</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I believe that them this mode suffices,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all the time the fire is burning them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With such care is it needful, and such food,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That the last wound of all should be closed up.</span>

					<span>While on the brink thus one before the other<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1037" id="noteref-1037" epub:type="noteref">1037</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We went upon our way, oft the good Master</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said: “Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the right shoulder smote me now the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That, raying out, already the whole west<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1038" id="noteref-1038" epub:type="noteref">1038</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Changed from its azure aspect into white.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And with my shadow did I make the flame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appear more red; and even to such a sign</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This was the cause that gave them a beginning</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To speak of me; and to themselves began they</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To say: “That seems not a factitious body!”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1039" id="noteref-1039" epub:type="noteref">1039</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then towards me, as far as they could come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came certain of them, always with regard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not to step forth where they would not be burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O thou who goest, not from being slower</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But reverent perhaps, behind the others,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor to me only is thine answer needful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For all of these have greater thirst for it</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Entered as yet into the net of death.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should have revealed myself, were I not bent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On other novelty that then appeared.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For through the middle of the burning road</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There came a people face to face with these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which held me in suspense with gazing at them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>There see I hastening upon either side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each of the shades, and kissing one another</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Without a pause, content with brief salute.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus in the middle of their brown battalions</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>No sooner is the friendly greeting ended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or ever the first footstep passes onward,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one endeavors to outcry the other;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The new-come people: “Sodom and Gomorrah!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest: “Into the cow Pasiphae enters,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1040" id="noteref-1040" epub:type="noteref">1040</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the bull unto her lust may run!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1041" id="noteref-1041" epub:type="noteref">1041</a></span>

					<span>One folk is going, and the other coming,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And weeping they return to their first songs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And to the cry that most befitteth them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And close to me approached, even as before,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The very same who had entreated me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Attent to listen in their countenance.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I, who their inclination twice had seen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Began: “O souls secure in the possession,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er it may be, of a state of peace,</span>

					<span>Neither unripe nor ripened have remained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My members upon earth, but here are with me</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which full of love is, and most amply spreads,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Tell me, that I again in books may write it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who are you, and what is that multitude</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which goes upon its way behind your backs?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb,</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He recommenced who first had questioned us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Experience freightest for a better life.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The folk that comes not with us have offended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In that for which once Caesar, triumphing,</span>

					<span class="i1">Such I became, but rise not to such height,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The moment I heard name himself the father</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of me and of my betters, who had ever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And without speech and hearing thoughtfully</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For a long time I went, beholding him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I was fed with looking, utterly</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Myself I offered ready for his service,</span>

					<span class="i1">With affirmation that compels belief.</span>

					<span>And he to me: “Thou leavest footprints such</span>

					<span class="i1">And in this way establish their opinion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere art or reason has by them been heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus many ancients with Guittone did,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1050" id="noteref-1050" epub:type="noteref">1050</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From cry to cry still giving him applause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Until the truth has conquered with most persons.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now, if thou hast such ample privilege</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To him repeat for me a Paternoster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So far as needful to us of this world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where power of sinning is no longer ours.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, to give place perchance to one behind,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As fish in water going to the bottom.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I moved a little tow’rds him pointed out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And said that to his name my own desire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1051" id="noteref-1051" epub:type="noteref">1051</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An honorable place was making ready.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He of his own free will began to say:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">
						<i xml:lang="pro">Tan m’ abellis vostre cortes deman,</i>

					<span>As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1054" id="noteref-1054" epub:type="noteref">1054</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In regions where his Maker shed his blood,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1055" id="noteref-1055" epub:type="noteref">1055</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">(The Ebro falling under lofty Libra,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When the glad Angel of God appeared to us.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Outside the flame he stood upon the verge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And chanted forth, “<i xml:lang="la">Beati mundo corde</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1056" id="noteref-1056" epub:type="noteref">1056</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In voice by far more living than our own.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then: “No one farther goes, souls sanctified,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If first the fire bite not; within it enter,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And be not deaf unto the song beyond.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When we were close beside him thus he said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Wherefore e’en such became I, when I heard him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he is who is put into the grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon my clasped hands I straightened me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1057" id="noteref-1057" epub:type="noteref">1057</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The human bodies I had once seen burned.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto me Virgilius said: “My son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here may indeed be torment, but not death.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Remember thee, remember! and if I</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On Geryon have safely guided thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1058" id="noteref-1058" epub:type="noteref">1058</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What shall I do now I am nearer God?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Millennium in the bosom of this flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It could not make thee bald a single hair.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Draw near to it, and put it to the proof</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With thine own hands upon thy garment’s hem.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turn hitherward, and onward come securely”;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And I still motionless, and ’gainst my conscience!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1059" id="noteref-1059" epub:type="noteref">1059</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Somewhat disturbed he said: “Now look thou, Son,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">’Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1060" id="noteref-1060" epub:type="noteref">1060</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What time the mulberry became vermilion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even thus, my obduracy being softened,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in my memory evermore is welling.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whereat he wagged his head, and said: “How now?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Shall we stay on this side?” then smiled as one</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Does at a child who’s vanquished by an apple.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then into the fire in front of me he entered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beseeching Statius to come after me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who a long way before divided us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1061" id="noteref-1061" epub:type="noteref">1061</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I was in it, into molten glass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would have cast me to refresh myself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So without measure was the burning there!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my sweet Father, to encourage me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Discoursing still of Beatrice went on,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saying: “Her eyes I seem to see already!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A voice, that on the other side was singing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Directed us, and we, attent alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that, came forth where the ascent began.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Venite, benedicti Patris mei</i>,”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1062" id="noteref-1062" epub:type="noteref">1062</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sounded within a splendor, which was there</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such it o’ercame me, and I could not look.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“The sun departs,” it added, “and night cometh;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long as yet the west becomes not dark.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Straight forward through the rock the path ascended</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such a way that I cut off the rays</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before me of the sun, that now was low.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And of few stairs we yet had made assay,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere by the vanished shadow the sun’s setting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behind us we perceived, I and my Sages.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And ere in all its parts immeasurable<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1063" id="noteref-1063" epub:type="noteref">1063</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The horizon of one aspect had become,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Night her boundless dispensation held,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Each of us of a stair had made his bed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because the nature of the mount took from us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The power of climbing, more than the delight.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as in ruminating passive grow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The goats, who have been swift and venturesome</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Passes the night beside his quiet flock,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Watching that no wild beast may scatter it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such at that hour were we, all three of us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Begirt on this side and on that by rocks.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Little could there be seen of things without;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But through that little I beheld the stars</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">More luminous and larger than their wont.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1064" id="noteref-1064" epub:type="noteref">1064</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus ruminating, and beholding these,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sleep seized upon me⁠—sleep, that oftentimes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before a deed is done has tidings of it.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1065" id="noteref-1065" epub:type="noteref">1065</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>It was the hour, I think, when from the East</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">First on the mountain Citherea beamed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1066" id="noteref-1066" epub:type="noteref">1066</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who with the fire of love seems always burning;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw a lady walking in a meadow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Know whosoever may my name demand<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1067" id="noteref-1067" epub:type="noteref">1067</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I am Leah, and go moving round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My beauteous hands to make myself a garland.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To please me at the mirror, here I deck me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But never does my sister Rachel leave</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As I am to adorn me with my hands;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now before the antelucan splendors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As, home-returning, less remote they lodge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The darkness fled away on every side,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1068" id="noteref-1068" epub:type="noteref">1068</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And slumber with it; whereupon I rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seeing already the great Masters risen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That apple sweet, which through so many branches<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1069" id="noteref-1069" epub:type="noteref">1069</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Today shall put in peace thy hungerings.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As these made use; and never were there guerdons</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That could in pleasantness compare with these.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such longing upon longing came upon me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To be above, that at each step thereafter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For flight I felt in me the pinions growing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When underneath us was the stairway all</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Run o’er, and we were on the highest step,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And said: “The temporal fire and the eternal,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where of myself no farther I discern.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>By intellect and art I here have brought thee;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of itself alone this land produces.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which weeping caused me to come unto thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Expect no more or word or sign from me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Free and upright and sound is thy free-will,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And error were it not to do its bidding;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thee o’er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!”</span>

					<span class="i1">Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">No heavier blow than of a gentle wind,</span>

					<span>Yet not from their upright direction swayed,</span>

					<span class="i1">So that the little birds upon their tops</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which tow’rd the left hand with its little waves</span>

					<span class="i1">Bent down the grass that on its margin sprang.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>All waters that on earth most limpid are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would seem to have within themselves some mixture</span>

					<span class="i1">Compared with that which nothing doth conceal,</span>

					<span class="i1">Under the shade perpetual, that never</span>

					<span class="i1">Beyond the rivulet, to look upon</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The great variety of the fresh may.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And there appeared to me (even as appears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suddenly something that doth turn aside</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through very wonder every other thought)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A lady all alone, who went along<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1074" id="noteref-1074" epub:type="noteref">1074</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Singing and culling floweret after floweret,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which her pathway was all painted over.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which the heart’s witnesses are wont to be,</span>

					<span class="i1">And hardly puts one foot before the other,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She turned towards me, not in other wise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my entreaties made to be content,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So near approaching, that the dulcet sound</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came unto me together with its meaning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as she was where the grasses are</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lift her eyes she granted me the boon.</span>

					<span>“The water,” said I, “and the forest’s sound,</span>

					<span class="i1">And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee.</span>

					<span>The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting,</span>

					<span class="i1">Created man good, and this goodly place</span>

					<span>By his default short while he sojourned here;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1080" id="noteref-1080" epub:type="noteref">1080</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By his default to weeping and to toil</span>

					<span>That the disturbance which below is made</span>

					<span class="i1">(Which far as may be follow after heat,)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Might not upon mankind wage any war,</span>

					<span class="i1">This mount ascended tow’rds the heaven so high,</span>

					<span>Now since the universal atmosphere</span>

					<span class="i1">Turns in a circuit with the primal motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unless the circle is broken on some side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this height, that all is disengaged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In living ether, doth this motion strike</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And make the forest sound, for it is dense;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And so much power the stricken plant possesses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That with its virtue it impregns the air,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And this, revolving, scatters it around;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And yonder earth, according as ’tis worthy</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In self or in its clime, conceives and bears</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of divers qualities the divers trees;</span>

					<span>It should not seem a marvel then on earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This being heard, whenever any plant</span>

					<span class="i1">Without seed manifest there taketh root.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thou must know, this holy table-land</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In which thou art is full of every seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And fruit has in it never gathered there.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water which thou seest springs not from vein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Restored by vapor that the cold condenses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Like to a stream that gains or loses breath;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But issues from a fountain safe and certain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by the will of God as much regains</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As it discharges, open on two sides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon this side with virtue it descends,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which takes away all memory of sin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On that, of every good deed done restores it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here Lethe, as upon the other side</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Eunoë, it is called; and worketh not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If first on either side it be not tasted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>This every other savor doth transcend;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And notwithstanding slaked so far may be</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I’ll give thee a corollary still in grace,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If it spread out beyond my promise to thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Those who in ancient times have feigned in song</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Age of Gold and its felicity,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Here was the human race in innocence;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">This is the nectar of which each one speaks.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then backward did I turn me wholly round</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1082" id="noteref-1082" epub:type="noteref">1082</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had been listening to these closing words;</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She, with the ending of her words, continued:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1084" id="noteref-1084" epub:type="noteref">1084</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One to avoid and one to see the sun,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She then against the stream moved onward, going</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the bank, and I abreast of her,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Her little steps with little steps attending.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Between her steps and mine were not a hundred,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1085" id="noteref-1085" epub:type="noteref">1085</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When equally the margins gave a turn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In such a way, that to the East I faced.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor even thus our way continued far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the lady wholly turned herself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto me, saying, “Brother, look and listen!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And lo! a sudden lustre ran across</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">On every side athwart the spacious forest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since the lightning ceases as it comes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And that continuing brightened more and more,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within my thought I said, “What thing is this?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And a delicious melody there ran</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For there where earth and heaven obedient were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The woman only, and but just created,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Could not endure to stay ’neath any veil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Underneath which had she devoutly stayed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I sooner should have tasted those delights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ineffable, and for a longer time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While ’mid such manifold first-fruits I walked</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And still solicitous of more delights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In front of us like an enkindled fire</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Became the air beneath the verdant boughs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the sweet sound as singing now was heard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vigils, or cold for you I have endured,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The occasion spurs me their reward to claim!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with her choir Urania must assist me,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1086" id="noteref-1086" epub:type="noteref">1086</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To put in verse things difficult to think.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A little farther on, seven trees of gold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In semblance the long space still intervening</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between ourselves and them did counterfeit;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when I had approached so near to them</span>

					<span class="i1">The common object, which the sense deceives,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1087" id="noteref-1087" epub:type="noteref">1087</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lost not by distance any of its marks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The faculty that lends discourse to reason<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1088" id="noteref-1088" epub:type="noteref">1088</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did apprehend that they were candlesticks,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1089" id="noteref-1089" epub:type="noteref">1089</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in the voices of the song “Hosanna!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Above them flamed the harness beautiful,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Far brighter than the moon in the serene</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of midnight, at the middle of her month.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I turned me round, with admiration filled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To good Virgilius, and he answered me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With visage no less full of wonderment.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then back I turned my face to those high things,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which moved themselves towards us so sedately,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">They had been distanced by new-wedded brides.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady chid me: “Why dost thou burn only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So with affection for the living lights,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And dost not look at what comes after them?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then saw I people, as behind their leaders,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coming behind them, garmented in white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And such a whiteness never was on earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The water on my left flank was resplendent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And back to me reflected my left side,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">E’en as a mirror, if I looked therein.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I upon my margin had such post</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That nothing but the stream divided us,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Better to see I gave my steps repose;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I beheld the flamelets onward go,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Leaving behind themselves the air depicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And they of trailing pennons had the semblance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So that it overhead remained distinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence the sun’s bow is made, and Delia’s girdle.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1090" id="noteref-1090" epub:type="noteref">1090</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>These standards to the rearward longer were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ten paces were the outermost apart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Under so fair a heaven as I describe</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The four and twenty Elders, two by two,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1091" id="noteref-1091" epub:type="noteref">1091</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>They all of them were singing: “Blessed thou<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1092" id="noteref-1092" epub:type="noteref">1092</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For evermore shall be thy loveliness.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the flowers and other tender grasses</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In front of me upon the other margin</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were disencumbered of that race elect,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as in heaven star followeth after star,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">There came close after them four animals,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1093" id="noteref-1093" epub:type="noteref">1093</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Incoronate each one with verdant leaf.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Plumed with six wings was every one of them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If they were living would be such as these.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My rhymes; for other spendings press me so,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That I in this cannot be prodigal.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1094" id="noteref-1094" epub:type="noteref">1094</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As he beheld them from the region cold</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as thou shalt find them in his pages,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such were they here; saving that in their plumage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">John is with me, and differeth from him.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1095" id="noteref-1095" epub:type="noteref">1095</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The interval between these four contained</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A chariot triumphal on two wheels,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1096" id="noteref-1096" epub:type="noteref">1096</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which by a Griffin’s neck came drawn along;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1097" id="noteref-1097" epub:type="noteref">1097</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And upward he extended both his wings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Between the middle list and three and three,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1098" id="noteref-1098" epub:type="noteref">1098</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that he injured none by cleaving it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So high they rose that they were lost to sight;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And white the others with vermilion mingled.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only Rome with no such splendid car</span>

					<span>That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up</span>

					<span class="i1">At the importunate orison of Earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When Jove was so mysteriously just.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1100" id="noteref-1100" epub:type="noteref">1100</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Came onward dancing; one so very red</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That in the fire she hardly had been noted.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The second was as if her flesh and bones</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had all been fashioned out of emerald;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The third appeared as snow but newly fallen.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And now they seemed conducted by the white,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now by the red, and from the song of her</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others took their step, or slow or swift.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the left hand four made holiday<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1102" id="noteref-1102" epub:type="noteref">1102</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested in purple, following the measure</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of one of them with three eyes in her head.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In rear of all the group here treated of<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1103" id="noteref-1103" epub:type="noteref">1103</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But like in gait, each dignified and grave.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>One showed himself as one of the disciples<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1104" id="noteref-1104" epub:type="noteref">1104</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Terror to me on this side of the river.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1106" id="noteref-1106" epub:type="noteref">1106</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And behind all an aged man alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1107" id="noteref-1107" epub:type="noteref">1107</a></span>

					<span class="i1">Walking in sleep with countenance acute.</span>

					<span class="i1">At little distance would the sight have sworn</span>

					<span class="i1">That all were in a flame above their brows.</span>

					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Manibus o date lilia plenis.</i>”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1113" id="noteref-1113" epub:type="noteref">1113</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Ere now have I beheld, as day began,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the other heaven with fair serene adorned;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And the sun’s face, uprising, overshadowed<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1114" id="noteref-1114" epub:type="noteref">1114</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that by tempering influence of vapors</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For a long interval the eye sustained it;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which from those hands angelical ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And downward fell again inside and out,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Appeared a lady under a green mantle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1115" id="noteref-1115" epub:type="noteref">1115</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Vested in color of the living flame.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And my own spirit, that already now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So long a time had been, that in her presence<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1116" id="noteref-1116" epub:type="noteref">1116</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1117" id="noteref-1117" epub:type="noteref">1117</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Without more knowledge having by mine eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through occult virtue that from her proceeded</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of ancient love the mighty influence felt.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as on my vision smote the power</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Sublime, that had already pierced me through</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To the left hand I turned with that reliance</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With which the little child runs to his mother,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When he has fear, or when he is afflicted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>To say unto Virgilius: “Not a drachm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I know the traces of the ancient flame.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1118" id="noteref-1118" epub:type="noteref">1118</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But us Virgilius of himself deprived</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1119" id="noteref-1119" epub:type="noteref">1119</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Availed my cheeks now purified from dew,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That weeping they should not again be darkened.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Dante, because Virgilius has departed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For by another sword thou need’st must weep.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en as an admiral, who on poop and prow</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Comes to behold the people that are working</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Upon the left hand border of the car,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When at the sound I turned of my own name,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which of necessity is here recorded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Veiled underneath the angelic festival,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Direct her eyes to me across the river.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Although the veil, that from her head descended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Encircled with the foliage of Minerva,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did not permit her to appear distinctly,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In attitude still royally majestic</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Continued she, like unto one who speaks,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Look at me well; in sooth I’m Beatrice!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Didst thou not know that man is happy here?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So great a shame did weigh my forehead down.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to the son the mother seems superb,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tasteth the savor of severe compassion.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Silent became she, and the Angels sang</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Suddenly, “<i xml:lang="la">In te, Domine, speravi</i>”:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1120" id="noteref-1120" epub:type="noteref">1120</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But beyond <i xml:lang="la">pedes meos</i> did not pass.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as the snow among the living rafters<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1121" id="noteref-1121" epub:type="noteref">1121</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the back of Italy congeals,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1122" id="noteref-1122" epub:type="noteref">1122</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And then, dissolving, trickles through itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whene’er the land that loses shadow breathes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that it seems a fire that melts a taper;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>E’en thus was I without a tear or sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the song of those who sing forever</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">After the music of the eternal spheres.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when I heard in their sweet melodies</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Compassion for me, more than had they said,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The ice, that was about my heart congealed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To air and water changed, and in my anguish</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She, on the right-hand border of the car</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Still firmly standing, to those holy beings</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thus her discourse directed afterwards:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Ye keep your watch in the eternal day,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">One step the ages make upon their path;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore my answer is with greater care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That he may hear me who is weeping yonder,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the sin and dole be of one measure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Not only by the work of those great wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That destine every seed unto some end,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">According as the stars are in conjunction,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But by the largess of celestial graces,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which have such lofty vapors for their rain<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1123" id="noteref-1123" epub:type="noteref">1123</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That near to them our sight approaches not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such had this man become in his new life</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Potentially, that every righteous habit</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would have made admirable proof in him;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But so much more malignant and more savage</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more good earthly vigor it possesses.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Some time did I sustain him with my look;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revealing unto him my youthful eyes,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I led him with me turned in the right way.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As soon as ever of my second age</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was upon the threshold and changed life,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1124" id="noteref-1124" epub:type="noteref">1124</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Himself from me he took and gave to others.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When from the flesh to spirit I ascended,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And beauty and virtue were in me increased,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was to him less dear and less delightful;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And into ways untrue he turned his steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pursuing the false images of good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That never any promises fulfil;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Nor prayer for inspiration me availed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By means of which in dreams and otherwise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I called him back, so little did he heed them.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So low he fell, that all appliances<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1125" id="noteref-1125" epub:type="noteref">1125</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For his salvation were already short,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Save showing him the people of perdition.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For this I visited the gates of death,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And unto him, who so far up has led him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My intercessions were with weeping borne.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>God’s lofty fiat would be violated,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If Lethe should be passed, and if such viands</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should tasted be, withouten any scot</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Of penitence, that gushes forth in tears.”</span>

					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turning to me the point of her discourse,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1127" id="noteref-1127" epub:type="noteref">1127</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>She recommenced, continuing without pause,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Say, say if this be true; to such a charge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>My faculties were in so great confusion,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Than by its organs it was set at large.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Awhile she waited; then she said: “What thinkest?</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Answer me; for the mournful memories</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In thee not yet are by the waters injured.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Confusion and dismay together mingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Was needful to the understanding of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a cross-bow breaks, when ’tis discharged</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with less force the arrow hits the mark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I gave way beneath that heavy burden,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the voice flagged upon its passage forth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence she to me: “In those desires of mine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which led thee to the loving of that good,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>What trenches lying traverse or what chains<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1128" id="noteref-1128" epub:type="noteref">1128</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Didst thou discover, that of passing onward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And what allurements or what vantages</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the forehead of the others showed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1129" id="noteref-1129" epub:type="noteref">1129</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>After the heaving of a bitter sigh,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hardly had I the voice to make response,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with fatigue my lips did fashion it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Weeping I said: “The things that present were</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With their false pleasure turned aside my steps,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soon as your countenance concealed itself.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And she: “Shouldst thou be silent, or deny</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What thou confessest, not less manifest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Would be thy fault, by such a Judge ’tis known.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when from one’s own cheeks comes bursting forth</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1130" id="noteref-1130" epub:type="noteref">1130</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For thy transgression, and another time</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1131" id="noteref-1131" epub:type="noteref">1131</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My buried flesh should have directed thee.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never to thee presented art or nature</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By reason of my death, what mortal thing</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Should then have drawn thee into its desire?</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of things fallacious to have risen up</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To follow me, who was no longer such.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To wait for further blows, or little girl,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1132" id="noteref-1132" epub:type="noteref">1132</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or other vanity of such brief use.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The callow birdlet waits for two or three,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But to the eyes of those already fledged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1133" id="noteref-1133" epub:type="noteref">1133</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as children silent in their shame</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And conscious of their fault, and penitent;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So was I standing; and she said: “If thou</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With less resistance is a robust holm</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Uprooted, either by a native wind</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Or else by that from regions of Iarbas,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1134" id="noteref-1134" epub:type="noteref">1134</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Than I upraised at her command my chin;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And when she by the beard the face demanded,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Well I perceived the venom of her meaning.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as my countenance was lifted up,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1135" id="noteref-1135" epub:type="noteref">1135</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had rested from the strewing of the flowers;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, still but little reassured, mine eyes</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That is one person only in two natures.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She seemed to me far more her ancient self</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To excel, than others here, when she was here.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So pricked me then the thorn of penitence,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That of all other things the one which turned me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Most to its love became the most my foe.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Such self-conviction stung me at the heart</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">O’erpowered I fell, and what I then became</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She knoweth who had furnished me the cause.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then, when the heart restored my outward sense,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The lady I had found alone, above me<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1136" id="noteref-1136" epub:type="noteref">1136</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I saw, and she was saying, “Hold me, hold me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, dragging me behind her, she was moving<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1137" id="noteref-1137" epub:type="noteref">1137</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upon the water lightly as a shuttle.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When I was near unto the blessed shore,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“<i xml:lang="la">Asperges me</i>,” I heard so sweetly sung,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1138" id="noteref-1138" epub:type="noteref">1138</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Remember it I cannot, much less write it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beautiful lady opened wide her arms,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where I was forced to swallow of the water.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the dance of the four beautiful,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1139" id="noteref-1139" epub:type="noteref">1139</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And each one with her arm did cover me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1140" id="noteref-1140" epub:type="noteref">1140</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Ere Beatrice descended to the world,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">We as her handmaids were appointed her.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>We’ll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Light that within them is, shall sharpen thine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The three beyond, who more profoundly look.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1141" id="noteref-1141" epub:type="noteref">1141</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus singing they began; and afterwards</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Unto the Griffin’s breast they led me with them,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1142" id="noteref-1142" epub:type="noteref">1142</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,” they said;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Before the emeralds have we stationed thee,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1143" id="noteref-1143" epub:type="noteref">1143</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>A thousand longings, hotter than the flame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As in a glass the sun, not otherwise</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Within them was the twofold monster shining,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1144" id="noteref-1144" epub:type="noteref">1144</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Now with the one, now with the other nature.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1145" id="noteref-1145" epub:type="noteref">1145</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">When I beheld the thing itself stand still,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And in its image it transformed itself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>While with amazement filled and jubilant,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My soul was tasting of the food, that while</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">It satisfies us makes us hunger for it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Themselves revealing of the highest rank</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In bearing, did the other three advance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Singing to their angelic saraband.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1146" id="noteref-1146" epub:type="noteref">1146</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such was their song, “unto thy faithful one,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who has to see thee ta’en so many steps.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In grace do us the grace that thou unveil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thy face to him, so that he may discern</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The second beauty which thou dost conceal.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O splendor of the living light eternal!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>He would not seem to have his mind encumbered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Where the harmonious heaven o’ershadowed thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When in the open air thou didst unveil?</span>

					<span>So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1147" id="noteref-1147" epub:type="noteref">1147</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In satisfying their decennial thirst,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1148" id="noteref-1148" epub:type="noteref">1148</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That all my other senses were extinct,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And upon this side and on that they had</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Walls of indifference, so the holy smile</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew them unto itself with the old net;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When forcibly my sight was turned away</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Towards my left hand by those goddesses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because I heard from them a “Too intently!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And that condition of the sight which is<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1149" id="noteref-1149" epub:type="noteref">1149</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In eyes but lately smitten by the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Bereft me of my vision some short while;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But to the less when sight reshaped itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I say the less in reference to the greater</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Splendor from which perforce I had withdrawn,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I saw upon its right wing wheeled about</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The glorious host returning with the sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As underneath its shields, to save itself,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the whole thereof can change its front,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That soldiery of the celestial kingdom</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Before the chariot had turned its pole.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the Griffin moved his burden benedight,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But so that not a feather of him fluttered.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The lady fair who drew me through the ford</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Followed with Statius and myself the wheel</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which made its orbit with the lesser arc.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So passing through the lofty forest, vacant</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By fault of her who in the serpent trusted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Angelic music made our steps keep time.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Perchance as great a space had in three flights</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">An arrow loosened from the string o’erpassed,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1150" id="noteref-1150" epub:type="noteref">1150</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As we had moved when Beatrice descended.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I heard them murmur altogether, “Adam!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Then circled they about a tree despoiled<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1151" id="noteref-1151" epub:type="noteref">1151</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of blooms and other leafage on each bough.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Its tresses, which so much the more dilate</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As higher they ascend, had been by Indians<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1152" id="noteref-1152" epub:type="noteref">1152</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Among their forests marvelled at for height.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1153" id="noteref-1153" epub:type="noteref">1153</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Since appetite by this was turned to evil.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>After this fashion round the tree robust</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The others shouted; and the twofold creature:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And turning to the pole which he had dragged,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He drew it close beneath the widowed bough,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And what was of it unto it left bound.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1154" id="noteref-1154" epub:type="noteref">1154</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>In the same manner as our trees (when downward</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Falls the great light, with that together mingled</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which after the celestial Lasca shines)<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1155" id="noteref-1155" epub:type="noteref">1155</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Begin to swell, and then renew themselves,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Each one with its own color, ere the Sun</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Harness his steeds beneath another star:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1156" id="noteref-1156" epub:type="noteref">1156</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Less than of rose and more than violet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That had erewhile its boughs so desolate.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I never heard, nor here below is sung,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The hymn which afterward that people sang,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor did I bear the melody throughout.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Had I the power to paint how fell asleep</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1157" id="noteref-1157" epub:type="noteref">1157</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even as a painter who from model paints</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">I would portray how I was lulled asleep;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He may, who well can picture drowsihood.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore I pass to what time I awoke,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And say a splendor rent from me the veil</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of slumber, and a calling: “Rise, what dost thou?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As to behold the apple-tree in blossom<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1158" id="noteref-1158" epub:type="noteref">1158</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Peter and John and James conducted were,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And, overcome, recovered at the word<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1159" id="noteref-1159" epub:type="noteref">1159</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">By which still greater slumbers have been broken,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And saw their school diminished by the loss</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Not only of Elias, but of Moses,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And the apparel of their Master changed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>So I revived, and saw that piteous one<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1160" id="noteref-1160" epub:type="noteref">1160</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Above me standing, who had been conductress</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Aforetime of my steps beside the river,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And all in doubt I said, “Where’s Beatrice?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And she: “Behold her seated underneath</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The leafage new, upon the root of it.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Behold the company that circles her;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The rest behind the Griffin are ascending</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With more melodious song, and more profound.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if her speech were more diffuse I know not,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Because already in my sight was she</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Alone she sat upon the very earth,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Left there as guardian of the chariot</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which I had seen the biform monster fasten.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Encircling her, a cloister made themselves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1161" id="noteref-1161" epub:type="noteref">1161</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“Short while shalt thou be here a forester,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And thou shalt be with me for evermore</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Therefore, for that world’s good which liveth ill,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of her commandments all devoted was,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My mind and eyes directed where she willed.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Never descended with so swift a motion</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out the region which is most remote,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As I beheld the bird of Jove descend<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1162" id="noteref-1162" epub:type="noteref">1162</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Down through the tree, rending away the bark,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As well as blossoms and the foliage new,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And he with all his might the chariot smote,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1163" id="noteref-1163" epub:type="noteref">1163</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thereafter saw I leap into the body</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1164" id="noteref-1164" epub:type="noteref">1164</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That seemed unfed with any wholesome food.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But for his hideous sins upbraiding him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My Lady put him to as swift a flight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As such a fleshless skeleton could bear.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then by the way that it before had come,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Into the chariot’s chest I saw the Eagle</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1165" id="noteref-1165" epub:type="noteref">1165</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And such as issues from a heart that mourns,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said:</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">“My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1166" id="noteref-1166" epub:type="noteref">1166</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And as a wasp that draweth back its sting,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drawing unto himself his tail malign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>That which remained behind, even as with grass</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A fertile region, with the feathers, offered</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Perhaps with pure intention and benign,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The pole and both the wheels so speedily,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Transfigured thus the holy edifice</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Three on the pole and one at either corner.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1167" id="noteref-1167" epub:type="noteref">1167</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>The first were horned like oxen; but the four</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Had but a single horn upon the forehead;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A monster such had never yet been seen!</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Firm as a rock upon a mountain high,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Seated upon it, there appeared to me</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1168" id="noteref-1168" epub:type="noteref">1168</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And, as if not to have her taken from him,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Upright beside her I beheld a giant;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1169" id="noteref-1169" epub:type="noteref">1169</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And ever and anon they kissed each other.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But because she her wanton, roving eye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Turned upon me, her angry paramour</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Did scourge her from her head unto her feet.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1170" id="noteref-1170" epub:type="noteref">1170</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">He loosed the monster, and across the forest</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Dragged it so far, he made of that alone<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1171" id="noteref-1171" epub:type="noteref">1171</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>A shield unto the whore and the strange beast.</span>

					<span class="i1">Now three, now four, melodious psalmody</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The maidens in the midst of tears began;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Beatrice, compassionate and sighing,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Listened to them with such a countenance,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That scarce more changed was Mary at the cross.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But when the other virgins place had given<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1173" id="noteref-1173" epub:type="noteref">1173</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For her to speak, uprisen to her feet</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">With color as of fire, she made response:</span>

					<span>“<i xml:lang="la">Modicum, et non videbitis me</i>;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1174" id="noteref-1174" epub:type="noteref">1174</a></span>

					<br/>
					<span>Then all the seven in front of her she placed;</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And after her, by beckoning only, moved</span>

					<span>So she moved onward; and I do not think</span>

					<span class="i1">That her tenth step was placed upon the ground,</span>

					<br/>
					<span>As soon as I was with her as I should be,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">She said to me: “Why, brother, dost thou not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Venture to question now, in coming with me?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As unto those who are too reverential,</span>

					<span class="i1">So that thou speak no more as one who dreams.</span>

					<span class="i1">Who made it holy for his use alone.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For biting that, in pain and in desire<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1185" id="noteref-1185" epub:type="noteref">1185</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Five thousand years and more the first-born soul</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For special reason so pre-eminent</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">In height, and so inverted in its summit.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1186" id="noteref-1186" epub:type="noteref">1186</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if thy vain imaginings had not been</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Water of Elsa round about thy mind,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1187" id="noteref-1187" epub:type="noteref">1187</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1188" id="noteref-1188" epub:type="noteref">1188</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Thou by so many circumstances only</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The justice of the interdict of God</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Morally in the tree wouldst recognize.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But since I see thee in thine intellect</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Converted into stone and stained with sin,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I will too, if not written, at least painted,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That cinct with palm the pilgrim’s staff is borne.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1189" id="noteref-1189" epub:type="noteref">1189</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>And I: “As by a signet is the wax</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which does not change the figure stamped upon it,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">My brain is now imprinted by yourself.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But wherefore so beyond my power of sight</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Soars your desirable discourse, that aye</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“That thou mayst recognize,” she said, “the school<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1190" id="noteref-1190" epub:type="noteref">1190</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Its doctrine follows after my discourse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And mayst behold your path from the divine</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Distant as far as separated is</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Whence her I answered: “I do not remember</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That ever I estranged myself from you,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“And if thou art not able to remember,”</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Smiling she answered, “recollect thee now</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And if from smoke a fire may be inferred,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Some error in thy will elsewhere intent.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Truly from this time forward shall my words</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Be naked, so far as it is befitting</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And more coruscant and with slower steps</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The sun was holding the meridian circle,<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1191" id="noteref-1191" epub:type="noteref">1191</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>When halted (as he cometh to a halt,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Who goes before a squadron as its escort,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">If something new he find upon his way)</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The maidens seven at a dark shadow’s edge,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Such as, beneath green leaves and branches black,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The Alp upon its frigid border wears.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1192" id="noteref-1192" epub:type="noteref">1192</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">And slowly part, like friends, from one another.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>“O light, O glory of the human race!</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">What stream is this which here unfolds itself</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">From out one source, and from itself withdraws?”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>For such a prayer, ’twas said unto me, “Pray</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Matilda that she tell thee”; and here answered,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As one does who doth free himself from blame,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>The beautiful lady: “This and other things</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Were told to him by me; and sure I am</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And Beatrice: “Perhaps a greater care,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Which oftentimes our memory takes away,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Has made the vision of his mind obscure.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But Eunoë behold, that yonder rises;<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1193" id="noteref-1193" epub:type="noteref">1193</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1194" id="noteref-1194" epub:type="noteref">1194</a></span>
					<br/>
					<span>Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">But makes its own will of another’s will</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">As soon as by a sign it is disclosed,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Even so, when she had taken hold of me,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Said, in her womanly manner, “Come with him.”</span>
					<br/>
					<span>If, Reader, I possessed a longer space</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">For writing it, I yet would sing in part</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Of the sweet draught that ne’er would satiate me;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>But inasmuch as full are all the leaves</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Made ready for this second canticle,</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">The curb of art no farther lets me go.</span>
					<br/>
					<span>From the most holy water I returned</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">Regenerate, in the manner of new trees</span>
					<br/>
					<span class="i1">That are renewed with a new foliage,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars.<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-1195" id="noteref-1195" epub:type="noteref">1195</a></span>
